"Abstract

We model the extent to which age targeted quarantine can be used to reduce ICU admissions caused by novel coronavirus COVID-19. Using demographic data from New Zealand, we demonstrate that lowering the age threshold for quarantine to 50 years of age reduces ICU admissions drastically, and show that for sufficiently strict isolation protocols, isolating one third of the countries population for a total of 6 months is sufficient to avoid overwhelming ICU capacity throughout the entire course of the epidemic. Similar results are expected to hold for other countries, though some minor adaption will be required based on local age demographics and hospital facilities..

","Introduction

COVID-19, initially observed/detected in Hubei province of China during December 2019, has since spread to all but a handful countries, causing (as of the time of writing) an estimated 855,000 infections and 42,000 deaths ( [8] , March 31st). COVID-19 has a basic reproductive number, R 0 , currently estimated in the region of 2.5 -3 [5] . Social distance and general quarantine measures can reduce R 0 temporarily, but not permanently. For R 0 = 3, left unchecked COVID-19 can be expected to infect more than 90% of our community, with 30% of the population infected at the epidemic peak. Even with significant quarantine measures in place the population will not reach ""herd immunity"" to this virus until 2/3 of the population has gained resistance-either through vaccination, or infection and subsequent recovery.In order to place these numbers in a concrete context, a recent survey in New Zealand indicated that the country had a total of 520 ventilator machines [7] . Given the country's demographics (see table 1) , and current estimates of 1 Table 1 : Here we provide demographic data for New Zealand [2] , along with risk of ICU admission per infection for each age group [1] . Finally we give the expected number of ICU admissions, assuming 2/3 rd s of each age category becomes infected over the course of the epidemic-the minimum required to reach herd immunity.Age This is 15 times more demand than could be accommodated in the expected 4 month span of an unmitigated epidemic. The details of this calculation may vary from country to county, but the final conclusion is ubiquitous -hospitals are not prepared for this disease. Efforts to ""flatten the curve"" will need to reduce the epidemic peak not merely by a factor of two, but instead by an order of magnitude or more. Even in the most optimistic scenarios, for the most well equipped countries, such efforts must be maintained for years on end.Societal lockdown may be effective at eradicating COVID-19 locally, but when lockdown is complete a large susceptible population will remain; if the virus is later re-introduced, as expected in our globalized and interconnected world, a new epidemic is likely to occur. While buying time allows for manufacturing of new medical equipment, and further scientific investigations, such efforts can not be maintained indefinitely. For this reason it proves necessary to discuss not just what quarantine measures are needed, but also how society might return to normal, and over what time frame this can be achieved.

Targeted Quarantine and Release

As has been observed in South Korea [4] , death rate is tightly correlated with age. While deaths in younger age categories are observed, a recent report from Italy [3] indicates that the vast majority of deaths occur in patients with known pathologies. It should thus be possible to predict who is most at risk with high 2 .

This leads to a small number of hospitalizations, which the hospital system is able to cope with. 3) The low risk population recovers, and herd immunity is achieved. 4) Quarantine is (cautiously) removed, and high risk individuals are able to return to normal social activity.fidelity. By controlling which 2/3rds of the population become infected we may avoid overtaxing the healthcare system and thus minimise mortality. We consider a strategy in which initially all of society (bar essential service workers) are locked down for two to four weeks so as to brake the initial uncontrolled epidemic spread. At the end of this time, rather then reduce quarantine measures uniformly over all society, a government could instead engage in a program of 'targeted quarantine'; those individuals with no risk factors would be encouraged to return to work and socialize, while at risk individuals would be asked to remain at home under strict quarantine. The infection would be allowed to pass through the large, low risk population, resulting in a small number of ICU admissions due to occasional unexpected complications. Once the epidemic has passed through the low risk population, quarantine measures can be lowered in stages, with each stage exposing successively higher risk populations. Despite the increased risk on the individual level, the reduced susceptible population for each subsequent stage would lead to a natural 'flattening of the curve', 3 . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . and a smaller fraction of these later populations becoming infected. Eventually herd immunity would be achieved, and isolation measures can be safely dropped for the entire population.Similar strategies were alluded to by Ferguson et al [1] , who advised social distancing for those over the age of 70, and investigated explicitly by Chikina & Pegden [6] , who completed a comprehensive sensitivity analysis suggesting a significant reduction in mortality for a wide range of parameters. Both papers however, proposed a fixed age of division (70 and 65 years of age, respectively), and explored what might be considered reasonable parameter ranges in terms of levels of isolation possible, predicting, even in their most optimistic estimates, hundreds of thousands of fatalities. There is, however, no reason to restrict the targeted quarantine threshold to 65 or 70 years of age, and, as we shall show, lowering this age threshold to 50 can reduce fatalities substantially.

The Model

In order to illustrate the general approach described above, we consider a simple SIR type model, in which our population is divided both by disease status (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered), and by age cohort. Here we lump people by decade, as this is the granularity that fatality rates and ICU admission data are reported. We assume fixed recovery rate γ = 0.1 days −1 , and a fixed infection rate β = 0.25 days −1 . Interactions between age cohorts are governed by the contact matrix κ(t). Entry κ i,j gives the contact rate between age cohort i and age cohort j. This is the system parameter that can be changed through public policy and human behavior.In order to simulate targeted quarantine measures, we select some threshold age T , and some time window (t s , t e ) during which quarantine measures apply. We define two contact matrices, one for the quarantine period, and one for the non-quarantine period. These matrices take the form:4 . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .During quarantine, we assume a contact rate κ i,j (t) = κ Q = 0.1, for individuals within the quarantine (i, j > T ), and κ i,j (t) = κ × = 0.1 across the quarantine barrier. Individuals outside of the quarantine group (i, j ≤ T ) have contact rate κ i,j (t) = κ F = N/N nq where N nq is the total population not in quarantine (N q gives the population in quarantine. Similarly S q gives the susceptible population under quarantine, and I nq gives the infectious population not under quarantine). This choice of κ F approximately preserves the total number of interactions experienced by the out of quarantine population.ICU demand at any given time is given by α k I k , where here α k is the probability of ICU admission for age category k (see table 1 ). Cumulative ICU bed demand is α k (I k +R k ). Full R code for all models is publicly available on Github 1 . Readers are encouraged to adapt demographic and clinical parameters based on their own circumstances, and in response to further research.

Results

Simulation of the above system for a range of quarantine thresholds T results in ICU demand as depicted in Figure 2 . Figure 3 summarizes peak ICU demand as a function of T. Peak ICU demand is minimized for a quarantined threshold of T ≈ 40, and total ICU demand is minimized for T ≈ 50.In order to understand the importance of our various quarantine compliance parameters, it proves useful to determine the total number of infections due to ""quarantine leakage"". This value is well approximated byDerivation of this expression is given in the Appendix. Figure 4 gives a visual representation of this expression. Most critically we observe in the above equation that all reductions in κ × lead to a corresponding reduction in infections -halving κ × will (approximately) halve the number of quarantined individuals getting infected. The importance of κ Q depends on its value; whenever γ βκ Q N q /N quarantine measures are strict enough to prevent self-sustaining chains of infection in the quarantine population and κ Q has only moderate impact. However, as κ Q approaches the threshold γ = βκ Q N q /N , the system becomes extremely sensitive to κ Q , and even modest reductions in this contact rate are critical So far we have seen how careful selection of age threshold can reduce ICU admission (figure 3), and also how reducing cross quarantine contact reduces infection ( figure 4 ). This leads naturally to the question of ""What is our best case scenario? How do we get there?"". In figure 3 we showed how a single stage quarantine approach can decrease mortality. In figure 5 we show that a two stage quarantine approach can do even better, under ideal circumstances bringing peak ICU demand below capacity. Given that ICU overflow translates almost directly to patient mortality, this is a very desirable goal.1 https://github.com/alastair-JL/COVID strategy 5 .

Figure 2 : Epidemic curves dependent on where we place our age cut off for quarantine, T. Total Ventilator numbers are given by the black line. Note that the results of quarantining everyone and quarantining no one are largely the same, with quarantine simply delaying the peak. An age cut off of 50 years (teal curve) captures a large enough portion of the population to achieve herd immunity, while reducing fatalities compared to cut offs at 60 or 70 years. Figure 3 : Depending on the placement of our quarantine threshold, both peak and total ICU admissions vary. Given that hospital facilities are rapidly overwhelmed in even the best case scenario above, total ICU demand is expected to be a close proxy for total fatalities. A threshold at 50 years of age minimizes this number.

For the red curve, we assume quarantine of everyone over 50 years of age from day 65 to 160, and quarantine of everyone over 60 years of age from day 160 to 255 (that is to say, 3 month intervals for each stage of isolation). At no point is the under 50 population required to remain in quarantine, although moderate social distancing is required in the first 3 month window. An alternative strategy (blue), extends quarantine until day 290 (an extra month). This extended quarantine of the over 60 group reduces total ICU admissions from 17500 to 11400, and spreads these resulting admissions over a far wider time span.

Logistics

Above we have implemented a variety of possible containment strategies through simply changing a few parameter values. Implementing such policies in real life will be significantly harder. A few of the most pressing logistical issues which need analysis are:• Establishing food delivery infrastructure so that quarantined individuals can stay at home.• Partitioning health care facilities so as to prevent mixing between quarantine groups.• Communication and public education so that people understand both what is required for the approach to work, and how it benefits them.• Rearranging our workforce, given the large number of senior staff who will no longer be available in person.• Identifying new jobs that will need to be carried out, so as to maintain quarantine as effectively as possible?• Investigation and community engagement with 'de-mixing' households, so that people in different quarantine groups are no longer living with one another. Such measures may be disruptive, but are likely necessary if we wish to minimize κ × , and would (for example) involve children staying with aunties and uncles, or family friends, rather than grandparents. Individuals in the quarantine group currently living alone might consider moving in with other quarantined persons, and university students would be required not to return to their parents households.

Assumptions to be Investigated

We have explored means of minimizing the death toll and burden on the medical system. This work is based on a number of assumptions. Each of these assumptions must be verified before any of the above plans are implemented:• We have taken the ICU admission rates provided by Ferguson et al. as our baseline assumption [1] . If it is later found that the ICU admission risk amongst younger generations are higher than expected, it is likely that ICU capacity will be exceeded. Nonetheless, separation of age cohorts still leads to a net improvement in outcome, as it allows the medical system to deal with separate epidemic peaks as opposed to a single larger peak [6] .• We assumed that infection provides immunity, or at least resistance to COVID-19. If it is found that infection does not result in subsequent resistance, or resistance is short lived, then any protocol that depends on herd immunity will fail. 8 . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .• We have made simplifying assumptions about community structure. It is likely that community structure (for example, retirement homes, where high risk individuals interact frequently with other high risk individuals) may increase the threshold required for herd immunity to be acquired.

Opportunities

There are a number of research avenues that may improve upon the outcomes we have described. We have considered a simple age structured population; this was driven primarily by the availability of age structured ICU risk data. With better understanding of the underlying health conditions associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes, and better demographic data on the frequency of these risks, it will be possible to pre-isolate high risk individuals in our under 50 age cohort, and simultaneously, reduce quarantine requirements for individuals over 50 who have a clean bill of health. We assumed a ""predetermined"" epidemic response strategy. Future developments in serological testing would allow more dynamic strategies to be adopted, based on weekly testing of antibody levels in the population; decisions on quarantine measures could then be made based on observed immunity levels in the population, rather than simply occurring at three month intervals. Such screening and feedback would greatly mitigate the various uncertainties in the model. Finally, although here we have considered age-targeted quarantine approaches as they apply to the population of New Zealand, this was merely for the sake of concreteness; nothing in the approach described is specific to that country.Readers are encouraged to make use of our code, and explore the dynamics given their own local demographic data.

Conclusions

While previous authors [1] [6] have alluded to and explored the use of age targeting, they have done so in the limited sense of quarantining retirees, and assumed moderate social distancing measures are implemented. Here we argue that this undersells the potential effectiveness of the targeted quarantine approach; any government willing to take the extraordinary measure of shutting down all of society should, at the very least, consider the significantly less drastic measure of quarantining one third of their population.To the low risk population, our strategy offers a fast return to functional society, and, for those few who do get sick, access to medical facilities and staff who are dealing with a manageable number of cases. To those under isolation, targeted quarantine offers the possibility of avoiding COVID-19 altogether. By releasing a large portion of the population from lockdown after a small number of weeks, age-targeted quarantine balances the need to maintain a functional society and economy, with the limitations of hospital resources, and has the potential to significantly reduce casualties.

"Abstract

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19.Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested individuals from 1.85M to 3.7M using only 671k more tests.This strategy is well-suited to supplement testing for asymptomatic and mild cases who would otherwise go untested, and enable them to adopt behavioral changes to slow the spread of COVID-19.

","Introduction

Group testing was first described in [5] as a technique for screening United States Army recruits for syphilis. In a common extension, samples are organized into a matrix, then each row and column of the matrix are tested [13, 6] . Under either approach, it is well understood that given a sensitive test and low disease prevalence, testing capacity increases dramatically.We propose adapting this technique for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, where COVID-19 prevalence is low and testing is limited. This is in part motivated by work suggesting that population-scale testing for SARS-CoV-2 might effectively reduce asymptomatic transmission [1] . During the past week, as we finalized this manuscript, its application to SARS-CoV-2 testing has been widely suggested and demonstrated [20, 19, 8] .Since group testing is most efficient when prevalence is low, we propose using it to test individuals who do not meet current test criteria. This obviates many concerns around group testing efficacy on the individual level, as critical care resources are not essential for asymptomatic cases. Individuals with a high case probability can be excluded from groups and tested individually using either existing criteria for screening or newly developed survey instruments [16, 17] .While CDC guidelines [4] caution against using negative test results ""as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions,"" testing criteria currently select for symptomatic individuals. Among individuals presently excluded by testing guidelines, we argue that grouped testing is an effective strategy for finding asymptomatic cases that would otherwise be missed.Overall, we propose a very simple pooling strategy ( Figure 1 ) and thoroughly evaluate the relevance of this test to the COVID-19 pandemic. First, on a 96-well plate, pool each row (8) and each column (12) , and perform a total of 20 tests on the pooled samples across the 96 individuals being tested (plus appropriate positive and negative controls). Then, all samples for which both the row and column were positive are re-run in a validation test to determine which individuals are positive. We show below that this strategy works to improve upon existing testing and evaluate the benefits across both simulated and real testing data. 8 

Results

First, we evaluated whether group testing might improve upon existing individual-test methodologies. Testing three pooling strategies -four-well pooling (pooling four adjacent wells in a single dimension), 96-well (8x12) plate column and row pooling, and 384-well (16x24) plate column and row pooling -we found that all improve significantly upon naive testing, and that each performed better for a particular prevalence, as expected ( Figure 2 ). All three required fewer tests than the naive method at prevalence less than 10%. We have implemented these simulations in an R package that is available at https:// gitlab.com/technopolymath/pooled-diagnostics, and an interactive web visualization is available at https://technopolymath.shinyapps.io/pooled_covid_testing/.We additionally wanted to estimate the total saved tests relative to those conducted so far, under the hypothetical that pooling had been used throughout the pandemic. Using testing and positive test estimates from Our World in Data [15] , we chose an optimal testing strategy per country from between 4-well pooling; 96-well plates; and 384-well plates. We chose the strategy per country which minimized the tests needed at the observed prevalence. This resulted in an expected total of 670,849 tests globally to re-test everyone who has previously been screened for SARS-CoV-2 (1.85M individuals), corresponding to a three-fold improvement in cases per test. Ignoring country-specific prevalence data, 96-well plates and between 5-way and 8-way well pooling resulted in an expected ≈ 780, 000 tests (Table S1 ). When considering country-specific prevalence, however, the single strategy which performed best on average across countries was the 96-well plate (at just under a third as many tests as standard approaches; Figure S3 ). These findings suggests that the 96-well plate row and column pooling approach is a straightforward compromise if no information on population prevalence is available.This approach is even better suited to mild and asymptomatic individuals, as population prevalence is most likely substantially lower than observed in the cases tested by most countries, an intuition borne out in recent modeling efforts [14] . We assume that the prevalence estimates from existing testing are biased due to primarily testing symptomatic individuals, and therefore evaluated our approach at a range of prevalence biases ( Figure S2 ). At up to ten-fold lower prevalence than current tests, our approach still discovers more cases per test than existing diagnosis protocols.Together, these results suggest that testing mildly symptomatic, or asymptomatic, individuals using a group testing approach will discover the same number of cases using the same number or fewer tests, albeit in a population with much lower prevalence. This enables large numbers of lower-risk individuals to be tested, either from mild symptomatic individuals or contact tracing, which in turn empowers behavioral change.

Discussion

We propose a pooling extension to existing SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols to boost efficiency and better utilize scarce resources. These are not meant to be a replacement for wide-spread testing, but instead might act as a stop-gap measure to reduce the number of RNA extractions and testing steps performed while still identifying asymptomatic or mild cases. Even so, there are numerous reasons why the use of such strategies is not popular.1. Grouped testing, particularly with an iterative test as here, uses more consumables, such as pipette tips, than traditional methods per test. This is at the benefit of more individuals being tested.2. More complex sample assignment strategies (e.g. probability driven) can reduce the total number of tests but these are difficult to implement in practice. As such, we frame our proposal in terms of the standard 96-well plates and show that a single plate's worth of pooling already is very effective at expected population prevalence, supporting the use of this strategy ( Figure S4 ).3. Similarly, the random assignment of individuals to wells, which is much easier than clinical-risk-driven ordering, has nearly the same improvement ( Figure S1 ). In addition, the total improvement in tests between group testing everyone and only group testing low-risk individuals is nearly indistinguishable at testing prevalence below 10%, suggesting that either is an equally useful option to pursue.3 .

Mixing samples from multiple individuals in a single tube risks contamination. We reiterate that this method should not be used as the sole diagnostic criterion for critical ill patients, but rather can be considered to develop epidemiological parameters and/or perform initial screening in low-risk individuals then follow up with confirmatory tests.5. Interpretation and reporting requirements assume individual testing. In particular, CDC guidelines [4] requires a human RNA positive result (RP+) for an interpretation of ""2019-nCoV not detected"". In the pooled strategy, validation tests will be run on a number of negative cases, which may be sufficient to demonstrate a high RP+ rate on this population. Pooled negatives might be considered as ""Invalid Results"", and thus should not be reported, until such time as RP+ is confirmed individually.6. Picking individual samples to re-test is prone to pipetting errors. We developed a strategy with this in mind, as it only requires re-testing samples from any individual row or column which tests positive as a pool. In this way, the workflow disturbance is minimized. See ""Minimizing pipetting errors"" below.7. If RNA extraction is the limiting step, this approach requires samples to stay stable for the first qPCR run, in order to allow RNA extraction from the positive samples. We note there is some evidence that RNA extraction is not necessary for qPCR of SARS-CoV-2 RNA [3], though more testing is needed.8. This method does not remove any clinical or logistical barriers to obtaining large numbers of individual swabs for testing. As such, it relies on the presence of other infrastructure to obtain prevalence estimates. Alternative strategies for prevalence-only modeling, such as wastewater-based epidemiology [7] , might be more suitable in settings where individual swabs are not available.9. At non-negligible prevalence, a substantial number of tests are still needed to cover large populations.The four-fold improvement we observe at prevalence 2% still results in large numbers of total tests, which might remain above capacity.10. Requiring two stages of qPCR might delay return of results. However, testing resource limitations are also causing delays in the current pandemic, and confirmatory tests are often employed for diagnostics. Finally, for the targeted subset of people who have COVID-19 but do not have severe symptoms, delays may have limited clinical significance or consequences for public health interventions.We encourage further work into better approximate methods for obtaining prevalence estimates through more sophisticated pooling strategies, including using the virus concentration from qPCR (in either equally or unequally pooled samples). In addition, we see great potential of pooling for repeat testing of the same population of individuals on sequential days or weeks. Hospitals, government offices, corporations, and educational institutions, across which many individuals cannot work from home [2] , require self-isolation following positive results. This decreases the case counts below the population average on subsequent days and increases the efficiency of group testing strategies. Among individuals with low risk of serious complications, this methodology could use non-qPCR based assays. For instance, RT-LAMP assays [9, 18, 21, 10] might be particularly well-suited to rapid, first-line screening methodologies at scale. This strategy might also be applied to seropositivity screening once reliable tests are available for COVID-19, though rigorous testing of the pooling of serum is necessary to evaluate this more thoroughly.Further extensions of this approach might be justifiable given the current extreme limitations on testing resources. For instance, testing efficiency can be increased at the expense of specificity by pooling people in close contact (ex. family groups, work units) into a single sample prior to group allocation or RNA extraction. This reduces test volume by a constant factor under the assumption that individuals in close contact have positively correlated infection status and that cluster identification is more vital to suppression than determining a particular individual's infection status. In addition, pooling samples from the same individual (sputum, nasopharyngeal swab, etc) will obtain similar benefits with essentially no loss of information.Overall, we present a straightforward and directly applicable approach to extend testing for SARS-CoV-2 to lower-risk individuals using pooling. While there are numerous technical hurdles left to overcome, we anticipate that strategies such as those proposed here will be valuable in obtaining more accurate estimates of population prevalence and disease spread in the coming months.

Minimizing pipetting errors

Pipetting errors are clearly a large concern in the implementation of this approach, as single missteps are both difficult to detect and result in both false positives and false negatives. We consider multiple possible mitigation strategies:1. Multi-channel pipettes enable simultaneous multi-sample manipulation by hand. Given the gridded nature of our testing system, multi-channel pipettes are likely effective. Multi-channel pipetting into a deepwell plate for pooled sample storage is likely the simplest option. For example, into a 2.5 mL deepwell plate, pipette 150 µL of each pre-extraction row and column sample to yield a total of 1.8 mL of pool for rows and 1.2mL of pool for columns. Then mix thoroughly and extract from standard volumes. We note that this mixing increases risk of operator exposure, so strict biosafety precautions must be adhered to.2. Many SARS-CoV-2 testing laboratories are using pipetting robots to rapidly and accurately scale RNA extractions and assays to large numbers of individuals. While protocols do not exist to our knowledge for group testing on these platforms, they are ideally suited to tasks such as this. We propose such a strategy should be validated using traditional pipetting before using valuable robotic platform resources.3. Finally, in the absence of both robotic and multi-channel automation, pipette guiding tools such as iPipet [22] can be used for suggesting pipetting steps in a fixed order. This reduces the possibility of pipetting errors without requiring a multi-channel pipette, but does require tablet access.Independent of the modest efficiency gains of clinical-risk-driven ordering (as in Figure S1 ), ordering of individual samples so that pipetting order is from low-to high-risk samples minimizes the impact of unintended transfers. In the example strategy in Figure 1 , this would be achieved by placing high-risk samples in the bottom-right.

Supplement

We provide an overview of the simulation methods employed. We evaluated models using a sampling approach, drawing samples from either a Bernoulli distribution with a probability equal to the assumed prevalence, or a beta-Bernoulli distribution with α parameter 5 and β parameter 5/prevalence to account for inter-individual variation in risk. All draws were independent. These were averaged over 1000 replicates to smooth over any sampling noise; sample sizes are adjustable in our web interface. Next, the draws are used to assign true case status for each simulation run. The number of random values thus corresponds directly to the count of cases tested by a given method in a single batch. Of note, the draws from the beta are used as the case probability directly for the row major ordered case prevalence tests ( Figure S1 ), which are only informative under the beta-Bernoulli simulations.Finally, the results with our two-stage approach (pooled screening followed by individual-test followup of potential cases, and optional confirmation of positive status) are compared with corresponding naive screening (individual-test screening followed by optional and default individual-test confirmation of cases). Evaluating different levels of test stringency for both the grouped and naive strategies is part of the web interface.We assume for all methods that samples are distributed at random and independently. However, sample collection for this approach might be conducted through contact tracing and door-to-door sampling, where we expect co-habitation. In these cases, the assumption of lack of correlation of test status between individuals does not hold. We anticipate relevant extensions to this work might address this concern.While the random assignment might at first seem inefficient, we evaluated a number of additional strategies, including ones which use the case probability information, and found that they did not perform meaningfully better than random assignment ( Figure S1 ). As such, given the ease of the random assignment process, we recommend that as a default. Comparison to case ordered alternatives is available on the web interface.Strategies that pool across multiple plates offer further test efficiency gains, depending on the prevalence. Because this dependence is sensitive to prevalence and because using a single 96-well plate is near-optimal at an expected 5% prevalence ( Figure S4 ), we recommend this practically simpler strategy.Sample stratification provides another opportunity for realizing efficiency gains. By separating samples from symptomatic individuals from others, we can artificially decrease prevalence in the individuals tested using pooling, which decreases the tests per individual. This makes it easier to find asymptomatic carriers by expanding test coverage, though practical trade-offs between case abundance and overall testing capacity are worthy of consideration.

"Abstract

Different ways of calculating mortality ratios during epidemics can yield widely different results, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration-dependent SIR model to define individual-and population-based estimates of dynamic mortality ratios. The key parameters that affect the dynamics of the different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the length of time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection. We stress that none of these ratios are accurately represented by the often misinterpreted case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of deaths to date divided by the total number of infected cases to date. Using available data on the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and simple assumptions, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality ratios and highlight their differences. Informed by our modeling, we propose a more systematic method to determine mortality ratios during epidemic outbreaks and discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and errors in the data.

I. INTRODUCTION

The mortality ratio is a key metric describing the severity of a viral disease. It changes in time and can be measured in a number of ways during an epidemic. One common metric is the case fatality ratio (CFR), found by dividing the total number of deaths to date, D(t), by the total number of all cases to date N (t) [1, 2] .In the recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, the CFR has been estimated from aggregated population data. We show examples of CFR curves in Fig. 1 and in the Supplemental Information (SI). As of March 26, 2020 , the global CFR(t) = D(t)/N (t) = 21, 306/472, 762 ≈ 4.5% [3] , while CFRs in individual regions vary significantly. Clearly, this estimate would correspond to an actual mortality ratio only if all the remaining unresolved individuals recover. However, some of these unresolved cases will lead to death and thus to a gradual increase of the estimated mortality ratio over time. Despite the underestimation of this type of population-based measurement, it is still commonly being used by various health officials and is often inconsistently defined as deaths/(deaths + recovereds) even though this difference has been clearly distinguished [4] .During the severe 2003 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, the World Health Organization (WHO) also used the aforementioned estimate to obtain a CFR of 4.5% while the final values approached 17.0% [6, 7] . For the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, analyses by WHO and other institutions still use the CFR = D(t)/N (t) metric (see Table I ). Since actual mortality probabilities are important measures for assessing the risks associated with epidemic outbreaks, typical underestimations by CFRs may lead to insufficient countermeasures and a more severe epidemic [8, 9] .An unambiguous, physiologically-based definition of mortality ratio is the probability that a single, newly infected individual will eventually die of the disease. If there are sufficient individual-level or cohort data, these probabilities can be further stratified according to patient age, gender, health condition, etc. [10] . The mortality ratio or probability of death should be an intrinsic property of the virus and the infected individual, depending on age, health, access to health care, etc. This intrinsic probability ought not to be directly dependent on the population-level dynamics of infected and recovered individuals. Thus, it can in principle be framed by a model for the survival probability of a single infected individual. Whether this individual infects others does not directly affect his probability of eventually dying. In section II A, we derive a model describing the probability M 1 (t) that an infected individual dies or recovers before time t. Importantly, these models incorporate the duration of infection (including an incubation period) before a patient tests positive at time t = 0.However, as mentioned above, the CFR and other mortality measures are typically reported based on population data. Do these population-based measures, including CFR, provide reasonable measures of the probability of death of Estimates of mortality ratios (see Eqs. (8) and (14)) of SARS-CoV-2 infections in China and Italy. The ""delayed"" mortalityratio estimate CFR d corresponds to the number of deaths to date divided by total number of cases at time t − τres. Many studies use CFR d , although this metric underestimates the individual-based mortality (defined below). Another populationbased mortality ratio is Mp(t), the number of deaths divided by the sum of death and recovered cases, up to time t. The data are based on Ref. [5] .reference CFR Xu et al. [1, 11] and Mahase [12] 2 % Wu et al. [2] 0.1-1 % (outside Wuhan) World Health Organization [13, 14] 2-4 % an individual? In section II B, we describe how mortality ratios are defined within population-level models, specifically, a disease duration-structured SIR model. We will show that population-based estimates are typically not a meaningful measure of mortality, but that under simplifying assumptions, the mortality ratio M p (t) is more closely related to the number of deaths to date divided by the number of dead plus the number of recovered individuals to date [4] . In the simplest approximation, the mortality ratio is currently (as of March 26, 2020) 21, 306/(21, 306+114, 749) ≈ 15.7% [3] , significantly higher than the March 26, 2020 CFR≈ 4.5% estimate.We use the same estimates for the rate parameters in our individual and population models to compute the different mortality ratios. Note that in general, both the individual mortality probability M 1 (t) and the population-based estimates M p (t) depend on the time of measurement t. By critically analyzing these estimates and another ad hoc ""delayed"" ratio CFR d , we illustrate and interpret the differences among these measures and discuss how changes or uncertainty in the data affect them. In section III, we summarize our results and identify a correction factor to transform population-level mortality estimates into individual mortality probabilities.

A. Intrinsic individual mortality rate

Consider an individual that, at the time of positive testing (t = 0), had been infected for a duration τ 1 . A ""survival"" probability density can be defined such that P (τ, t|τ 1 )dτ is the probability that the patient is still alive and infected (not recovered) at time t > 0 and has been infected for a duration between τ = t + τ 1 and τ + dτ . Since τ 1 is unknown, it must be estimated or averaged over. The individual survival probability evolves according towhere the death and recovery rates, µ(τ, t|τ 1 ) and c(τ, t|τ 1 ), depend explicitly on the duration of infection at time t and implicitly on patient health and age a [15]. They may also depend explicitly on time t to reflect changes in clinical policy or available health care. For example, enhanced medical care may decrease the death rate µ, giving the individual's intrinsic physiological processes a chance to cure the patient. These intrinsic individual-based death and recovery rates do not directly depend on population-level viral transmission. Equation (1), assuming an initial condition of one particular individual who has been infected for time τ 1 at the time of positive test, can be solved using the method of characteristics. From the solution P (τ, t|τ 1 ) one can derive the probabilities of death and recovery by time t asThe probability that an individual died before time t, conditioned on resolution (either death or recovery), is then defined aswhere we have explicitly indicated the dependence on the duration of the infection prior to confirmation of infection. These formulae also depend on all other relevant patient attributes such as age, accessibility to health care, etc. In the long-time limit, when resolution has occurred (P d (∞) + P r (∞) = 1), the individual mortality ratio is simply. This result relies only on intrinsic individual rate parameters and is completely independent of disease transmission at the population level. In order to capture the dependence of death and recovery rates on the time an individual has been infected, we propose a constant recovery rate c and a simple piece-wise constant death rate µ(τ |τ 1 ) that is not explicitly a function of time t:where τ inc is the incubation-time parameter, the time after infection during which an individual remains asymptomatic. During this incubation period, the patient has zero death rate but can recover by clearing the virus. In other words, some patients fully recover without ever developing serious symptoms. For coronavirus infections, the incubation period appears to be highly variable with a mean of τ inc ≈ 6.4 days [17] . We can estimate µ 1 and c using individual patient data where 19 patients (outside Hubei) had been tracked from the date on which their first symptoms occurred until the disease resolved [16] .Two out of 19 patients died, on average, 20.5 days after first symptoms occurred and the mean recovery time of the remaining 17 patients is 16.8 days. We show the recovery-time distribution in Fig. 2(a) . Since we know that the mortality ratio in this dataset is 2/19, we can determine the dependence between µ 1 and c according to µ 1 /(µ 1 + c) ≈ 2/19 (or c/µ 1 ≈ 8.5). The constant recovery and after-incubation period death rates [18] are estimated to be c = 1 20.5 /day ≈ 0.049/day and µ 1 = c/8.5 ≈ 0.006/day.Using these numbers, the recovery and death rate functions c(τ, t|τ 1 ) and µ(τ |τ 1 ) are plotted as functions of τ in Fig. 2(b) . We show the evolution of M 1 (t|τ 1 ) at different values of τ 1 in Fig. 2(c) . The corresponding long-time limit M 1 (∞) is readily apparent in Fig. 2 (d): for τ 1 ≥ τ inc , M 1 (∞) = µ 1 /(µ 1 +c) ≈ 0.105, while M 1 (∞) < µ 1 /(µ 1 +c) when τ 1 < τ inc . The smaller expected mortality associated with early identification of infection arises from the remaining incubation time during which the patient has a chance to recover without possibility of death. When conditioned on testing positive at or after the incubation period, the patient immediately suffers a positive death rate, increasing his M 1 (∞)..

First, if the outbreak is ongoing, there may not be sufficient long-time cohort data. Second, τ 1 is unknown. Since testing typically occurs at the onset of symptoms, most positive patients will have been infected a few days earlier. The uncertainty in τ 1 can be represented by a probability density ρ(τ 1 ) for the individual. The expected mortality can then be constructed as an average over ρ(τ 1 ):whereP d (t) andP r (t) are the the τ 1 -averaged probabilities death and cure probabilities. Note that this averaging is different from the population-level averagingM 1 (t) = ∞ 0 M 1 (t|τ 1 )ρ(τ 1 )dτ 1 , which would describe the average of mortality ratios over a population with heterogeneous initial durations τ 1 .Some properties of the distribution ρ(τ 1 ) can be inferred from the behavior of patients. Before symptoms arise, only very few patients will know they have been infected, seek medical care, and get their case confirmed (i.e., ρ(τ 1 ) ≈ 0 for τ 1 ≈ 0). The majority of patients will contact hospitals/doctors when they have been infected for a duration of τ inc . The distribution ρ(τ 1 ) thus reaches its maximum near or shortly after τ inc . Since patients are most likely to test positive after experiencing symptoms, we choose a gamma distributionwith shape parameter n = 8 and rate parameter γ = 1.25/day so that the mean n/γ is equal to τ inc = 6.4. Upon using the rates in Eqs. (4) and averaging over ρ(τ 1 ), we derived expressions forP (t),P d (t), andP r (t) which are explicitly given in the SI. Using the values in Eq. (5) we find an expected individual mortality ratioM 1 (t) (which are subsequently plotted in Fig. 3 ) and its asymptotic valueM 1 (∞) =P d (∞) = 0.101. Of course, it is also possible to .

(4) in our subsequent analyses.In the next section, we define population-based estimates for mortality ratios, M p (t), and explore how they can be computed using SIR-type models. By comparing M 1 (t) to M p (t), we gain insight into whether population-based metrics are good proxies for individual mortality ratios. We will outline the mathematical differences and additional errors that confound population-level estimates.

B. Infection duration-dependent SIR model

While individual mortalities can be estimated by tracking many individuals from infection to recovery or death, oftentimes, the available data are not resolved at the individual level and only total populations are given. Typically, one has the total number of cases accumulated up to time t, N (t), the number of deaths to date D(t), and the number of cured/recovered patients to date R(t) (see Fig. 1 ). The CFR is simply D(t)/N (t). Note that N (t) includes unresolved cases and that N (t) ≥ R(t) + D(t). Resolution (death or recovery) of all patients, N (∞) = R(∞) + D(∞), occurs only well after the epidemic passes.A variant of the CFR commonly used in the literature [1, 2] is the delayed CFRwhere τ res is a corresponding time lag that accounts for the duration from the day when first symptoms occurred to the day of cure/death. Many estimates of the COVID-19 mortality ratio assume that τ res = 0 [1, 2] and thus underestimate the number of death cases D(t) that result from a certain number of infected individuals. Similar underestimations using CFR d have been reported in previous epidemic outbreaks of SARS [4, 6] and Ebola [20] . Alternatively, a simple and interpretable population-level mortality ratio is M p (t) = D(t)/(R(t) + D(t)), the death ratio of all resolved cases. To provide a concrete model for D(t) and R(t), and hence M p (t), we will use a variant of the standard infection duration-dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-type model described by [21] and dR(t)/dt = ∞ 0 dτ c(τ, t)I(τ, t), where S(t) is the number of susceptibles, I(τ, t) is density of individuals at time t who have been infected for time τ , and R(t) is the number of recovered individuals. The rate at which an individual infected for time τ at time t transmits the infection to a susceptible is denoted by β(τ, t)S(t).Note that the equation for I(τ, t) is identical to the equation for the survival probability described by Eq. (1). It is also equivalent to McKendrick age-structured models [22, 23] [24] . Infection of susceptibles is described by the boundary conditionwhich is similar to that used in age-structured models to represent birth [22] . Finally, we use an initial condition consistent with the infection duration density given by Eq. (7): I(τ, 0) = ρ(τ ; n = 8, γ = 1.25). Note that Eq. (10) assumes that all newly infected individuals are immediately identified; i.e., these newly infected individuals start with τ 1 = 0. After solving for the infected population density, the total number of deaths and recoveries to date can be found viaThe corresponding total number of cases N (t) in Eq. (8) is. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 26.20044693 doi: medRxiv preprint In the definitions of D 0 (t), R 0 (t), and N 0 (t), we account for all possible death and recovery cases to date (see SI) and that newly infected individuals are immediately identified. We use these case numbers as approximations of the reported case numbers to study the evolution of mortality-ratio estimates. Mortality ratios based on these numbers underestimate the actual individual mortality M 1 (see section II A) since they involve individuals that have been infected for different durations τ , particularly recently infected individuals who have not yet died.An alternative way to compute populations is to exclude the newly infecteds and consider only the initial cohort. The corresponding populations in this case are defined asSince D 1 (t) and R 1 (t) do not include infecteds with τ < t, they exclude the effect of newly infected individuals, but may yield more accurate mortality-ratios as they are based on an initial cohort of individuals in the distant past.The infections that occur after t = 0 contribute only to I(τ < t, t); thus, D 1 (t) and R 1 (t) do not depend on the transmission rate β or the number of susceptibles S(t). Note that all the populations derived above implicitly average over ρ(τ 1 ; n, γ) for the first cohort of identified infecteds (but not subsequent infecteds). Moreover, the population density I(τ ≥ t, t) follows the same equation asP (t|τ 1 ) provided the same ρ(τ 1 ; n, γ) is used in their respective calculations.The two different ways of partitioning populations (Eqs. (11) and (13)) lead to two different population-level mortality ratiosSince the populations D 0 (t) and R 0 (t), and hence M 0 p (t), depend on disease transmission through β(τ, t) and S(t), we expect M 0 p (t) to carry a different interpretation from M 1 (t) and M 1 p (t). In the special case in which µ and c are constants, the time-integrated populations Thus, only in the special time-homogeneous case do both population-based mortality ratios become independent of the population (and transmission β) and coincide with the individual death probability.To illustrate the differences between M 1 (t), M 0,1 p (t), and CFR d (t, τ res ) in more general cases, we use the simple death and cure rate functions given by Eqs. (4) in solving Eqs. (1) and (9) . For β(τ, t) in Eq. (10), we account for incubation effects by neglecting transmission during the asymptomatic incubation period (τ ≤ τ inc ) and assumeWe use the estimated basic reproductive number R 0 = β 1 S(0)/(µ 1 + c) ≈ 2.91 [17] to fix β 1 S(0) = (µ 1 + c)R 0 ≈ 0.158/day. We also first assume that the susceptible population does not change appreciably before quarantine and set S(t) = S(0). Thus, we only need to solve for I(τ, t) in Eqs. (9) and (10). We solve Eqs. (9) and (10) numerically (see the Methods section for further details) and use these numerical solutions to compute D 0,1 (t), R 0,1 (t), and N 0,1 (t) (see Fig. 3(a) and (b) ), which are then used in Eqs. (14) and CFR d (t − τ res ). To determine a realistic value of the time lag τ res , we use data on death/recovery periods of 36 tracked patients [16] and find that patients recover/die, on average, τ res = 16.5 days after first symptoms occurred. We show in Figs. 3(c) and (d) that M 1 p (t) approaches the individual mortality ratioM 1 (∞) ≈ 0.1 of section II A. This occurs because the model for P (τ, t) and I(τ, t) are equivalent and we assumed that the initial distribution of τ for both quantities are given by ρ(τ ; 8, 1.25). However, the population-level mortality ratios CFR d (t, τ res ) and M 0 p (t) also take into account recently infected individuals who may recover before symptoms. This difference yields different mortality ratios because newly infecteds are implicitly assumed to be detected immediately and all have τ 1 = 0. Thus, the underlying infection-time distribution is not the same as that used to computeM 1 p (t) (see SI for further details). The mortality ratios CFR d (t, τ res ) and M 0 p (t) should not be used to quantify the individual mortality probability of individuals who tested positive after their incubation period. During the course of an outbreak, the measures CFR d (t, τ res ) and M 0 p (t) are subject to another confounding influence. Since D(t), R(t), and N (t) do not .

The death and recovery rates are defined in Eqs. (4) and (5). We use a constant infection rate β1S(0) = 0.158/day, which we estimated from the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 [17] . To model quarantine effects, we set β1 = 0 for t > 50. We show the mortality-ratio estimates M 0 p (t) and M 1 p (t) (see Eq. (14)) and CFR d (t, τres) (see Eqs. (8), (11) , (12) , and (14)).change with the same rates at the same time, these population-level mortality estimates only reach their steady state after sufficiently long times (see Fig. 3 (c) and (d)).To summarize, we described two confounding factors that complicate the direct use of population-level mortality ratio to estimate individual mortality probabilities. First, infection-time distributions ρ(τ ; n, γ) that are meaningful on an individual level may not correspond to those in population-level data. Second, population-level mortality ratios are often time-dependent and most informative only in the steady state after the outbreak stopped.The evolution of the mortality ratios in Fig. 3 qualitatively resembles the behavior of the mortality-ratio estimates in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1 , the population-based estimates for coronavirus varies, decreasing in time for China but fluctuating for Italy. These changes could result from changing practices in data collecting, or from explicitly time-inhomogeneous parameters µ(τ, t), c(τ, t), and/or β(τ, t).Although population-level quarantining does not directly affect the individual mortality M 1 (t|τ 1 ) orM 1 (t), it can be easily incorporated into the SIR-type population dynamics equations through changes in β(τ, t)S(t). For example, we have set S(t > t q ) = 0 to represent implementation of a quarantine after t q = 50 days of the outbreak. After t q = 50 days, no new infections occur and the estimates CFR d (t, τ res ) and M 0 p (t) start converging immediately towards their steady-state values (see Fig. 3(d) ). Since the number of deaths decreases after the implementation of quarantine measures, the delayed CFR d (t, τ res = 17) is first decreasing until t = t q + τ res = 67. For t > 67, the CFR d (t, τ res = 17) measures no new cases and is thus equal to the CFR.

III. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

After an outbreak, it is important to assess the severity of the disease by estimating its mortality and other disease characteristics. Assuming accurate data, the often-used CFR and delayed CFR typically underestimate the true, final death ratio. For example, during the SARS outbreaks in Hong Kong, the WHO first estimated the fatality rate to 2.5% (March 30, 2003) whereas the final estimates reached values of about 17.0% (June 30, 2003) [7] . Standard metrics like the CFR are seen to be easily confounded by and sensitive to uncertainty in intrinsic disease parameters . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. such as the incubation period and the time τ 1 a patient had been infected before clinical confirmation of infection. For the recent COVID-19 outbreaks, CFR-based measures may still provide reasonable estimates of the actual mortality across different age classes due to a counter-acting error in the numbers of unreported mild-symptom cases.Here, we stress that more mechanistically meaningful and interpretable metrics can be defined and be as easily estimated from data as CFRs. Our proposed mortality ratios for viral epidemics are defined in terms of (i) individual survival probabilities and (ii) population ratios using numbers of deaths and recovered individuals. Both of these measures are based on the within-host evolution of the disease, and in the case of M 0,1 p (t), the population-level transmission dynamics. Thus, these metrics directly incorporate key parameters operating on the weeks or months timescale, the incubation time τ inc and time of prior infection τ , through the solution of age-structured PDEs. Among the metrics we describe, M 1 p (t) is structurally closest toM 1 (t) in that both are independent of transmission β since new infections are not considered. Both of these converge after an incubation time τ inc to a value smaller than or equal to µ 1 /(µ 1 + c).The most accurate estimates of M 1 can be obtained if we keep track of the fate of cohorts that were infected within a small time window in the past. By following only these individuals, one can track how many of them died as a function of time. As more cases arise, one should stratify them according to estimated τ to gather improving statistics for M 1 (∞). These data should also be collated according to the other central factor in COVID-19 mortality: patient age. With the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 in different countries, data on more individual cases of death and recovery can be more easily stratified by age, health condition, and other individual characteristics. Using identical initial infection time distributions ρ(τ 1 ; n, γ) (see Eq. (7)), the long-time limit of M 1 p (t) approaches the individual mortalityM 1 (∞) (see Eq. (6)).Besides accurate cohort data, for which at present there are few for coronavirus, cumulative population data has been used to estimate the mortality ratio. The metrics M 0 p (t) and CFR(t) are based on these aggregate populations but implicitly depend on new infections and the transmission rate β. Despite this confounding factor, M 0 p (t) and CFR d (t, τ res ) approach e −cτinc µ 1 /(µ 1 + c) as t → ∞, where e −cτinc is the probability that no recovery occurred during the incubation time τ inc . Based on these results, we can establish the following connection between the different mortality ratios for initial infection times with distribution ρ(τ 1 ; n, γ) and meanτ = n/γ:According to Eq. (17), population-level mortality estimates (e.g., CFR and M 0 p ) can be transformed, at least approximately, into individual mortality probabilities using the correction factor e −cτ withτ ≈ τ inc .Besides the mathematical differences between M 1 (t) and M 0 p (t), CFR, estimating M 0 p (t) and CFR(t) from aggregate populations implicitly incorporate a number of confounding factors that lead to variability in these estimates. In Fig. 4 , we plot the population-level mortality-ratio estimates M 0 p against the CFR for different regions and observe large variations and very little correlation between countries [25] . As of March 26, 2020, the value of M 0 p in Italy is almost 45% and can increase further if the current conditions (e.g., treatment methods, age group proportion of infecteds, etc.) do not change. Differences between the mortality ratios in China and Italy (see Figs. 1(b) and (c) ) might be a result of varying medical treatment strategies, different practices in data collecting (e.g., post-mortem testing), and differences in the age demographics between the countries..

However, the newly infecteds that contribute to CFR and M 0 p (t) at later times may not all be tested or may be tested at different times after they were infected. A reported/tested fraction f < 1 would not directly affect the CFRs or mortality ratios if the unreported/untested individuals die and recover in the same proportion as the tested infecteds. Undertesting will overestimate true CFR or mortality rates if the untested infecteds are less likely to die than the tested infecteds. In other words, if the untested (presumably because they were mildly or asymptomatic) population predominantly recovers instead of dying, the actual CFR and mortality ratios would be significantly lower than those based on tested individuals. If untested infecteds do not die, the asymptotic mortality of all infected individuals M 0,1 p (∞) ≈ M 0,1 p (∞) (see the SI). Current estimates show that only a minority of SARS-CoV-2 infections are reported (e.g., f ≈ 14% in China before January 23, 2020) [26] .Besides under-reporting, the delay in transmission after becoming infected will also affect M 0 p (t). Although we have assumed that transmission occurs only after the incubation period when symptoms arise, there is evidence of asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus [26, 27] . Asymptomatic transmission can be modeled by setting β(τ ) > 0 even for τ < τ inc . An undelayed transmission in a nonquarantine scenario causes relatively more new infecteds who have not had the chance to die yet, leading to a smaller mortality ratio M 0 p (t). Within our SIR model, delaying transmission reduces the number of infected individuals and deaths at any given time but increases the measured mortality ratio M 0 p (t). Without quarantine, the asymptotic values M 0 p (∞) and CFR(∞) will also change as a result of changing the transmission latency period, as shown in the SI. With perfect quarantining, the asymptote M 0 p (∞) is eventually determined by a cohort that does not include new infections and is thus independent of the transmission delay.In this work, we have explicitly defined a number of interpretable mathematical metrics that represent the risk of death. By rigorously defining these metrics, we are able to reveal the inherent assumptions and factors that affect their estimation. Within survival probability and SIR-type models, we explicitly illustrate how physiologically important parameters such as incubation time, death rate, cure rate, and transmissibility influence the metrics. We also discussed how statistical factors such as time of testing after infection (τ 1 ) and testing ratio (f ) affect our estimates. Given the uncertainty in the testing fraction, we conclude that M 1 (t) and M 1 p (t) is best interpreted as approximately the mortality probability conditioned on being tested positive. In practice, these are probably also good estimates of mortality of patients conditioned on showing symptoms. In addition to our metrics and mathematical models, we emphasize the importance of curating individual cohort data. These data are more directly related to the probability of death M 1 (t) and are subject to the fewest confounding factors and statistical uncertainty.

METHODS

To numerically solve Eqs. (9) and (10), we used a uniform discretization τ k = k∆τ, k = 0, 1, . . . , K. A backward difference operator [I(τ k , t) − I(τ k−1 , t)] /(∆τ ) is used to approximate ∂ τ I(τ, t) and a predictor-corrector Euler scheme is used to advance time [28] . Setting the cut-off I(−∆τ, t) ≡ 0 and I(K∆τ, t) ≡ 0, the resulting discretized equations for the full SIR model arewhereĨ is the initial predicted guess, and the last term proportional to δ k,0 encodes the boundary condition Eq. (10) . Note that we use K k=0 β(τ k , t)I(τ k , t)∆τ to indicate the numerical evaluation of ∞ 0 dτ β(τ , t)I(τ , t). Quadrature methods such as Simpson's rule and the trapezoidal rule can be used to approximate the integral more efficiently..

Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public 12 health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne 13 pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; 14 however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are 15 both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207-16 222 nm) efficiently kills bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its 17 strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) 18 layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller 19 dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them.

Airborne-mediated microbial diseases represent one of the major challenges to worldwide public 26 health 1 . Common examples are influenza 2 , appearing in seasonal 3 and pandemic 4 forms, and bacterially-27 based airborne-mediated diseases such as tuberculosis 5 , increasingly emerging in multi-drug resistant 28 form.

29

A direct approach to prevent the transmission of airborne-mediated disease is inactivation of the 30 corresponding airborne pathogens, and in fact the airborne antimicrobial efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) 31 light has long been established 6-8 . Germicidal UV light can also efficiently kill both drug-sensitive and 32 multi-drug-resistant bacteria 9 , as well differing strains of viruses 10 . However, the widespread use of 33 germicidal ultraviolet light in public settings has been very limited because conventional UVC light 34 sources are a human health hazard, being both carcinogenic and cataractogenic 11,12 . 35 By contrast, we have earlier shown that far-UVC light generated by filtered excimer lamps 36 emitting in the 207 to 222 nm wavelength range, efficiently kills drug-resistant bacteria, without 37 apparent harm to exposed mammalian skin [13] [14] [15] . The biophysical reason is that, due to its strong The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/240408 doi: bioRxiv preprint

Virus inactivation. Fig. 1 shows representative fluorescent 40x images of mammalian epithelial cells 50 incubated with airborne viruses that had been exposed in aerosolized form to far-UVC doses (0, 0.8, 1.3 51 or 2.0 mJ/cm 2 ) generated by filtered 222-nm excimer lamps. Blue fluorescence was used to identify the 52 total number of cells in a particular field of view, while green fluorescence indicated the integration of 53 live influenza A (H1N1) viruses into the cells. Results from the zero-dose control studies (Fig. 1 Fig. 2 shows the surviving fraction, as a function of the incident 222-nm far-UVC dose, of 57 exposed H1N1 aerosolized viruses, as measured by the number of focus forming units in incubated 58 epithelial cells relative to unexposed controls. Linear regressions (see below) showed that the survival 59 results followed a classical exponential UV disinfection model with rate constant k=1.8 cm 2 /mJ (95% 60 confidence intervals 1.5-2.1 cm 2 /mJ). The overall model fit was good, with a coefficient of 61 determination, R 2 = 0.95, which suggests that most of the variability in virus survival was explained by 62 the exponential model. The rate constant of 1.8 cm 2 /mJ corresponds to an inactivation cross-section 63 (dose required to kill 95% of the exposed viruses) of D95 = 1.6 mJ/cm 2 (95% confidence intervals 1.4-1.9 64 mJ/cm 2 ).

We have developed an approach to UV-based sterilization using single-wavelength far-UVC 68 light generated by filtered excilamps, which selectively inactivate microorganisms, but does not produce 69 biological damage to exposed mammalian cells and tissues [13] [14] [15] .

74

Here we applied this approach to test the efficacy of the 222-nm far-UVC light to kill influenza 75 A virus (H1N1) carried by aerosols in a benchtop aerosol UV irradiation chamber, which generated 76 aerosol droplets of sizes similar to those generated by human coughing and breathing. Aerosolized 77 viruses flowing through the irradiation chamber were exposed to UVC emitting lamps placed in front of 78 the chamber window.

As applied more recently, airborne ultraviolet germicidal 95 irradiation (UVGI) utilizes conventional germicidal UVC light in the upper part of the room, with 96 louvers to prevent direct exposure of potentially occupied room areas 21 . This results in blocking more 97 than 95% of the UV radiation exiting the UVGI fixture, with substantial decrease in effectiveness 22 . By 98 contrast, use of low-level far-UVC fixtures, which are potentially safe for human exposure, could 99 provide the desired antimicrobial benefits without the accompanying human health concerns of 100 conventional germicidal lamp UVGI.

101

A key advantage of the UVC based approach, which is in clear contrast to vaccination 102 approaches, is that UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes. For example, while 103 there will almost certainly be variations in UVC inactivation efficiency as different influenza strains 104 appear, they are unlikely to be large 7,10 . Likewise, as multi-drug-resistant variants of bacteria emerge, 105 their UVC inactivation efficiencies are also unlikely to change greatly 9 .

Finally it is of course by no means the case that all microbes are harmful, and it is well 107 established that the human microbiome is essential to human health 23 .

"Abstract

The newly emergent human virus SARS-CoV-2 is resulting in high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems. Preventing further transmission is a priority. We analysed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact-tracing needed to stop the epidemic. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines ('lock-downs') that are harmful to society. We discuss the ethical requirements for an intervention of this kind.

","IV.

Environmental transmission: transmission via contamination, and specifically in a way that would not typically be attributable to contact with the source in a contact survey (i.e., this does not include transmission pairs who were in extended close contact, but for whom in reality the infectious dose passed via the environment instead of more directly). These could be identified in an analysis of spatial movements.We acknowledge that boundaries between these categories may be blurred, but defined broadly these categories have different implications for prevention, responding differently to classical measures of case isolation and quarantining contacts (9) (10) (and for a specific application to COVID-19 see below (11)).Evidence exists for each of these routes of transmission: symptomatic (12), pre-symptomatic (13) ; asymptomatic (14) ; and environmental (12). For prevention, the crucial information is the relative frequency of different routes of transmission so as to allocate finite resources between different intervention strategies.

Estimating SARS-CoV-2 transmission parameters

We used the exponential growth rate of the epidemic, r, from the early stages of the epidemic in China, such that the effect of control measures discussed later will be relative to the early stages of an outbreak, exemplified by baseline contact patterns and environmental conditions in Hubei during that period. We note that this assumption is implicit in many estimates of R0. The epidemic doubling time T2 is equal to loge(2) / r. We used the value r = 0.14 per day (20) , corresponding to a doubling time of 5.0 days.The incubation period is defined as the time between infection and onset of symptoms. It is estimated as the time between exposure and report of noticeable symptoms. We used the incubation period distribution calculated by (21) . The distribution is lognormal with mean 5.5 days, median 5.2 days and standard deviation 2.1 days, and is included with our results in Fig. 1 .The generation time is defined for source-recipient transmission pairs as the time between the infection of the source and the infection of the recipient. Because time of infection is generally not known, the generation time is often approximated by the serial interval, which is defined as the time between the onset of symptoms of the source and the onset of symptoms of the recipient. We did not take that approach here; instead, we directly estimated the generation time distribution from 40 source-recipient pairs. These pairs were manually selected according to high confidence of direct transmission inferred from publicly available sources at the time of writing (March, 2020), and with known time of onset of symptoms for both source and recipient. We combined dates of symptom onset with intervals of exposure for both source and recipient (when available) and the above distribution of incubation times and from these inferred the distribution of generation times. The distribution is best described by a Weibull distribution (AIC=148.4, versus 149.9 for gamma and 152.3 for lognormal distribution) with mean and median equal to 5.0 days and standard deviation of 1.9 days, shown in the left panel of Fig. 1 .

Uncertainty in the fit of the distribution is shown in Fig. S1 . Our distribution is robust with respect to the choice of transmission events (Fig. S2) . Correlation in the uncertainty between the inferred mean and standard deviation is shown in Fig. S3 . The distribution of serial intervals for these pairs is shown in Fig. S4 . The countries from which the transmission pair data was obtained are shown in Fig. S5 .For each of the 40 transmission pairs we estimated the posterior probability that transmission was presymptomatic, i.e., occurred before the onset of symptoms in the infector. We used a Bayesian approach with an uninformative prior (transmission before or after symptoms equally likely). The 40 probabilities inferred are shown in the right panel of Fig. 1 ; the mean probability is 37% (95% CI:27.5% -45%), which can be interpreted as the fraction of pre-symptomatic transmission events out of pre-symptomatic plus symptomatic transmission events. This mean probability over all pairs approximates our prior, but the bimodal distribution of individual probabilities in Fig. 1 shows that these are typically far from the prior, i.e., the data are strongly informative. Uncertainty in the value of this fraction is shown in We decompose ( ) into four contributions that reflect our categorization above, namely asymptomatic transmission, pre-symptomatic transmission, symptomatic transmission, and environmental transmission. The area under the curve of one of these contributions gives the mean total number of transmissions over one full infection, via that route -asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, symptomatic or environmental -which we define to be RA, RP, RS and RE respectively. The sum of these is R0.The mathematical form for ( ) is: s( ) is the infectiousness of an individual currently either symptomatic or pre-symptomatic, at ageof-infection . Other parameters in this expression, and those feeding into it indirectly, are listed in Table 1 . A detailed discussion of this expression including its assumptions is found in the By drawing input parameter sets from the uncertainties shown in Table 1 , we quantified our uncertainty in R0 and its four contributions. The resulting values are shown in Table 2 the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.08.20032946 doi: medRxiv preprintWe define as the fraction of all transmissions that do not come from direct contact with a symptomatic individual: 1 − & / 0 . This corresponds to the of (9) in the case where there is only pre-symptomatic and symptomatic transmission. From Table 2 We developed our mathematical model of infectiousness into a web application where users can test the effect of alternative parameter combinations (25).

Modelling case isolation and contract tracing with quarantine

We modelled the combined impact of two interventions: (i) isolation of symptomatic individuals, and (ii) tracing the contacts of symptomatic cases and quarantining them. These interventions aim to stop the spread of the virus by reducing the number of transmissions from both symptomatic individuals and from their contacts (who may not be symptomatic), while minimizing the impact on the larger population. In practice, neither intervention will be successful or possible for 100% of individuals.The success rate of these interventions determines the long-term evolution of the epidemic. If the success rates are high enough, the combination of isolation and contact tracing/quarantining could bring R below 1 and therefore effectively control the epidemic.An analytical mathematical framework for the combined impact of these two interventions on an epidemic was previously derived in (9).

Our results are shown in Fig. 3 . The black line shows the threshold for epidemic control: combined success rates in the region to the upper right of the black line are sufficient to reduce R to less than one. The x axis is the success rate of case isolation, which can be thought of either as the fraction of symptomatic individuals isolated, assuming perfect prevention of transmission on isolation, or the degree to which infectiousness of symptomatic individuals is reduced assuming all of them are isolated. The y axis is the success rate of contact tracing; similarly, this can be thought of as the fraction of all contacts traced, assuming perfectly successful quarantine upon tracing, or the degree to which infectiousness of contacts is reduced assuming all of them are traced. These results for intervention effectiveness, and their dependence on all parameters in our combined analysis, can be explored through the same involves the minimum imposition possible and that decisions in policy and practice are guided by three moral values: equal moral respect, fairness, and the importance of reducing suffering (28) . It is noteworthy that the algorithmic approach we propose avoids the need for coercive surveillance, since the system can have very large impacts and achieve sustained epidemic suppression, even with partial uptake. People should be democratically entitled to decide whether to adopt this platform. The intention is not to impose the technology as a permanent change to society, but we believe it is under these pandemic circumstances it is necessary and justified to protect public health.

Discussion

In this study, we estimated key parameters of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, using an analytically solvable model of the exponential phase of spread and of the impact of interventions. Our estimate of R0 is lower than many previous published estimates, for example (12), (29), (30). These studies assumed SARS-like generation times; however, the emerging evidence for shorter generation times for COVID-19 implies a smaller R0. This means a smaller fraction of transmissions need to be blocked for sustained epidemic suppression (R < 1). However, it does not mean sustained epidemic suppression will be easier to achieve because each individual's transmissions occur in a shorter window of time after their infection, and a greater fraction of them occurs before the warning sign of symptoms. Specifically, our approaches suggest that between a third and a half of transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic individuals. This is in line with estimates of 48% of transmission being presymptomatic in Singapore and 62% in Tianjin, China (31), and 44% in transmission pairs from various countries (32). Our infectiousness model suggests that the total contribution to R0 from presymptomatics is 0.9 (0.2 -1.1), almost enough to sustain an epidemic on its own. For SARS, the corresponding estimate was almost zero (9), immediately telling us that different containment strategies will be needed for COVID-19.Transmission occurring rapidly and before symptoms, as we have found, implies that the epidemic is highly unlikely to be contained by solely isolating symptomatic individuals.

Using mobile phones to measure infectious disease contact networks has been proposed previously (34-36). Considering our quantification of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we suggest that this approach, with a mobile phone App implementing instantaneous contact tracing, could reduce transmission enough to achieve R < 1 and sustained epidemic suppression, stopping the virus from spreading further. We have developed a web interface to explore the uncertainty in our modelling assumptions (25). This will also serve as an ongoing resource as new data becomes available and as the epidemic evolves.We included environmentally mediated transmission and transmission from asymptomatic individuals in our general mathematical framework. However, the relative importance of these transmission routes remain speculative based on current data. Cleaning and decontamination are being deployed to varying levels in different settings, and improved estimates of their relative importance would help inform this as a priority. Asymptomatic infection has been widely reported for COVID-19, e.g., (14) , unlike for SARS where this was very rare (37). We argue that the reports from Singapore imply that even if asymptomatic infections are common, onward transmission from this state is probably uncommon, since forensic reconstruction of the transmission networks has closed down most missing links. There is an important caveat to this: the Singapore outbreak to date is small and has not implicated children. There has been widespread speculation that children could be frequent asymptomatic carriers and potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 (38,39).We calibrated our estimate of the overall amount of transmission based on the epidemic growth rate observed in China not long after the epidemic started. Growth in Western European countries so far appears to be faster, implying either shorter intervals between individuals becoming infected and transmitting onwards, or a higher R0. We illustrate the latter effect in Figs S18 and S19. If this is an accurate picture of viral spread in Europe and not an artefact of early growth, epidemic control with only case isolation and quarantining of traced contacts appears implausible in this case, requiring the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.08.20032946 doi: medRxiv preprint This paper Suggestion from (19) All rights reserved.

"Abstract

Introduction: More than 93,000 cases of coronavirus disease have been reported worldwide. We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 U.S. patients with COVID-19.We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by CDC during January 20-February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing.Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from 7/10 patients.In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long. Hospitalized patients showed signs of worsening in the second week after illness onset.for use under a CC0 license.

","INTRODUCTION

In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel disease COVID-19 caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China. As of March 4, 2020, more than 93,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported in 73 countries, 1 and 80 confirmed and presumptive patients with COVID-19 have been identified in the United States; 2 one has been previously described in detail. 3 SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, and the relationship to the clinical course of COVID-19 are not fully understood. We report the epidemiology, clinical course, clinical management, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed in the United States.

Case identification and confirmation

Local health departments in consultation with clinicians identified patients under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 beginning January 17, 2020. PUI testing criteria changed during this period but included the presence of fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) and at least one epidemiologic risk factor in the two weeks before symptom onset. During January 17-31, epidemiologic risk factors were history of travel from Wuhan City, close contact with an ill PUI, or close contact with a patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. 4, 5 Beginning February 1, epidemiologic risk factors changed to close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19 or history of travel from mainland China. 6 During both time periods, close contact was defined as being within 6 feet for a prolonged period of time 7 or contact with respiratory secretions. 8 Specimens from PUIs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal [NP] , oropharyngeal [OP] ) and available lower respiratory tract specimens (sputum) were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). 3 A case of COVID-19 was defined as identification of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in ≥1 specimen from a patient. We included patients with COVID-19 who were confirmed by CDC during January 20-February 5, 2020.

Data and follow-up specimen collection

Patients with COVID-19 were interviewed by public health officials to collect information on demographics, exposures, travel history, and symptoms, including signs or symptoms before presentation. For all twelve patients, available medical records were reviewed. For hospitalized patients, clinicians systematically abstracted clinical data from the medical record.Illness day 1 was defined as the first day of reported COVID-19 signs and symptoms; collection date of the first SARS-CoV-2-positive specimen was used for one patient with no clear symptom onset date. When symptoms at onset or onset dates in the medical record differed from those reported from the public health interview, the latter were used. Results for virologic tests were reported relative to illness day 1. Duration of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was defined as dates of travel to China or dates of first to last exposure to a U.S. patient with COVID-19. Fever was defined as subjective fever or temperature ≥100.4 °F.We requested collection of NP swabs, OP swabs, sputum (if available), serum, urine, and stool from each patient initially for every 2-3 days for the first 17 days of illness for SARS-CoV-2 virologic testing. 9for use under a CC0 license.

Forms used in this response were approved under OMB, number 0920-1011. Data were analyzed and visualized using Excel, SAS 9.4, R 3.6.2, and Python 3.7.3. 10-13 Laboratory Methods Specimens were evaluated using SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, whole genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Virus culture was attempted from early SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory specimens (NP swabs, OP swabs, and sputum) from 9 patients. Further virus culture is ongoing. Detailed methods are included in the Appendix.

Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics

Twelve patients with confirmed COVID-19 were identified in six states. Five patients received only outpatient care and were isolated at home (Patients 1-5), and seven were hospitalized (Patients 6-12) ( Figure 1 ). Median patient age was 53 years (range: 21-68); eight patients were male ( Table 1) . Four of five patients with ≥1 underlying medical conditions were hospitalized (Tables 1 and 2) .Dates of illness onset ranged from January 14 through 29. Ten patients traveled to mainland China in the two weeks before illness onset, including nine to Wuhan City. Two patients' only reported exposure was close contact with a previously identified U.S. patient with COVID-19. Among all patients, the duration of potential exposure ranged from 5 days to over 1 month; the time between last date of possible exposure and illness onset ranged from 0-5 days.The most commonly reported signs or symptoms at illness onset were cough (n=8) and subjective or measured fever (n=7) ( Table 1) . Two patients reported neither fever nor cough at onset, though they did develop them subsequently: one reported diarrhea as the initial symptom (one day before fever and cough), and the other reported sore throat.Over the course of illness, patients reported cough (n=12), subjective or measured fever (n=9), diarrhea (n=3), and vomiting (n=2). Three patients who did not report fever were never hospitalized and remained on home isolation. Of these, one patient reported only cough and rhinorrhea; one patient reported only cough which began before travel to China and did not change from the initial onset until resolution; and one patient reported cough, chills, fatigue, headache, and nausea.

Clinical course of hospitalized patients

The clinical course for each hospitalized patient is described in the Appendix. The median duration of fever was 9 days (range: 2-11). Peak body temperature during hospitalization occurred at a median of illness day 9 (range: 4-10) ( Figure 2 ). All hospitalized patients had oxygen saturation <94% on room air at some point during their illness, with the oxygen saturation nadir (range: 86-93%) occurring at a median of illness day 12 (range: 4-23) (Figure 2 ). Five patients reported difficulty breathing, and four received supplemental oxygen (Table 2; Figure 1 ). Patient 9 required high-flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation and intensive care monitoring.for use under a CC0 license. This article is a US Government work.

Three, including one who also received corticosteroids, received the investigational antiviral remdesivir (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California) under expanded access (compassionate use) for a duration of 4-10 days. Following remdesivir initiation, all had transient gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, gastroparesis, or rectal bleeding. No other post-remdesivir symptoms were observed. Patient 9 reported loose stool and rectal bleeding and had traveled in Mexico before illness onset; stool later tested positive for Giardia and Clostridiodes difficile. Remdesivir was discontinued after improvement in each patient's respiratory symptoms.Blood cultures were negative in 6/6 hospitalized patients tested, including those obtained from four patients treated empirically for bacterial pneumonia. Molecular testing for influenza A and B on respiratory specimens was negative, and multi-pathogen respiratory PCR panels were negative for all targets in all hospitalized patients (Table 2) .

Laboratory and radiographic findings among hospitalized patients

Six of seven hospitalized patients had leukopenia (<4000 cells/µl), and the white blood cell count nadir occurred at a median of illness day 9 (range: 4-15) ( Figure 1 ). Procalcitonin levels were <0.15 ng/ml in five of six patients who had levels checked. Aminotransferase levels were elevated in all hospitalized patients: AST levels peaked (median peak value 129 U/L, range 46-190 U/L) at a median of illness day 13 (range 7-19) and ALT levels peaked (median peak value 136 U/L, range 66-389 U/L) at a median of illness day 14 (range: 6-23). Three of seven hospitalized patients had mild elevations in alkaline phosphatase levels >115 U/L (maximum value 163 U/L). Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels >600 U/L, coinciding with clinical deterioration, were observed in two patients tested. No major elevations in serum total bilirubin (7 patients tested) or prolongations in prothrombin time (4 patients tested) were identified. Among the three remdesivir recipients, aminotransferase elevation developed in Patient 6 one day after starting remdesivir and in Patient 8 four days after starting remdesivir. Patient 9 had aminotransferase elevation at illness days 6-7 before starting remdesivir; aminotransferase levels started to decrease but increased again five days after starting remdesivir.Unilateral or bilateral pulmonary opacities were seen on chest imaging at some point for all seven hospitalized patients (Table 2) . Four hospitalized patients did not have any abnormalities identified on initial chest radiograph (illness day range: 4-9). Patient 7 had an abnormal chest computed tomography scan on the day of the normal chest radiograph (day 7).

Virologic testing

Initial SARS-CoV-2 testing All 12 patients had respiratory specimens collected between illness days 1-9 (median, day 4), and all tested positive in ≥2 specimen types ( Figure 3 ). Among initial diagnostic specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in OP (11/11 patients), NP (10/12 patients), and sputum (4/4 patients). Viable SARS-CoV-2 virus was cultured from 5/6 initial NP specimens, 4/7 initial OP specimens, 3/3 initial sputum specimens, and 1/1 additional sputum specimen collected 3 days after the initial specimens ( Figure 3 ). Virus was cultured from two patients who were not hospitalized ( Figure 3 ).

Serial SARS-CoV-2 testing

As of February 22, 398 specimens were collected and tested from the 12 patients throughout the course of illness. All 12 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in at least one NP swab, 11/12 in an OP swab, 6/6 in sputum, 1/12 in serum, 7/10 in stool, and 0/10 in urine ( Figure 3 ). Among 98 pairs of simultaneous NP and OP specimens, 58 (59%) had concordant results. Among 27 discordant pairs with one positive for use under a CC0 license.This article is a US Government work. It is not subject to copyright under 17 USC 105 and is also made available author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20032896 doi: medRxiv preprint specimen, the NP specimen was positive in 70%; the remaining 13 discordant pairs had one negative and one inconclusive specimen. Two patients provided sputum specimens when NP and/or OP specimens tested negative, and sputum continued to be positive in both patients. In Patient 7, viral RNA was detected in sputum 17 days after the last positive OP specimen and ≥2 weeks after reported symptom resolution. In seven patients who had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in stool, most detections occurred when viral RNA was still detectable in the respiratory tract. Among three patients who reported diarrhea, all had viral RNA detected in stool.Mean Ct values in positive specimens were 17.0-39.0 for NP, 22.1-39.7 for OP, and 24.1-39.4 for stool. Ct values were lower in the first week of illness than the second in most patients ( Figure S1 ); in some patients, low Ct values continued into the 2 nd and 3 rd week of illness. There was no apparent relationship between Ct values in the upper respiratory tract and disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR results turned positive in serum of Patient 9 in the second week of illness at the time of rapid clinical deterioration.Serial testing to determine duration of RNA detection and viral shedding is ongoing. As of February 22, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected at a maximum of day 26 in NP specimens, day 26 in OP, day 29 in sputum, and day 25 in stool ( Figure 3 ). The duration of viral RNA detection did not differ by hospitalization status or supplemental oxygen requirement.

Outcomes

As of February 22, all patients reported symptom resolution (Figure 1 ). Eleven patients reported cough, (often intermittent) as the last symptom. Median symptom duration was 14 days (range: 6-20). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in 7/11 patients, including in NP (n=6), OP (n=2), sputum (n=1), and stool (n=3) specimens. As of February 22, one patient remained hospitalized, and five patients remained on home isolation. Home isolation was discontinued for 6 patients per CDC criteria; 14 the last respiratory specimens with a positive or inconclusive test result were collected from these patients on days 12-29.

Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

Complete genome sequences were generated from respiratory specimens from all 12 patients. The sequences had >99% nucleotide identity to 85 reference sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes; phylogenetic tree analysis identified a few distinct subgroups ( Figure S2 ) which were not divergent from each other, indicating that the outbreak may still be in an early stage.

DISCUSSION

We describe the first 12 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the United States, including clinical course of the first 7 hospitalized patients. Nine patients had traveled to Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak, one had traveled to China but not to Hubei Province, and two had close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19 in the United States, representing domestic human-to-human transmission. Illness ranged from mild to moderately severe, and hospitalized patients showed signs of clinical worsening in the second week. All patients recovered or are improving, and three patients tolerated treatment with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in upper and lower respiratory specimens, stool, and serum. The highest viral RNA levels were detected in upper respiratory tract specimens, typically during the first week of illness. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from the initial respiratory specimens of mild and moderately ill patients. Viral RNA was still detected after reported symptom resolution for seven patients.

[15] [16] [17] [18] Initial case identification in China focused on hospitalized patients with pneumonia, but recent reports have described a milder clinical course, consistent with our findings. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Among hospitalized patients in this report, the second week of illness was characterized by clinical or laboratory signs of worsening such as hypoxemia, increase in fever, or elevation of aminotransferases. Although some patients received empiric antibiotic treatment for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia, no definitive evidence of bacterial co-infection was found. Worsening in the second week of illness is consistent with previous reports 15, 17 and highlights the importance of close monitoring beyond the first week of illness, even in patients with mild illness or no initial radiographic abnormalities.Patient 9, the most severely ill among this series, experienced sudden clinical deterioration late in the second week of illness. This was the only patient with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in serum, and detection in serum was temporally related to clinical deterioration. Similar observations have been described previously. 24, 25 Increased proinflammatory cytokines have been observed in patients with COVID-19, 17 and it is possible that cytokine dysregulation and endothelial dysfunction contribute to both clinical worsening and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum.Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 shedding is important to understand transmission and guide prevention strategies. We detected viral RNA and cultured virus from upper respiratory specimens, even from patients with lower respiratory tract illness. In general, Ct values in upper respiratory tract specimens were lowest during the first week of illness (suggesting high RNA counts), consistent with previous reports. 25-27 SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in respiratory tract specimens for 2-3 weeks in most patients and for up to 29 days as of February 22. In two patients with a productive cough, viral RNA was detected in sputum after RNA was no longer detectable in NP or OP specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels and duration of RNA detection did not appear to vary by illness severity, and several patients had viral RNA detected in respiratory specimens after reported symptom resolution.We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool of multiple patients; testing continues to assess if this represents viable virus. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from one patient's stool in China 28 but the implications for transmission are unclear. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the serum of one hospitalized patient but did not detect RNA in urine. More data are needed to better understand how duration of RNA detection, RNA levels, and viable virus are related to symptom progression, illness severity, and transmission.Three hospitalized patients received the investigational antiviral remdesivir under expanded access (compassionate use) at the time of clinical worsening based upon a decision by each patient's clinician. Remdesivir inhibits viral replication through premature termination of RNA transcription. 29, 30 In vitro studies have demonstrated that remdesivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in non-human cells. 31 Because remdesivir use was not given as part of a randomized controlled trial, we are unable to assess its effectiveness or safety. Randomized controlled trials of remdesivir are underway. [32] [33] [34] Two hospitalized patients received corticosteroids. WHO interim guidance for clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection with suspected COVID-19 advises against use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason. 35 Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. Our sample of patients is small. Information collected from patient interviews may have been subject to response bias. The threshold for admitting patients and for monitoring in the hospital was likely lower than for other respiratory infections because of uncertainty about the clinical course of COVID-19.

Clinical laboratory tests and radiographic studies were ordered as a part of routine patient care and were not collected systematically. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection does not necessarily reflect the presence of infectious virus, and rRT-PCR Ct values may have varied due to specimen collection or handling. Specimen collection is ongoing to inform both clinical management and infection prevention and control practices, and findings will be updated as more information becomes available.

Conclusions

Characterization of the first 12 patients with COVID-19 identified in the United States, including 7 hospitalized patients, provides key insight into the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These patients experienced mild to moderately severe illness. Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness. Early and prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA suggest the window for diagnosis of COVID-19 is long. Although duration of infectiousness is unclear, our early data show viable virus can be cultured readily from upper respiratory tract specimens soon after illness onset. Further investigations are needed to understand clinical course, immunologic response, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, and transmission, to inform clinical management and public health strategies to prevent disease spread.

"Abstract

We investigate the transmissibility of coronavirus for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using the Ningbo Covid-19 data 1 . Through more in-depth and comprehensive statistical analysis, we conclude that there is no difference in the transmission rates of coronavirus between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which is consistent with the original findings in Chen et al. 1

","Introduction

Since outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019, the coronavirus has spread over the world at an unprecedented rate. By April 2, 2020, more than 150 countries have been affected by Covid-19 with a total of close to one million confirmed cases and over 47,000 deaths. The Covid-19 has been declared as an international public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO).During the incubation period, a percentage of coronavirus carriers may have no symptoms or minimal symptoms and thus often go undetected. These covert coronavirus carriers may not even be aware of the infection themselves, who however would be confirmed as positive cases if tested using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). If the percentage of asymptomatic carriers is large and if their transmissibility of coronavirus is as high as the symptomatic cases, this would pose a great threat to the public. Therefore, it is critical to determine the percentage and transmissibility of asymptomatic coronavirus carriers in the population.It has been reported that the viral load detected in the asymptomatic patients was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which suggests the potential transmissibility of asymptomatic patients. 2 

Issues in the Original Analysis

The estimated transmission rates for the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were 0.063 and 0.041 respectively, and the chi-squared test yielded a p-value of 0.288, which indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between the two transmission rates. They further investigated the transmission rates for different relationships and different types of contact with the infected patients including both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and concluded that the differences in the transmission rates are statistically significant across different relationships and types of contact respectively. The closer the contact with the infected patients, the higher chance of infection.However, in their original statistical analysis 1 , the chi-squared tests were unduly used because the counts in some cells of the contingency tables are rather small and even zeros, which violates the assumptions of a chi-squared test and thus casts doubt on the validity of the hypothesis test. Moreover, when comparing the transmission rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, Chen et al 4 included the cases associated with a super-spreader who mainly transmitted the disease in an air-conditioned bus and a buddhism activity gathering. However, this may reduce the generalization of the findings as the super-spreader should be regarded as an outlier and removed from the primary analysis.

Reanalysis of the Ningbo Covid-19 Data

From January 21st to March 6th 2020, there were 157 symptomatic cases and 30 asymptomatic cases in the Ningbo Covid-19 data 1 . These infected cases resulted in 2147 close contacts with them, among which 2001 exposures were caused by the symptomatic cases and 146 by the asymptomatic cases. The average number of close contacts by the symptomatic cases is 13 and that by the asymptomatic cases is 5, and the difference is statistically significant with a p-value of 6×10 -6 from a permutation test . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050740 doi: medRxiv preprint described in Algorithm 1. The larger number of close contacts by the symptomatic cases may be due to the medical attentions they received after the confirmed diagnosis.To allow for small cell counts including zeros in the contingency table, Fisher's exact tests 5 are used to investigate the difference in the transmission rates between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. We consider two scenarios: One combines the numbers of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases as the total number of infected patients, leading to a 2×2 table; and the other separates them, leading to a 2×3 table, as shown in the top panel of Table 1 .From the results summarized in Table 1 , we conclude that there is no significant difference in the transmission rates between the symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, either including or excluding the cases associated with the super-spreader. However, the tests excluding the cases associated with the super-spreader yield larger p-values, 0.842 when combining the numbers of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and 0.107 when separating them. As a result, there is no evidence in the data to rule out the transmissibility of asymptotic carriers in comparison with symptomatic cases.The odds ratio, estimated transmission rates and their difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases as well as the corresponding 95% confidence intervals are presented in the bottom panel of Table 1 . The odds of transmitting the coronavirus to a healthy individual by a symptomatic patient is 1.2 times of that by an asymptomatic patient, which however is not statistically significant as the 95% confidence interval covers one. Furthermore, as the 95% confidence intervals for the difference of transmission rates cover zero, we conclude there is no difference in the transmissibility of coronavirus through close contacts between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, which is consistent with the findings using Fisher's exact tests.The transmission rates under different relationships with the infected cases are significantly different with both p-values <10 -6 whether combining the symptomatic .

With regard to different types of contact, the transmission rates are also significantly different with p-values <10 -6 . As expected, the more close contacts with the infected cases, the higher likelihood to contract the coronavirus.

Conclusion

In summary, we provide a more in-depth analysis of the Ningbo Covid-19 data to examine the difference in the transmissibility of coronavirus for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. We adopt more appropriate statistical methods, such as Fisher's exact tests, which require no assumptions on the cell counts in the contingency table. We provide the odds ratio, estimated transmission rates, as well as the corresponding 95% confidence intervals, and the conclusions remain the same that there is no statistically significant difference in the transmissibility of coronavirus between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. .

"Abstract

Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 initially appeared and has most rapidly spread in Wuhan, China. The case fatality rate is the most direct indicator to assess the hazards of an infectious disease. We aimed to estimate the instant fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province.We collected the daily case notification data of COVIDin Wuhan City and Hubei Province officially announced by the Chinese authority. The numbers of daily confirmed/deaths/cured cases and the numbers of daily cumulative confirmed/deaths/cured cases were obtained. The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases. Then the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were obtained on the basis of the median death or medium cure time, respectively. Finally, the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was calculated according to the numbers of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates.From Jan 1, 2020 to Feb 22, 2020 in Wuhan City, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.4%～19.5% and the instant cured rate was 80.0%～96.6%. The average fatality rate reached 11.4% while the average cure rate was 88.6%. During the same period in Hubei Province, the instant case fatality rate was 3.8%～16.6% and the instant cured rate was 83.4%～96.6%. The average fatality rate and the average cure rate were 9.2% and 91.8%, respectively.The fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province were underestimated. Wuhan showed higher fatality rate and cure rate than the whole Hubei Province did.

","Introduction

The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) 1 initially appeared in Wuhan, China is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). WHO announced that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [2] [3] [4] . As of Mar. 10, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China has reached to 80955, of which 3162 were dead, and 61567 were cured.Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province are most affected and account for at least 90% of the cases. At present the outbreak in China has been basically controlled. However, the cases of COVID-19 have rapidly increased in other 109 countries around the world, such as South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Singapore, United States and so on. As of Mar 10, 2020, the total number of patients has risen sharply to 32778 outside China, and 876 patients has died. 5 The global outbreak is getting worse.Assessing the hazards of infectious diseases is a vital important concern in epidemiology. 6 The case fatality rate, standing for the percentage of deaths from a disease in the total number of infected-patients during the whole outbreak, is the direct one to reflect the severity of the disease. The accurate case fatality rate of an infectious disease could be obtained after the outbreak is over, on the basis of the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths. Given the severity of COVID-19 outbreak situation throughout the world, it is important to estimate and predict the fatality rate of COVID-19 in the early stage for the hazard evaluation, which might provide the basis for the setting of public security strategy, the allocation of health resources and the adjustment of medical treatment work. It might be also of great help to the government's decision-making and the public's understanding.However, the mortality of COVID-19 published recently in some articles and the ""fatality rate"" announced by authority is neither mortality nor fatality rate. 7, 8 Since the All rights reserved.

In the present study, we established a method to estimate the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 even the outbreak is still on. We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 announced by the Chinese official.The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were obtained from individual cases.The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were then calculated. Finally, the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was estimated according to the numbers of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates.

Research design

The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases. Then, the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and the estimated diagnosis dates of cure cases of COVID-19 were respectively calculated on the basis of the median death time or median cure time. Finally, the instant case fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 were obtained based on the numbers of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates.

Data collection

We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province from Dec 8, 2019 to Feb 29, 2020. 9 The data included the numbers of daily confirmed/deaths/cured cases and the numbers of daily cumulative confirmed/deaths/cured cases. Two researchers collected the data independently every single day, and then checked and corrected the data each other.

Data analysis

We collected 134 deaths and 536 cured cases. Basing on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases, the death time of COVID-19 patients was the period from diagnosis dates to death dates of the deaths, while the cure time of COVID-19 patients was the period from diagnosis dates to discharge dates of cured cases (figure 1). the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034215 doi: medRxiv preprint 

FR = NCD / (NCD + NCCC)×100%

The daily cure rate (CR) is calculated from the number of NCCC divided by a sum of the number of NCD and NCCC on the same estimated diagnosis date.

Statistical analysis

Excel 2016 and GraphPad Prism 8 were used to record, calculate and analyze data.

Daily new cases

The curves of daily new COVID-19 cases reported in Wuhan City and Hubei Province were shown in Figure 3 . The confirmed cases initially occurred on Dec 8, 2019. The number of daily new confirmed cases started to increase in early January. The number markedly increased in late January, 2020, peaked in mid-February, and then decreased gradually.

The COVID-19 patients were initially cured on Jan10, 2020. The number of daily new cured patients began to increase in mid-January, obviously increased in early and mid-February, still maintained a high level in late February, 2020, and then decreased in the early March. The numbers of daily new confirmed cases, daily new deaths and daily new cured cases in Wuhan City were higher than those in Hubei Province. The characteristics in Hubei Province and Wuhan City were similar. 

Daily cumulative cases

The daily variation curves of cumulative cases of COVID-19 including cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative deaths and cumulative cured cases in Wuhan City and HubeiProvince were shown in Figure 4 . The number of cumulative confirmed cases began to increase in early January. The increase is sharply accelerated in late January, and stabilized till the early March. The cumulative death toll started to show increase trend in mid-January. The number was remarkably increased in early February, and the number increase slowed down in late February. The number of cumulative cured cases showed an increase tendency in mid-January. The increase was visibly accelerated in early February, and maintain stable till the early March.All rights reserved.

Estimation of diagnosis dates of the deaths and cured cases

The confirmed patients would eventually have two endpoints: death or cure. We assumed that the dead patients died on the 8th days, the median death time, after diagnosis. The diagnosis date of the dead patient should be 8 days prior to that date. That is, the estimated diagnosis date (Dd) of the deaths is the date 8 days before the announced death date (Di).

Dd = D (i-8).

Similarly, we assumed that cured patients are discharged on the 16th days, median cure time, after diagnosis. The estimated diagnosis date of the cure cases is the date 16 days before the announced cure date [D (i -16)].

Dd = D (i-16)

We calculated the diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases basing on the median death or cure times, respectively. Figure 6 shows the curves of the numbers of cumulative deaths and the number of cumulative cured cases of COVID-19 on the estimated diagnosis dates.The number of confirmed cases was equal to the sum of the number of cumulative cured cases and the number of cumulative death toll on the same estimated diagnosis date. Since the numbers of COVID-19 death toll on the same day was significantly less than the numbers of cured cases, the curve of estimated confirmed COVID-19 cases which was the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034215 doi: medRxiv preprint the sum of cumulative cured cases and cumulative death toll, was close to the curve of cumulative cured cases. The shapes and trends of the curves was in Wuhan City are similar to, but lower than those in Hubei province. 

Instant fatality rates

The instant fatality rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City was less than 10% (3.4-9.9%) from Jan 1 to Jan 13, 2020, and gradually increased to 14.2%-19.5% in mid to late January. In February, the instant case fatality rate gradually decreased and stabilized at 6.5% ( figure   7A ). The average case fatality rate was 11.4%. The instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 in Hubei Province showed the same trend of that in Wuhan City, but the case fatality rates were lower than that in Wuhan City. The instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 in Hubei Province was 10% (3.8-9.1%) from Jan 1 to Jan 13, 2020, then increased to 10.0%-16.6% in late January, and decreased to 5.6% on February 22, 2020 (figure 7B). The average case fatality rate was 9.2%. The curve tendency showed that the case fatality rates were still in decline step by step after February 22, 2020.All rights reserved.

Instant cure rates

The cure rate and case fatality rate are opposite since cure and death are a pair of competing events. The instant cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City was between 80.0%-96.6%, while the rate in Hubei Province was between 83.4%-96.6%. The instant cure rate was lower in second half of January than that in other time. Then the rate gradually increased. On February 22, the instant cure rate increased to 93.5 % in Wuhan, and 94.4%in Hubei ( figure 7) . The cure rate was likely to continue to increase little by little after February 22, 2020.

Discussion

The accurate case fatality rate of an infectious disease can be obtained after the outbreak is over. At present, the outbreak of COVID-19 is ongoing throughout China and All rights reserved.

The numbers of confirmed cases, deaths and cured cases are constantly changing. 10 Therefore, estimating the case fatality rate is obviously challenging. However, it is critical to balance the socioeconomic burden of infection control interventions against their potential benefit for mankind. 8 We assumed that the case fatality rate of the whole outbreak process could be regarded as a collection of many successive instant case fatality rates.

This instant case fatality rate will gradually approach the case fatality rate as time goes on till the outbreak ends gradually. The extreme instant fatality rate can be used as an approximate value of case fatality rate within certain period of time.This approach provides a way to accurately calculate the fatality rate, which is not affected by hospitalized patients.We set the instant unit of case fatality rate as a day, and calculated the daily case fatality rate. The daily case fatality rate was equal to the daily cumulative number of deaths divided by the number of deaths plus the number of cured patients. The number of daily confirmed cases is equal to the number of deaths plus the number of cured cases. The confirmed COVID-19 patients had to go through a certain period of time, which is the death time or the cure time, and then result in the final outcomes: death or cure. The date of deaths minus death time is the diagnosis date of deaths. Similarly, the cure date minus the cure time is the diagnosis date of cured patients. The daily case fatality rate and cure rates were then calculated using the cumulative number of deaths and cured cases at the same diagnosis date. This rate varies from day to day with disease-related factors.The outbreak of COVID-19 firstly appeared in Wuhan, where the situation was most serious with the highest case fatality rate of China. The case fatality rate varied over time.In the first half of January, the fatality rate was less than 10% because the outbreak was not very serious and prevalent. It was easy for patients to see a doctor. But till the beginning of February, the number of patients largely increased and it was difficult for patients to receive medical care treatment. The admission and diagnosis of COVID-19were delayed, the hospitals were crowded out, and medical condition was deteriorated. As a result, the case fatality rate rose sharply to 20%. In February, a large number of domestic All rights reserved.

The treatment concept and methods were updated, the medical level was improved, and the treatment procedure became more and more standardized. On the other hand, the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 may decline as the virus passes through the generations. The proportion of severe cases decreased, and the fatality rate decreased to nearly 6.5%. Basing on this trend, we speculate that the case fatality rate would further decline.The trend in Hubei Province was similar to that in Wuhan, but the case fatality rate was low. The case fatality rate in the first half of January 2020 was less than 10%. From the second half of January to the beginning of February, it rose to 10% ~16.6%, and then decreased to 5.6% on February 22. The fatality rate was expected to fall down further.This study has some limitations. The major influencing factors were mean cure time and death time. The death time was calculated based on the 134 death cases, and the cure time was based on 536 discharged cases. They may deviate from reality and affect the results. We suggest that the government discloses cases of infectious diseases for scientific study to share the resources. Accurate cure time and death time was obtained, it may help to accurately calculate the case fatality rate, and to provide a basis for prevention and control of infectious disease.

"Abstract

Germline variation at immunoglobulin gene (IG) loci is critical for pathogen-mediated immunity, but establishing complete reference sequences in these regions is problematic because of segmental duplications and somatically rearranged source DNA. We sequenced BAC clones from the essentially haploid hydatidiform mole, CHM1, across the light chain IG loci, kappa (IGK) and lambda (IGL), creating single haplotype representations of these regions. The IGL haplotype is 1.25Mb of contiguous sequence with four novel V gene and one novel C gene alleles and an 11.9kbp insertion. The IGK haplotype consists of two 644kbp proximal and 466kbp distal contigs separated by a gap also present in the reference genome sequence. Our effort added an additional 49kbp of unique sequence extending into this gap. The IGK haplotype contains six novel V gene and one novel J gene alleles and a 16.7kbp region with increased sequence identity between the two IGK contigs, exhibiting signatures of interlocus gene conversion. Our data facilitated the first comparison of nucleotide diversity between the light and IG heavy (IGH) chain haplotypes within a single genome, revealing a three to six fold enrichment in the IGH locus, supporting the theory that the heavy chain may be more important in determining antigenic specificity.

","Introduction

Antibodies are essential components of the immune system that play key roles in processes associated with innate and adaptive immunity 1 . They are expressed by B-cells as either cell surface receptors or secreted proteins, and are formed by two pairs of identical ""heavy"" and ""light"" immunoglobulin (IG) protein chains, encoded by genes located at three primary loci in the human genome: the IG heavy chain (IGH) at 14q32.33, and the two IG light chain regions, lambda (IGL) and kappa (IGK), located at 22q11.2 and 2p11.2 2 . Specifically, through a unique mechanism referred to as V-(D)-J recombination 3 , individual Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) genes at the IGH locus, and V and J genes at either the IGK or IGL loci recombine somatically at the DNA level to generate templates for the subsequent transcription and translation of antibody heavy and light chains, respectively. V-(D)-J recombination is accompanied by the random addition and deletion of nucleotides at the junctions of the combined V, D, and J genes by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT). The extreme variability observed in expressed antigen-naïve B-cell antibody repertoires is due to this combinatorial and junctional diversity, and partly ensures that the immune system is able to recognize and mount effective immune responses against a diverse range of potential pathogens. At the population and species level, IG haplotype and allelic variation also make important contributions to the diversity of expressed antibody repertoires [4] [5] [6] [7] ; however, broader roles of IG genetic polymorphism in antibody function are generally less well understood 8 .Over the past three decades, extensive catalogues of genetic polymorphisms have been established for human IGH, IGK, and IGL genes (IMGT; the international ImMunoGeneTics information system; www.imgt.org 2, 9 ) . Importantly, not only has IG genetic diversity recently been implicated in inter-individual variation in expressed antibody repertoires [4] [5] [6] , but genetic variants in both IG coding regions and well-characterized regulatory motifs are also known to influence antibody expression and function, and mediate risk of disease phenotypes 10-12 . However, our understanding of germline variability at the IGH, IGK, and IGL loci remains severely limited, especially in terms of haplotype structure (i.e., large segmental duplications and deletions) as well as coding and non-coding sequence polymorphisms. We have begun to uncover this variability in the IGH locus, leading to complete nucleotide resolution descriptions of large structural variants (insertions, deletions, duplications, and complex rearrangements), including novel functional IGHV genes and alleles 7 .In the present study we use the same approach as our previous characterization of IGH to analyze complete haploid reconstructions of the IGK and IGL loci, which to date, compared to IGH, remain less well investigated. The IGL region has only been fully sequenced and analyzed once in its entirety 13 , using multiple cosmid and BAC library resources. The region spans approximately 0.9 MB, and includes 69 IGLV, seven IGLJ, and seven IGLC functional/open reading frame (ORF) genes and pseudogenes. Additional V, J, and C genes not present in this haplotype are known to occur as insertion variants in the human population 2, [14] [15] [16] . Similarly, the initial sequence of the IGK locus was generated from a composite assembly of cosmid, bacteriophage, and BAC clone libraries 17 . A unique feature of the IGK locus is that it includes two large inverted segmental duplications (SDs) that comprise distinct V-gene containing regions (termed proximal and distal); these regions remain separated by a large, currently unsequenced, assembly gap. The proximal region spans 0.54 MB and includes 69 IGKV functional/ORF genes and pseudogenes, whereas the distal region spans 0.43 MB and includes 62 V genes and pseudogenes (distal V genes are denoted by a ""D""; e.g., IGKV1D-13), five functional IGKJ genes, and a single functional IGKC gene also reside downstream of the proximal V gene cluster.Haplotypes spanning the IGK proximal region, and a portion of the distal region have also been sequenced using BAC clones from the RPCI-11 library 18 . Both IGL and IGK are known to exhibit V, J, and C gene allelic and structural variation 2,14-16,19-21 .As a means to improve existing genomic resources in the IG loci, we have sequenced the IGK and IGL gene clusters from the CHORI-17 BAC library (CH17, BACPAC resources), previously constructed from a haploid hydatidiform mole cell line (CHM1htert). Together with data produced previously for the IGH locus from the CH17 library 7 , these sequences represent the first complete human haplotypes of all three IG loci from a single individual. Using these data, we have conducted the first comparison of genetic diversity between the three IG regions in the same haploid genome. Our analyses have facilitated the identification of novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within IGL and IGK gene coding regions and regulatory elements, and also revealed a novel large sequence conversion event between the IGKV proximal and distal regions. In addition, our unbiased tri-locus comparison shows a striking enrichment of structural and nucleotide diversity in the IGH locus, confirming previous suggestions that germline variation within the light chain gene loci is lower than that observed in IGH 15, 22, 23 .

IGL and IGK reference sequences from the CH17 BAC library

We analyzed sequences from 17 CH17 BAC clones (IGL, 9; IGK, 8) comprising tiling paths across the two loci (Figures 1 and 2 ) --one of the clones in IGK, CH17-198L18, had been sequenced previously. Clones unique to either IGK or IGL were then used to construct locuswide contigs; clones in IGKV proximal and distal regions were aligned separately because the gap separating these two regions was not completely filled by the current sequencing effort. Figure 1) . In total, we identified 37 of the 38 known functional/ORF IGLV genes, seven functional J genes, and four functional C genes. The remaining IGLV gene, IGHV5-39 was not found in CH17, consistent with it being an insertion polymorphism 15, 21 . Sequence comparisons within IGLV, IGLJ, and IGLC genes revealed allelic differences between CH17 and the Kawasaki haplotype at six V genes, two J genes, and one C gene (Figure 1 ; Supplementary Table 1 ). Six of these alleles, five of which were novel (IGLV6-57, IGLV11-55, IGLV5-45, IGLV5-48, and IGLC7), included non-synonymous changes. Notably, the novel allele identified at IGHV5-48 included a nonsense mutation that introduced a premature stop codon in the framework 3 region of the protein; 15 additional SNPs were also characterized within the exons of this gene. Prior to this study, only a single allele of IGLV5-48 had been described, classified as an ORF due to an uncharacteristic single nucleotide difference in the heptamer portion of the recombination signal (RS: TACAGT instead of CACAGTG 24 ). SNPs characterized in the remaining four novel functional/ORF alleles were represented in the 1000 genomes project (1KG) dataset 25 . Previously described regulatory motifs 13 , including RS sequences, associated with each of the 37 identified functional/ORF IGLV genes were also inspected for previously uncharacterized variants in the CH17 haplotype, but no SNPs in these regions were identified.Eight BAC clones were analyzed in the IGK locus, forming two independent contigs, one in the proximal region totalling 644 Kbp, and a second in the distal region of the locus totalling Table 2 ). We observed ten allelic differences at IGKV gene loci, and one allelic variant at IGKJ2; ten of these allelic variants, including IGKJ2*04, involved non-synonymous changes. We characterized nine novel alleles that were not represented in IMGT, including three that were observed in the Kawasaki haplotype. In two instances, we observed the presence of alleles that had been previously classified as either ""distal"" or ""proximal"" alleles residing at loci in the alternate location. For example, we found an allele that matched with 100% sequence identity to IGKV1-13*02 at the IGKV1D-13 locus in the CH17 haplotype, for which there had previously been only one allele described, IGKV1D-13*01. IGKV1D-13*01, which differs from IGKV1-13*02 by only a single nucleotide, was initially classified as an ORF due to an abnormal V-heptamer sequence, but was later identified in a productive rearrangement, indicating that it is likely functional 27 .Interestingly, from our analysis of regulatory elements, we found that the allele in the CH17 haplotype at this locus (IGKV1-13*02) was associated with a typical, non-mutated V-heptamer sequence. Thus, this functional V-heptamer variant may also be associated with IGKV1D-13 alleles (e.g., IGKV1D-13*01 noted above), and facilitate their expression.Discrepancies have also been noted regarding the functionality of IGKV1-8, for which only one coding allele is known. Genomic descriptions of this gene have revealed a 21 bp deletion in an upstream regulatory element, which had been predicted to disruption of promoter function and inhibit expression (mutation observed in the Kawasaki haplotype 28 ); however, IGKV1-8*01 has been shown to be expressed in some cases 27 . Potentially explaining this discrepancy, we found that the previously described IGKV1-8*01 21 bp promoter deletion was not present in the CH17 haplotype, suggesting that this germline indel variant could contribute to variation in the expression of alleles at this locus.

Characterization of structural variants in IGL and IGK CH17 haplotypes

A direct comparison of the IGL CH17 and Kawasaki haplotypes revealed the presence of only a single structural variant. This 11.9 Kbp insertion was located in the region between the psuedogenes IGLV7-35 and IGLV2-34 within the BAC, CH17-242N13; the region between these pseudogenes spans ~120 Kbp and is devoid of IG genes. Gene prediction analysis did not identify any genes within the insertion, nor did the insertion disrupt the non-IG related genes, ZNF280B, ZNF280A, and PRAME, located in this region; the breakpoints of the event occurred between ZNF280A and PRAME. No structural variants were observed in the IGK CH17 haplotype.We also searched the CH17 haplotypes for all IGL and IGK gene/allele sequences classified as ""not located"" in the IMGT database, meaning that these genes have not been located within IGL or IGK loci. Using this approach we mapped the pseudogene IGLV2-NL1 to the locus in CH17 corresponding to the position of the pseudogene IGLV2-34 in the Kawasaki haplotype;IGLV2-NL1 matched CH17 at this locus with 100% sequence identity, suggesting that IGLV2-NL1 and IGLV2-34 genes are allelic rather than distinct loci. No additional exact matches between the CH17 haplotype and other ""not-located"" V genes were observed.

Analysis of proximal and distal regions in CH17 and Kawasaki haplotypes reveals evidence for sequence exchange

Previous analysis of sequence similarity between shared homology blocks of proximal and distal segmental duplication units, which comprise the majority of the IGK locus, revealed that these two regions are >98% similar over most of the region 17 . Segmental duplications are known to facilitate sequence exchange via non-allelic homologous recombination and interlocus gene conversion 29, 30 ; however, given the lack of reference sequence data this has not been investigated in the IGK locus. To address this, we conducted pair-wise comparisons of distal and proximal regions from CH17 and Kawasaki haplotypes to search for large tracts of shared sequence ( Figure 3A ). The expectation is that sequence should be most similar between homologous regions in the alternate haplotype, whereas higher similarity between proximal and distal regions within a haplotype would suggest the occurrence of sequence exchange. Using this approach, we identified a large ~16.7 Kbp region that showed higher identity between the proximal and distal units of the Kawasaki haplotype than between the CH17 distal and Kawasaki proximal units ( Figure 3A ). This region included two IGKV genes for which we observed allelic variants between the Kawasaki and CH17 haplotypes. Four-way sequence alignments of this region show that the CH17 distal unit was most unique compared to the other three sequences The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/006866 doi: bioRxiv preprint haplotype. It is important to note, however, that the Kawasaki distal fragment harbors many unique bp differences compared to the other three sequences (blue tick marks, Figure 3B ), which could be suggestive of the occurrence of mutation following the predicted sequence exchange event. Further analysis of this multi-sequence alignment using the DSS method for recombination detection also predicted two potential flanking recombination breakpoints within the expected regions based on visual inspection of the sequence alignment and comparison of sequence similarities. We also analyzed sequence from two BAC clones in the proximal and distal clusters from the RPCI-11 BAC library 18 ; this analysis revealed that these carried the same variants observed in the Kawasaki haplotype.

SNP diversity and genomic features in IGHV, IGLV, and IGKV gene regions

Compared to the number of allelic variants observed between the IGHV CH17 haplotype and the reference genome (19 allelic variants/40 V gene loci 31 ), V gene allelic variation described in this study for IGL (6 allelic variants/37 V gene loci) and IGK (10 allelic variants/44 V gene loci) was noticeably lower. This prompted us to also compare other genomic characteristics between the three loci. Excluding regions of structural variation between haplotypes, we first generated SNP calls (not including gaps and single bp indels) between the CH17 and reference haplotypes for all three loci; 491, 1046, and 2897 SNPs were identified for IGKV, IGLV, and IGHV, respectively (Table 2; Figure 4 , left panel). After cross referencing these SNPs with dbSNP135 and 1KG datasets, 74, 110, and 407 SNPs in the IGKV, IGLV, and IGHV gene regions were determined to be novel variants, not represented in either dataset. Not surprisingly, given the number of SNPs in the 1KG datasets, fewer SNPs at each locus were represented in dbSNP ( Figure 4 ). We examined these sites in publicly available Illumina data generated from .

We identified 73/74, 103/110, and 406/407 sites in IGKV, IGLV, and IGHV, respectively, that are supported by the Illumina data. The discrepancies may represent sequencing errors. The novel SNPs for each region reported in GRCh37 coordinates are in Supplementary   Table 3 .Consistent with observations based on V gene allelic variation, SNP density in IGHV (0.0035) was approximately 3-fold higher than in IGLV (0.0012) and 6-fold higher than in IGKV (0.0006); SNP densities were slightly elevated within functional/ORF V genes in each region compared to the calculated locus-wide values ( Table 2 ). An analysis of genomic features in the three loci also showed that the fraction of each locus covered by repeat content was highest in IGHV, whereas that covered by SDs, not surprisingly was highest in IGKV (Table 2 ). However, when SDs associated with the IGKV proximal/distal duplication event were excluded, SD coverage in IGHV (37.7%) was found to be much higher than both of the light chain loci (IGLV, 24.6%; IGKV, 28.2%; Table 2 ). When only SDs exhibiting > 95% sequence identity were considered, this difference was even more striking (IGHV, 28.8%; IGLV, 12.9%; IGKV, 1.0%).Interestingly, in IGHV, SNP density was higher in regions of segmental duplication compared to regions not covered by SDs, especially true when considering only those regions covered by SDs with >95% sequence identity (Table 2) ; however, this difference was not found to be significant after permuting SD vs. non-SD region assignments and re-assessing SNP densities of 10,000 MCFDR samplings (P > 0.05). SNP density was also increased in segmentally duplicated regions of IGKV with >95% sequence identity compared to regions not covered by SDs, but again, this difference was not significant (P > 0.05)..

We found that mean SNP densities were ~2-fold higher in telomeric regions (within 3 Mbp = 0.001; 1 Mbp = 0.0009) when compared to centromeric regions (within 3 Mbp = 0.0005; 1 Mbp = 0.0004;Supplementary Figure 2A ). Interestingly, SNP density within 1 Mbp of the q arm telomere of chr14 harbouring IGHV (0.002) was higher than all other telomeric regions, >2-fold higher than the telomeric average (Supplementary Figure 2B) . In contrast, when CHM1 SNP densities within 3 Mbp of all telomeres were compared, the region on the q arm of ch14 (including both IGHV and non-IGHV sequence) no longer stands out, suggesting that IGHV may have some unique properties contributing to higher than average genetic diversity. To place this in the context of the analysis conducted within the IG regions above, we also found that the q arm of ch14 has the second highest overlap with SDs (34%; Supplementary Figure 3 ).

Discussion

We present data for the first haplotypes of the human IGL and IGK loci from the same haploid genome, representing only the second full-length references constructed for these regions to date. From the CH17 clones, 12 novel alleles were identified in the two loci, including four IGLV alleles, seven IGKV alleles, and one IGLC allele. Two recent assessments of IGK allelic variation --one of a public dataset of 435 expressed sequences 33 , and a second of deepsequenced antibody repertoires from four individuals 34 --concluded that, unlike IGH, IGK allelic datasets are likely to be mostly complete, as only two putative novel alleles were identified from these analyses 33 . IGHV and IGKV repertoire sequencing in a single individual also supports .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/006866 doi: bioRxiv preprint these observations, finding that nearly 25% of characterized alleles in IGHV were novel, compared to 0% in IGKV 35 . However, the fact that we identified 11 novel light chain V gene alleles from a single haploid genome implies that additional efforts to identify unreported alleles in IGL and IGK are warranted. Importantly, as noted previously in IGHV 7 , SNPs associated with novel alleles identified in IGL and IGK were present in the 1KG dataset, further supporting the notion that the 1KG dataset could serve as a useful resource for future investigations of IG gene diversity and the identification of novel polymorphisms. However, given the prevalence of segmental duplication in the IG loci, it will undoubtedly be essential to consider the impact of paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) when assessing 1KG SNP data in these regions, as complex and duplicated sequence structure are known to confound SNP characterization 36, 37 .In addition to novel allelic variants within IGL and IGK coding regions, variants involving regulatory elements of two IGKV genes (IGKV1-8 and IGKV1D-13) were also identified. In both cases, regulatory elements previously associated with alleles at these loci were predicted to inhibit their expression; however, the alleles described for these genes in the CH17 haplotype were associated with regulatory region variants that would be expected to exhibit normal gene expression. The importance of such polymorphisms is that they can result in variable levels of gene expression, including the loss of genes/alleles from expressed repertoires.In addition to those noted above, several other IGKV genes are also classified as ORF genes based on irregular regulatory sequence motifs 27 . Notably, IGKV2D-29*02, previously referred to as ""VA2c"", has a non-canonical V-heptamer, but has also been shown to occur in productive rearrangements; thus, like IGKV1-8 and IGKV1D-13 alleles described in CH17, the expression of IGKV2D-29*02 could be explained by a previously undescribed regulatory sequence variant.Interestingly, a third allele at the IGKV2D-29 locus, ""V2b"", has also been shown to have a .

Our first observation from this comparison was that the number of V gene allelic differences among the CH17 haplotypes was highest in IGHV. This finding is perhaps not surprising given that allelic richness is also known to be highest in IGHV based on available genetic data in the IMGT database. In addition, studies of substitution patterns in heavy and light chain V genes have also revealed evidence for increased diversity in IGHV compared to IGLV and IGKV 23, 39 . Strikingly, however, when we extended our comparison to include all SNPs within the three loci, we found that locus-wide genetic diversity was also much higher in IGHV, indicating that increased diversity in this locus is not limited to within V gene coding regions. IGHV SNP density is also higher than that observed for killer cell immunoglobulin-like The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/006866 doi: bioRxiv preprint IGKV gene duplications/deletions (e.g., IGKV1-5 and IGKV3-20) has also more recently been noted from expressed antibody repertoire data, although these await confirmation as germline polymorphisms 34 . Thus, in total, liberal estimates from the literature indicate that only 4-6 light chain functional/ORF V genes are known to occur in SVs, in stark contrast to ~29 in IGHV 7, 8 . In line with this difference, four V gene-containing SVs were identified in the CH17 IGHV haplotype compared to zero defined in IGLV and IGKV.Two factors suggest that the higher rate of SVs in IGH may be attributable to the increased fraction of the locus covered by segmentally duplicated sequences. First, segmental duplications are known to be associated with SVs genome-wide 42 , and second, duplications have been shown specifically to facilitate structural variation in IGH 7 . Segmental duplications and tandem repeats also mediate sequence exchange either through gene conversion or recombination, that can either result in the homogenization of paralogous sequences 29, 30, 43 , or in an increase in genetic diversity 44, 45 . Illustrating the latter of these two scenarios, we found that for IGHV, SNP density was highest in regions including segmental duplications, particularly those with >95% sequence identity with their paralogs; similar trends were not noted for SNP density estimates calculated within non-SD repeat regions (Table 2) . Importantly, SDs with >95% identity comprised nearly twice the fraction of IGHV sequence than IGLV sequence, which may in part explain the differences observed in SNP density between IGH and IGL. It is also worth noting that the difference in the fraction of SDs between IGH and the light chain regions would be greater if the 222 Kbp of novel sequence (comprised primarily of SDs) identified in IGH by our previous study 7 were also included. In addition to this, assessments of CHM1 SNP density across autosomal telomeres and centromeres revealed that the telomeric region on chr14 containing IGHV had both elevated levels of SNP diversity, and increased SD .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/006866 doi: bioRxiv preprint overlap, compared to analogous regions on other autosomes. This suggests that the genomic location of IGHV has also likely contributed to the increased genetic variation we observe in this locus compared to IGKV and IGLV.The distinct clustering and genomic partitioning of V gene families within the IGL locus, and the observation that, compared to IGH and IGK, there are fewer IGL orphans present in other regions of the genome, has prompted the suggestion that IGL genes have undergone less ""evolutionary shuffling"" 22 , which may be linked to lower levels of diversity in the locus 15 and would be consistent with the results presented here. In comparison to the other two loci, we found IGKV to have the lowest locus-wide SNP density, nearly 6-fold lower than that observed in IGHV. Due to the large inverted duplication of the proximal and distal regions, over 80% of the IGKV locus consists of SDs with >95% sequence identity. This suggests that, unlike in IGHV, SDs may be responsible for sequence homogenization rather than an increase in SNP diversity.The fact that we found evidence of a large tract of sequence exchange between the proximal and distal IGKV units lends support to this notion. However, fully understanding the relationship between segmental duplication and SNP density in the human IG regions will undoubtedly require further sequencing and comparisons of additional haplotypes. We must also acknowledge the potential for confounding effects related to the use of mosaic reference sequences for this comparison 13,17,31 , which were generated from multiple large insert libraries constructed from diploid tissues, in some cases of unknown ethnicity. Considering this, it is possible that a comparison of CH17 IG regions to references generated from individuals with different ethnic backgrounds could result in artifactual differences between loci. However, because our findings are supported by existing V gene allelic variation data at the population level, it seems unlikely that the difference in variability between loci is due to ethnic origin of the tissue.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/006866 doi: bioRxiv preprint If the difference in SNP density observed here between the IG V gene clusters is in fact genuine, it raises the question of whether increased genetic diversity in IGH has any functional consequences. Given that SNP density within V gene coding regions in the CH17 haplotype was also higher in IGH compared to IGL and IGK, it could be speculated that mechanisms associated with an increased number of polymorphisms locus-wide in IGHV, could by default, result in greater IGHV gene diversity and a more variable expressed antibody repertoire. Intriguingly, in natural antibodies, the IG heavy chains are considered to play a more prominent role in epitope binding than IG light chains, although this is primarily attributed to residues of the third complementary determining region (CDRH3) not encoded by IGHV gene segments 46

Sequencing of IGL and IGK regions from the CHORI-17 BAC library

BAC-end reads from the CHORI-17 hydatidiform mole BAC library mapping to the GRCh37 reference genome were used to identify and select clones within the two light chain regions. The IGL and IGK genes are located at distinct loci in the genome, 22q11.2 and 2p11.2, respectively 2,13,17,49-51 . Nine clones mapping to the IGL region, and eight clones mapping to IGK were picked for complete sequencing. As described in Watson et al 7 clones were shotgun sequenced using high quality capillary-based Sanger sequencing and assemblies were constructed and finished on a per clone basis. Fully assembled overlapping BAC clones were then used to create contiguous assemblies spanning the two IG light chain regions using SeqMan Pro (DNA Star, Lasergene, Wisconsin, USA).

Annotation of V, J, and C genes and regulatory regions from BAC clones

Sequences of all functional and open reading frame (ORF) C, J, and V genes (based on IMGT classification) were downloaded from IMGT and Vega databases (www.imgt.org, vega.sanger.ac.uk). All sequences were aligned to the completed contigs of each locus using SeqMan Pro, the positions of which were confirmed using BLAST 52 . Sequences corresponding to each of the mapped C, J, and V genes were extracted from the CH17 contigs, and alleles at each locus were assigned using IMGT V-QUEST 53, 54 . ""Novel"" alleles were defined as those not found in the IMGT database. To search for potential variants in previously characterized regulatory sequences, SNPs determined from alignments of the CH17 haplotype and references The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/006866 doi: bioRxiv preprint from UCSC (www.genome.ucsc.edu), and SNP/gene region overlap was assessed using BEDTools version 2.1 55 . For those genes in which a SNP was found to occur within the defined regions, sequences in question from the CH17 and Kawasaki haplotypes were aligned, visually inspected, and compared to previously identified motifs.

Analyses of structural variants identified in CH17 IGL and IGK BAC clones

Using the program miropeats 56 CH17 contigs for IGK and IGL loci were compared individually to the sequences from the Kawasaki haplotypes (IGL, accession NG_000002.1;IGK-proximal/distal, accession NG_000834.1/NG_000833.1). The outputs for each comparison were visually inspected for potential regions of structural variation. Putative breakpoints for the single variant identified were determined by creating a multi-sequence alignment using sequences from the IGL Kawasaki haplotype and novel BAC clone that spanned the regions of the predicted variant-associated breakpoints. Multi-sequence alignments were generated and visualized in SeqMan Pro. Gene prediction was carried out using Genscan (genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html; 57 ), following by BLAST using the non-redundant gene database.

Comparisons of IGK proximal and distal sequence similarity and recombination analysis

For comparisons of proximal and distal V regions of the IGK locus from both the CH17 and Kawasaki haplotypes, only paralogous sequence shared between the proximal and distal regions were considered (i.e., sequence spanning the genes IGKV1-6, IGKV1-5, IGKV5-2, and IGKV4-1 was excluded, as these genes do have paralogous duplicates in the distal IGKV region).Base pair differences were collated based on pair-wise global alignments made between the Kawasaki proximal sequence and all other proximal and distal sequences from the Kawasaki and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

A sequence similarity plot was then generated for each pair-wise comparison using 10 kbp windows with a sliding size of 500 bp, as reported previously 17 . Sequences, ~22.5 kbp in length, from the region suspected to harbor a potential recombination event between proximal and distal regions, were extracted from each haplotype (proximal and distal) and aligned using ClustalW 59 within ebioX (http://www.ebioinformatics.org/ebiox/).

"Abstract

Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic 1 with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations. [2][3][4] Here, we compile new data on 936 local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 45% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies collectively have had significant effects slowing this growth, although policy actions in the US appear to be too recent to have a substantial impact since the magnitude of these effects grows over time. Our results suggest that similar policies may have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large and beneficial health outcomes. We estimate that, to date, current policies have already prevented or delayed on the order of eighty-million infections. These findings may help inform whether or when ongoing policies should be lifted or intensified, and they can support decision-making in the over 150 countries where COVID-19 has been detected but not yet achieved high infection rates. 5 2 .

","Introduction

The 2019 novel coronavirus 1 pandemic is forcing societies around the world to make consequential policy decisions with limited information. After containment of the initial outbreak failed, attention turned to implementing large-scale social policies designed to slow contagion of the virus, 6 with the ultimate goal of slowing the rate at which life-threatening cases emerge so as to not exceed the capacity of existing medical systems. In general, these policies aim to decrease opportunities for virus transmission by reducing contact among individuals within or between populations, such as by closing schools, limiting gatherings, and restricting mobility. Such actions are not expected to halt contagion completely, but instead are meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 to a manageable rate. These large-scale policies are developed using epidemiological simulations 2, 4, 7-17 and a small number of natural experiments in past epidemics. 18 However, the actual impacts of these policies on infection rates in the ongoing pandemic are unknown. Because the modern world has never experienced a pandemic from this pathogen, nor deployed anti-contagion policies of such scale and scope, it is crucial that direct measurements of policy impacts be used alongside numerical simulations in current decision-making.Populations in almost every country are now currently weighing whether, or when, the health benefits of anti-contagion policies are worth the costs they impose on society. For example, restrictions imposed on businesses are increasing unemployment, 19 travel bans are bankrupting airlines, 20 and school closures may have enduring impacts on affected students. 21 It is therefore not surprising that some populations hesitate before implementing such dramatic policies, particularly when these costs are visible while their health benefits -infections and deaths that would have occurred but instead were avoided or delayed -are unseen. Our objective is to measure this direct benefit; specifically, how much these policies slowed the growth rate of infections. We treat recently implemented policies as hundreds of different natural experiments proceeding in parallel. Our hope is to learn from the recent experience of six countries where the virus has advanced enough to trigger largescale policy actions, in part so that societies and decision-makers in the remaining 180+ countries can access this information immediately.Here we directly estimate the effects of local, regional, and national policies on the growth rate of infections across localities within China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the US (see Figure 1 and Appendix Table A1 ). We compile publicly available sub-national data on daily infection rates and the timing of policy deployments, including (1) travel restrictions, (2) social distancing through cancellation of events and suspensions of educational/commercial/religious activities, (3) quarantines and lockdowns, and (4) additional policies such as emergency declarations or expansions of paid sick leave, from the earliest available dates to the present (March 18, 2020; see complete descriptions in the Appendix). Because the pandemic is still in its early stages, populations in these countries remain almost entirely susceptible to COVID-19, causing the natural spread of infections 3 to exhibit almost perfect exponential growth. 7, 14, 22 The rate of this exponential growth may change daily and is determined by epidemiological factors, such as disease infectivity and contact networks, as well as policies that induce behavior changes. 7, 8, 22 We cannot experimentally manipulate policies ourselves, but because they are being deployed while the epidemic unfolds, we can measure their impact empirically. We examine how the growth rate of infections each day in a given locality changes in response to the collection of ongoing policies applied to that locality on that day.We employ well-established ""reduced-form"" econometric techniques 23, 24 commonly used to measure the effect of policies 25, 26 or other events (e.g., wars 27 or environmental changes 28 ) on economic growth rates. Similarly to early COVID-19 infections, economic output generally increases exponentially with a variable rate that can be affected by policy or other conditions. Unlike process-based epidemiological models, 7-9, 12, 22, 29, 30 the reduced-form statistical approach to inference that we apply does not require explicit prior information about fundamental epidemiological parameters or mechanisms, many of which remain unknown in the current pandemic. Rather, the collective influence of these factors is empirically recovered from the data without modeling their individual effects explicitly (see Methods). Prior work on influenza, 31 for example, has shown that such statistical approaches can provide important complementary information to process-based models.To construct the dependent variable, we transform location-specific, sub-national time-series of infections into first-differences of their natural logarithm, which is the per day growth rate of infections (see Methods). We use data from first-or second-level administrative units and data on active or cumulative cases, depending on availability (see Appendix Section 2). We then employ widely-used panel regression models 23, 24 to estimate how the daily growth rate of infections changes over time within a location when different combinations of large-scale social policies are enacted (see Methods). Our econometric approach accounts for differences in the baseline growth rate of infections across locations due to differences in demographics, socio-economic status, culture, or health systems across localities within a country; it accounts for systemic patterns in growth rates within countries unrelated to policy, such as the effect of the work-week; it is robust to systematic under-surveillance; and it accounts for changes in procedures to diagnose positive cases (see Methods and Appendix Section 2). The reduced-form statistical techniques we use are designed to measure the total magnitude of the effect of changes in policy, without attempting to explain the origin of baseline growth rates or the specific epidemiological mechanisms linking policy changes to infection growth rates (see Methods). Thus, this approach does not provide the important mechanistic insights generated by process-based models; however, it does effectively quantify the key policyrelevant relationships of interest using recent real-world data when fundamental epidemiological parameters are still uncertain.

Results

We estimate that in the absence of policy, early infection rates of COVID-19 grow 45% per day on average, implying a doubling time of approximately two days. Country-specific estimates range from 25.23% per day (p< 0.05) in China to 65.04% per day (p< 0.001) in Iran, although an estimate only using data from Wuhan, the only Chinese city where a meaningful quantity of pre-policy data is available, is 55% per day (p< 0.001). Growth rates in South Korea, Italy, France, and the US are very near the 45% average value (Figure 2A ). These estimated values differ from the observed growth rates because the latter are confounded by the effects of policy. In the early stages of most epidemics, a large proportion of the population remains susceptible to the virus, and if the spread of the virus is left uninhibited by policy or behavioral change, exponential growth will continue until the fraction of the susceptible population declines meaningfully. 7, 29 This decline results from members of the population leaving the transmission cycle, due to either recovery or death. 29 At the time of writing, the minimum susceptible population fraction in any of the administrative units analyzed is 99.4% of the total population (Lodi, Italy: 1,445 infections in a population of 230,000). This suggests that all administrative units in all six countries would likely be in a regime of uninhibited exponential growth if policies were removed today.Consistent with predictions from epidemiological models, 2, 18, 32 we find that the combined effect of all policies within each country reduces the growth rate of infections by a substantial and, except in the US, statistically significant amount ( Figure 2B ). For example, a locality in Italy with a baseline growth rate of 0.38 (national avg.) that deployed all policy actions used in Italy would be expected to lower its daily growth rate by 0.18 to 0.20. In general, the estimated total effects of policy packages are large enough that they can in principle offset a large fraction of, or even eliminate, the baseline growth rate of infections-although in several countries many localities are not currently deploying the full set of policies. Our estimate for the total growth effect of all US policies is quantitatively substantial (-0.25) but not statistically significant. US estimates are highly uncertain due to the short period of time for which data are available and because the time elapsed since these actions may be too short to observe a significant impact. In China, where policies have been enacted for over seven weeks, we observe that policy impacts have grown over time during the first three weeks of deployment (-0.11 to -0.33) . In all other countries except China, we only estimate an average effect for the entire interval of observation, due to the short temporal length of the sample.The estimates above describe the superposition of all policies deployed in each country, i.e. they represent, for each country, the average effect of policies on infection growth rates that we would expect to observe, if all policies enacted anywhere in the country were implemented simultaneously in a region of the country. We also estimate the effects of individual types of policies or clusters of policies that are grouped based on their similarity in goal (e.g., closing libraries and closing 5 . museums are grouped) or timing (e.g., policies that are generally deployed simultaneously in a certain country). In many cases, our estimates for these effects are statistically noisier than the estimates for all policies combined (presented above) because we are estimating multiple effects simultaneously. Thus, we are less confident in individual estimates and in their relative rankings. Estimated effects differ between countries, and policies are neither identical nor perfectly comparable in their implementation across countries or, in many cases, across different localities within the same country. Nonetheless, overall we estimate that almost all policies likely contribute to slowing the growth rate of infections (Figure 2c ), except two policies (social distancing in France and Italy) where point estimates are slightly positive, small in magnitude, and not statistically different from zero.We combine the estimates above with our data on the timing of hundreds of policy deployments to estimate the total effect to date of all policies in our sample. To do this, we use our estimates above to predict the growth rate of infections in each locality on each day given the policies in effect at that location on that date ( Figure 3 , blue markers). We then use the same model to predict what counterfactual growth rates would be on that date if all policies were removed ( Figure 3 , red), which we refer to as a ""no policy"" scenario. The difference between these two predictions is our estimated effect that all anti-contagion policies actually deployed had on the growth rate of infections on that date. We estimate that since the beginning of our sample, on average, all anti-contagion policies combined have slowed the average daily growth rate of infections −0.166 per day (±0.015, p < 0.001) in China, −0.276 (±0.066, p < 0.001) in South Korea, −0.158 (±0.071, p < 0.05) in Italy, −0.292 (±0.037, p < 0.001) in Iran, −0.132 (±0.053, p < 0.05) in France and −0.044 (±0.059, p = 0.45) in the US. Taken together, these results suggest that anti-contagion policies currently deployed in the first five countries are achieving their intended objective of slowing the pandemic, broadly confirming epidemiological simulations. We estimate that anti-contagion policies have not yet had a substantial nor significant impact suppressing overall infection growth rates in the US.At a particular moment in time, the total number of COVID-19 infections depends on the growth rate of infections on all prior days. Thus, persistent decreases in growth rates have a compounding effect on total infections, at least until a shrinking susceptible population slows growth through a different mechanism. To provide a sense of scale and context for our main results in Figures 2 and 3, we integrate the growth rate of infections in each locality from Figure 3 to estimate total infections to date, both with actual anti-contagion policies and in the ""no policy"" counterfactual scenario. To account for the declining size of the susceptible population in each administrative unit, we couple our econometric estimates for the effects of policies to a simple Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model of infectious disease dynamics 7, 22 (see Methods). This allows us to extend our projections beyond the initial exponential growth phase of infections, a threshold which our results suggest would currently be exceeded in several countries in the ""no policy"" scenario.Our results suggest that ongoing anti-contagion policies have already substantially reduced the 6 number of COVID-19 infections observed in the world today ( Figure 4 ). Our central estimates suggest there would be roughly 74-million more cumulative cases in China, 5-million more in South Korea, 1.2-million more in Italy, 2.6-million more in Iran, 650,000 more in France, and 20,000 more in the US had these countries never enacted any anti-contagion policies since the start of the pandemic. The relative magnitudes of these impacts partially reflects the intensity and extent of policy deployment (e.g. how many localities deployed policies) and the duration for which they have been applied. Several of these estimates are subject to large uncertainties (see intervals in Figure 4 ).

Discussion

Overall, our results indicate that large-scale anti-contagion policies are achieving their intended objective of slowing the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. Because infection rates in the countries we study would have initially followed rapid exponential growth had no policies been applied, our results suggest that these ongoing policies are currently providing large health benefits. For example, we estimate that there would be roughly 621× the current number of infections in South Korea, 36× in Italy, and 153× in Iran if large-scale policies had not been deployed during the early weeks of the pandemic. Consistent with process-based simulations of COVID-19 infections, 2, 4, 10-12, 14, 17, 29 our empirical analysis of existing policies indicates that seemingly small delays in policy deployment likely produce dramatically different health outcomes. While the quantity of currently available data poses challenges to our analysis, our aim is to use what limited data exist to estimate the first-order impacts of unprecedented policy actions in an ongoing global crisis. As more data become available, empirical research findings will become more precise and may capture more complex interactions. For example, this analysis does not account for potentially important interactions between populations in nearby localities, 7, 33 nor the structure of mobility networks. 3, 4, 10, 12, 17, 34 Nonetheless, we hope the results we are able to obtain at this early stage of the pandemic can support critical decision-making, both in the countries we study and in the other 150+ countries where COVID-19 infections have been reported.Based on our results from China, where the most post-policy time has elapsed and where a relatively uniform set of policies were imposed during a narrow window of time, it appears that roughly three weeks are required for policies to achieve their full effect. In other countries, these temporal dynamics are more difficult to disentangle with currently available data, in part because less post-policy data is available and also because countries continue to deploy new policies, making it more challenging to precisely measure the lagged effects of earlier policies. Future work should investigate these timing changes after more time has passed and new data become available.A key advantage of our reduced-form ""top down"" statistical approach is that it captures the real-world behavior of affected populations without requiring that we explicitly model all underlying 7 .

This property is useful in early stages of the current pandemic when many process-related parameters remain unknown. However, our results cannot and should not be interpreted as a substitute for process-based epidemiological models specifically designed to provide guidance in public health crises. Rather, our results complement existing models, for example, by helping to calibrate key model parameters. We believe both forward-looking simulations and backward-looking empirical evaluations should be used to inform decision-making.Here we have focused our analysis on large-scale social policies, specifically, to understand their impact on infection rate growth within a locality. However, contact tracing, international travel restrictions, and medical resource management, along with many other policy decisions, will play key roles in the global response to COVID-19. Our results do not speak to the efficacy of these other policies.Our analysis accounts for some known changes in the availability of testing for COVID-19 and changes in testing procedures; however, it is likely that other unobserved changes in patterns of testing could affect our results. For example, if growing awareness of COVID-19 caused an increasing fraction of infected individuals to be tested over time, then unadjusted infection growth rates later in our sample would be biased upwards. Because an increasing number of policies are active later in these samples as well, this bias would cause our current findings to understate the overall effectiveness of anti-contagion policies.It is also possible that changing public information during the period of our study has some unknown effect on our results. If individuals alter their behavior in response to new information unrelated to anti-contagion policies, such as news reports about COVID-19, this could alter the growth rate of infections and thus affect our estimates. Because the quantity of new information is increasing over time, if this information reduces infection growth rates, it would cause us to overstate the effectiveness of anti-contagion policies. We note, however, that if public information is increasing in response to policy actions, then it should be considered a pathway through which policies alter infection growth, not a form of bias. Investigating these potential effects is beyond the scope of this analysis, but it is an important topic for future investigations.Lastly, we note that the results presented here are not sufficient, on their own, to determine which anti-contagion policies are ideal for individual populations, nor whether the social costs of individual policies are larger or smaller than the social value of their health benefits. Computing a full value of health benefits also requires understanding how different growth rates of infections and total active infections affect mortality rates, as well as determining a social value for all of these impacts. Furthermore, this analysis does not quantify the sizable social costs of anti-contagion policies, a critical topic for future investigations.

Data Collection and Processing

We have provided a brief summary of our data collection processes here (see Appendix Section 2 for more details, including access dates). Epidemiological and policy data for each of the six countries in our sample were collected from a variety of in-country data sources, including government public health websites, regional newspaper articles, and Wikipedia crowd-sourced information. The available epidemiological and policy data varied across the six countries, and preference was given to collecting data at the most granular administrative unit level. The country-specific panel datasets are at the region level in France, the state level in the US, the province level in South Korea, Italy and Iran, and the city level in China. Below, we describe our data sources.China We acquired epidemiological data from an open source GitHub project 1 that scrapes time series data from Ding Xiang Yuan. We extended this dataset back in time to January 10 by manually collecting official daily statistics from the central and provincial (Hubei, Guangdong, and Zhejiang) Chinese government websites. We compiled policies by collecting data on the start dates of travel bans and lockdowns at the city-level from the ""2020 Hubei lockdowns"" Wikipedia page 2 , the Wuhan Coronavirus Timeline project on Github 3 , and various other news reports. As we suspect that most Chinese cities have been treated by at least one anti-contagion policy, due to their reported trends in infections, we have dropped cities where we cannot find a policy deployment date to avoid miscategorizing the policy status of cities.

South Korea

We manually collected and compiled the epidemiological dataset in South Korea, based on provincial government reports, policy briefings, and news articles. We compiled policy actions from press releases from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, local governments' websites, and news articles.Iran We used epidemiological data from the table ""New COVID-19 cases in Iran by province"" 4 in the ""2020 coronavirus pandemic in Iran"" Wikipedia article, which have been compiled from the data provided on the Iranian Ministry of Health website (in Persian). We relied on news media reporting and two timelines of pandemic events in Iran 5 6 to collate policy data.Italy We utilized epidemiological data from the GitHub repository 7 maintained by the Italian Department of Civil Protection (Dipartimento della Protezione Civile). For policies, we primarily relied on the English version of the COVID-19 dossier ""Chronology of main steps and legal acts taken by the Italian Government for the containment of the COVID-19 epidemiological emergency"" written by the Department of Civil Protection (Dipartimento della Protezione Civile) 8 .France We used the region-level epidemiological dataset provided by France's government website 9 and supplemented it with scraped number of confirmed cases by region on France's public health website, which is updated daily. 10 We obtained data on France's policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic from the French government website, 11 press releases from each regional public health site, 12 and Wikipedia 13 .We obtained data on South Korea's policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic from various news sources, as well as press releases from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and local governments' websites. The policy variables coded in the dataset are: "" business_closure, "" "" business_closure_opt, "" "" emergency_declaration, "" "" no_demonstration, "" "" religious_closure ,"" "" school_closure, "" "" social_distance_opt, "" "" travel_ban_intl_in_opt, "" "" travel_ban_intl_out_opt, "" and "" work_from_home_opt. ""The KCDC announced on February 28, 2020 that health-related public facilities were recommended to be closed; hence, the policy variable "" business_closure "" was coded as one from the announcement 60 date. Even though it was technically a recommendation, we did not code this policy as an optional 15 .

As a result, we coded the Level 2 alert due to into the dataset for the policy analysis.The policy variable "" work_from_home_optional "" indicates when KCDC began recommending that people work from home. On March 15, 2020, the KCDC press release stated: ""Since contact with confirmed cases in an enclosed space increases the possibility of transmission, it is recommended to work at home or adjust desk locations so as to keep a certain distance among people in the office. More detailed guidelines for local governments and high-risk working environments will be distributed soon."" 98

United States

We used state-level epidemiological data from the GitHub repository 14 associated with the interactive dashboard from Johns Hopkins University (JHU). For policy responses, we relied on a number of sources, including the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC), individual state health departments, as well as various press releases from county and city-level government or media outlets.Policy Data Policies in administrative units were coded as binary variables, where the policy is coded as either 1 (after the date that the policy was implemented, and before it is removed) or 0 otherwise, for the affected administrative units. There were instances when a policy implementation only affected a portion of the administrative units (e.g. half of the counties within the state). In an attempt to accurately represent the locality and impact of policy implementation, policy variables were weighted by the percentage of population within the administrative unit that was treated by the policy. The most recent estimates available of population data for countries' administrative units were used (see the Population Data section in the Appendix). Additionally, in order to standardize policy types across countries, we mapped country-specific policies to one of our broader policy categories used as variables in our analysis. In this exercise, we collected 130 policies for China, 37 for South Korea, 195 for Italy, 26 for Iran, 59 for France, and 498 for the United States (see Appendix Table A1 ).Epidemiological Data We collected information on cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative recoveries, cumulative deaths, active cases, and any changes to domestic COVID-19 testing regimes. For our regression analysis (Figure 2 ), we use active cases when they are available (for China and South Korea) and cumulative confirmed cases otherwise. We document quality control steps in detail in Appendix Section 2. Notably, for China and South Korea we acquire more granular data than the the data hosted on the John Hopkins University (JHU) interactive dashboard 15 ; we confirm that the number of confirmed cases closely match between the two data sources (see Appendix Figure A2 ). To conduct the econometric analysis, we merge the epidemiological and policy data to form a single data set for each country.We have collated a state level time series health outcome dataset in the United States from January 22, 2020 to present-day.The data comes from the Github repository associated with the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) interactive dashboard (Dong, Du & Gardner 2020, Lancet). As of the time of writing, the data are available here . The repository and dashboard are updated essentially in real-time; at least daily. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .To determine the testing regime, we used estimated daily counts of the cumulative number of tests conducted in every state, as aggregated by the largely crowdsourced effort named ""The Covid Tracking Project"" ( covidtracking.com ). We estimated the total number of tests as the sum of confirmed positive and negative cases. For some states and some days, there have been no negative case counts, in which case we utilize just the confirmed positive cases. We also ensured that the confirmed number of positive cases agreed with the counts in the JHU dataset.We programmatically filtered for possible testing regime changes by filtering for any consecutive days during which the testing rate increased at least 250% from one day to the next, and where this jump was an increase of at least 150 total tests over one day. After visually inspecting the candidates, we removed detected testing regime changes for North Carolina and Connecticut, as these states did not demonstrate spikes in their testing rate, but rather a more gradual and steady rate in the increase of testing.(NB: the last download from covidtracking.com was March 19, 19:30 PST. We have been updating the process and the removal of detected testing regime changes periodically, so this may change.)

Econometric analysis

Reduced-Form Approach The reduced-form econometric approach that we apply here is a ""top down"" approach that describes the behavior of aggregate outcomes y in data (here, infection rates). This approach can identify plausibly causal effects 23, 24 induced by exogenous changes in independent policy variables z (e.g. school closure) without explicitly describing all underlying mechanisms that link z to y and without observing intermediary variables x (e.g. behavior) that might link z to y nor other determinants of y unrelated to z (e.g. demographics), denoted w. Let f (·) describe a complex and unobserved process that generates infection rates y:Process-based epidemiological models aim to capture elements of f (·) explicitly, and then simulate how changes in z, x, or w affect y. This approach is particularly important and useful in forwardlooking simulations where future conditions are likely to be different than historical conditions. However, a challenge faced by this approach is that we may not know the full structure of f (·), for example if a pathogen is new and many key biological and societal parameters remain uncertain. Crucially, we may not know the effect that large-scale policy (z) will have on behavior (x(z)) or how this behavior change will affect infection rates (f (·)). Alternatively, one can differentiate Equation 1 with respect to the k th policy z k :which describes how changes in the policy affects infections through all N potential pathways mediated by x 1 , ..., x N . Usefully, Equation 2 does not depend on w. If we can observe y and z directly and estimate ∂y ∂z k with data, then intermediate variables x also need not be observed 15 https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

The reduced-form econometric approach 23, 24 thus attempts to measure ∂y ∂z k directly, exploiting exogenous variation in policies z.Model Active infections grow exponentially during the initial phase of an epidemic, when the proportion of immune individuals in a population is near zero.

"Abstract

Individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 . To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts.

","Introduction

In December 2019, Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. 1 It has since spread globally, reaching more than three dozen countries with over 80,000 confirmed cases by late February. 2 To reduce further spread of the disease, governments have implemented community measures to increase social distancing for those at highest risk of infection. 3 In China, policies include unprecedented lockdowns to reduce contacts between individuals, travel restrictions, and door-to-door temperature checks with mandatory mass quarantine. 4 Contact tracing, a core strategy to control disease, is used to identify individuals who may have been exposed to an infectious disease and to focus interventions on this high risk group. If identified contacts are symptomatic when found, they are promptly isolated and treated in a healthcare setting. More often, contacts are found healthy, and may or may not be infected. Depending on how much time has passed since exposure to the primary infected individual, those infected may not yet be symptomatic -this period of time between infection and symptoms is an important epidemiological trait of an infectious disease called the incubation period. How to handle these symptom-free contacts is a recurring point of confusion and controversy, particularly for emerging infectious diseases. Two essential strategies are used: individual quarantine and active monitoring. Individual quarantine involves the separation from others of an individual who is believed to be exposed to the disease, but not currently showing symptoms of it. A less restrictive intervention, active monitoring, involves assessing the individual for symptoms at regular intervals and, if symptoms are detected, promptly isolating the individual.The relationship between symptoms of a disease and infectiousness to others is critical to the success of containment strategies. Previous work has found that a disease's natural history, particularly the amount of transmission that occurs before symptom onset, greatly influences the ability to control outbreaks 5 and the relative effectiveness of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring. 6 Short-course diseases, such as influenza, and diseases with long periods of presymptomatic infectiousness, like hepatitis A, are impacted more strongly by quarantine than by active monitoring; however, quarantine is of limited benefit over active monitoring for the coronaviruses MERS and SARS, where persons usually show distinctive symptoms at or near the same time that they become infectious. Recent work on isolation for COVID-19 found a potentially large impact of perfect isolation, if one assumed there was limited presymptomatic transmission and a high probability of tracing contacts to be put under isolation immediately following symptom onset. 7 Our framework enables comparison of active monitoring and individual quarantine and considers parameters such as delays, and imperfect isolation to account for known nosocomial transmission of this respiratory virus. 8 One of the key uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 is the extent of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission. A recent study reporting asymptomatic transmission in Germany 9 was later found to be incorrect or misleading, 10 adding to the confusion. There has also been uncertainty about the serial interval -the time between symptom onset of infector-infectee pairs -which in turn reflects uncertainty about the extent of presymptomatic transmission. Early estimates by Nishiura et al 11 and Li et al 12 were derived from limited data (24 and 6 infector-infectee pairs, respectively) and in the latter case largely reflected the prior distribution derived from SARS cases in 2003. Given the severe impact of quarantine on both resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions quarantine can effectively control COVID-19, and among these under what conditions it is substantially more effective than less restrictive approaches such as active monitoring, particularly given uncertainty in essential disease parameters. Here, using methods described in previous work 6 and the latest epidemiological parameters reported for COVID-19, 11, 12 we compare the ability of individual quarantine and active monitoring to reduce the effective reproductive number ( ) of COVID-19 R e to below the critical threshold of one. While mass restrictions on movements within cities have been implemented during this outbreak and are sometimes referred to as quarantines, here we focus on the effectiveness of quarantine and active monitoring on an individual basis based on contact tracing.

Methods

We built upon a previously published approach 6 using recent estimates of transmission dynamics for COVID-19 to account for critical questions and parameter uncertainties. Reflecting the uncertainty surrounding key parameters for COVID-19, we compared two sets of serial interval parameters: 1) from Nishiura et al 11 with a mean serial interval of 4.8 days and 2) from Li et al 12 with a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (Table 2) .Briefly, individuals in a stochastic branching model progress through a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) disease process focused on the early stages of epidemic growth. Upon infection, individuals progress through a latent period before onset of infectiousness; during the duration of infectiousness, the relative infectiousness follows a triangular distribution. The time of symptom onset is measured as the difference between the incubation and latent periods, with negative values indicating presymptomatic infectiousness.During each hour of infectiousness, an individual can generate new infections following a negative binomial distribution with dispersion parameter k , with smaller values indicating more variability in infectiousness. Infectiousness while under individual quarantine (before symptom onset) and isolation (after symptom onset) can be reduced by a value between 0, indicating no reduction in the force of infectiousness, or 1, indicating no transmission during that hour. Upon isolation, an individual names a defined proportion of their contacts, who are traced within a defined number of hours and placed under either active monitoring or quarantine. Those under active monitoring are checked with a defined frequency, such as twice daily, and are promptly isolated if found to be symptomatic; however, prior to isolation, there is no reduction in infectiousness. A contact under individual quarantine has infectiousness reduced by a defined factor until onset of symptoms, at which time the contact is isolated.Using published values of the incubation period, the parameters for the maximum duration of infectiousness, time of peak infectiousness, and the time offset between the incubation and 3 . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . latent periods were fit using a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm, also known as particle filtering. 6 Particles with these three dimensions were resampled with an adaptive threshold to converge on a set of 2,000 that yielded simulated serial intervals that most closely match published values of the serial interval, as measured by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.As described previously, 6 two settings are defined with respect to the feasibility of interventions (Table 1) . A high feasibility setting, presented as the main results, is defined as one where 90% of contacts are traced and are put under either quarantine or active monitoring within half a day on average. Contacts under active monitoring are monitored twice per day on average. A contact under quarantine has infectiousness reduced by 75% until symptoms emerge and prompt isolation. When symptoms emerge in a contact under quarantine or active monitoring, they are isolated in a setting that reduces infectiousness by 90%. Assuming perfect intervention performance is not possible, the high feasibility parameters represent an upper-bound on the expected ability to implement interventions based on contact tracing. A low feasibility setting loosens these assumptions to account for imperfect recall of who may be exposed, delays in identifying or locating contacts, infrequent or untrained monitoring of symptoms, and imperfect isolation resulting in nosocomial or other infections.Unimpeded exponential epidemic growth driven by the basic reproductive number ( ) can be R 0 reduced by individual quarantine or active monitoring as measured by the effective reproductive number and , respectively. We present estimates of and under high and low R IQ R AM R IQ R AM feasibility settings. The difference is the number of secondary cases prevented by R AM − R IQ quarantining one infected individual over active monitoring for that individual. If the prevalence of infection among traced contacts subject to quarantine or active monitoring is p, then the number of traced contacts who must be quarantined to prevent one secondary case is .We calculate this quantity from the model under varying assumptions about p.The number of days an individual is under quarantine or active monitoring is measured as the time difference between when an individual is identified via contact tracing and when symptoms prompt isolation -which is immediate for an individual under quarantine and determined by the frequency of monitoring for an individual under active monitoring. We assume individuals under active monitoring or quarantine who are uninfected are followed for a duration of 14 days until clearance, consistent with recent interventions. 13 We calculated the expected percentage of infections that result from presymptomatic infectiousness in the absence of interventions as the sum total of expected secondary cases caused by an individual prior to symptom onset divided by the total force of infection for that individual times 100. This percentage equals 0% when symptom onset precedes infectiousness and equals 100% when the entire duration of infectiousness concludes prior to symptom onset.4 .

Results

We fit the model assuming short (mean of 4.8 days; scenario 1) versus long (mean of 7.5 days; scenario 2) serial interval estimates. Model fitting by SMC for serial interval scenario 1 (mean = 4.8 days) resulted in mean duration of infectiousness 2.4 days [95% CI 1.0, 6.7]; mean time of peak relative infectiousness at 43% of the duration of infectiousness [0%, 97%]; and a mean time of infectiousness onset 0.77 days before symptom onset [1.98 days before, 0.29 days after] (Table 2, Figure S1 ). The longer serial interval in scenario 2 (mean = 7.5 days) resulted in slower disease dynamics: mean duration of infectiousness 4.8 days [95% CI 1.12, 10.5]; mean time of peak relative infectiousness at 38% of the duration of infectiousness [0%, 97%]; and a mean time of infectiousness onset 0.51 days after symptom onset [0.77 days before, 1.50 after] (Table 2, Figure S2 ). Therefore, given the same incubation period distribution with mean = 5.2 days, a serial interval with mean = 4.8 days is best fit by substantial presymptomatic infectiousness (mean = 20.5% [0%, 91.4%]) while a longer serial interval with mean = 7.5 days is best fit by limited presymptomatic infectiousness (mean = 0.065% [0%, 0.88%]).Interventions based on contact tracing, unlike mass interventions such as travel restrictions and social distancing, are targeted at individuals and therefore require resources --material and personnel --proportional to the number of cases traced: contact tracing requires detailed interview of case patients to learn of contacts and public health outreach to trace them; active monitoring of contacts may include twice-daily visits by healthcare workers or phone-based self-monitoring; 14 and individual quarantine of contacts requires private space, provision of essentials, and investment in enforcement. The burden of implementing active monitoring or individual quarantine grows quickly as a function of disease incidence and the fraction of traced contacts who are not infected. Assuming uninfected contacts (who never develop symptoms) are monitored or quarantined for 14 days before clearance, the number of uninfected contacts followed grows more quickly than truly infected contacts ( Figure 1 ). As the ratio of uninfected:infected contacts traced increases from 1:1 to 9:1, for example, the burden of uninfected contacts grows proportionally; note the actual ratio may be closer to 2,318:1, as recorded during SARS control in Taiwan where 24 (0.04%) of 55,632 quarantined contacts were found to be truly infected. 15 Depending on the ratio of uninfected to infected contacts traced, individual quarantine, even if initially effective, may soon become infeasible as the epidemic grows, and will need to be supplemented or deprioritized to focus resources on other interventions such as social distancing.In locations at an early stage of COVID-19, where resources allow investment in high-quality implementation of interventions based on contact tracing, the effectiveness of individual quarantine or active monitoring depends heavily on i) aspects of the disease, especially the assumed serial interval and timing of presymptomatic transmission, and ii) aspects of the setting including the fraction of contacts traced. Briefly, a shorter serial interval, larger window of presymptomatic transmission, poor quality interventions, and a small fraction of contacts traced all reduce the ability of either intervention to decrease transmission. Unless otherwise noted, the following results focus on high feasibility settings.

The median reproductive number was 0.57 under individual quarantine and 1.55 under active monitoring in serial interval scenario 1 ( Figure 2 ) and 0.49 under individual quarantine and 0.54 under active monitoring, respectively, in scenario 2 ( Figure  3 ). For the shorter serial interval defining scenario 1, control ( ) was achieved only by R e < 1 individual quarantine in 84% of simulations, by either intervention in 12% of simulations, and in 4% of simulations neither active monitoring nor individual quarantine reduced in a high R e < 1 feasibility setting (Figure 2 ). The effectiveness of active monitoring is particularly sensitive to parameter sets with earlier onset of infectiousness relative to symptoms. When , for .2 R 0 = 2 example, remains below one unless the onset of infectiousness precedes symptoms by R IQ more than two days while has little tolerance for presymptomatic infectiousness (Figure 4) .

R AM

In a low feasibility setting, and remained above one, even with ( Figure 2 , 3).The fraction of contacts traced is a particularly influential consideration. As the probability of tracing an infected contact decreases, more cases are able to transmit the infection without isolation and therefore, there is a linear increase in the average or across the R IQ R AM population ( Figure 5 ). Even with other operational parameters reflecting a high feasibility setting, at least three-quarters of contacts need to be traced and quarantined to reduce in the R e < 1 population in the absence of other interventions. For those individuals who are traced and placed under active monitoring or individual quarantine, however, the impact of the interventions at reducing onward transmission by that person remains effective. Even if only a small proportion of infected contacts are traced, therefore, the transmission chains those contacts could create can be prevented. The extent to which it is worth investing in imperfect contact tracing will depend on the rate of epidemic growth, which affects feasibility, and the other mix of interventions being considered.In a setting where the COVID-19 case count continues to grow, resources may be prioritized for scalable community interventions such as social distancing; however, close contacts such as family members of a patient may still undergo targeted interventions. In our modeling framework, social distancing functions synergistically by reducing the reproductive number of infected individuals in the community who are not in quarantine or isolation. If social distancing reduces the reproductive number to 1.25 (e.g., 50% of person-to-person contact is removed in a setting where , active monitoring of 50% of contacts can result in overall outbreak .5) R 0 = 2 control (ie, ) ( Figure 6 ). Tracing 10%, 50%, or 90% of contacts on top of social distancing R e < 1 resulted in a median reduction in of 3.2%, 15% and 33%, respectively, for active monitoring R e and 5.8%, 32%, and 66%, respectively, for individual quarantine.Given the additional cost and burden of quarantine, it may be important to consider the marginal benefits of individual quarantine over active monitoring.

This value increases proportionally with the probability that a traced contact is not infected: 47 contacts need to be quarantined if 50% of contacts are infected; 468 if 5% of contacts are infected; and almost 54,000 if 0.04% of contacts are infected as observed for SARS control in Taiwan). 15 For the shorter serial interval scenario 1, the median incremental benefit of individual quarantine over active monitoring is much larger at 0.93, corresponding to a need to quarantine 1.1 infected contacts to prevent one secondary infection on average; though, if only 0.04% of traced contacts are infected, nearly 2,500 individuals need to be quarantined to prevent one secondary infection relative to active monitoring.

Discussion

To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, 16 we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically with social distancing.There may be such synergy in the data released by the WHO mission to China in February 2020. 17 In Guangdong, WHO reports that the proportion of fever clinic testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 declined from 0.47% on 30 January to 0.02% on 16 February, during a period of intensive social distancing interventions. 17 If one assumes that these social distancing interventions reduced transmission of nearly all infections that could cause attendance at a fever clinic, one might expect a lower total number of attendees, with proportionate declines in all infectious fever causes that are affected by social distancing. If one assumes that most fever causes are affected by social distancing, the declining proportion of SARS-CoV-2 among fever cases may reflect the benefits of interventions aimed specifically at this infection, which is to say case-based interventions like active monitoring, individual quarantine, and isolation.The effectiveness of individual quarantine versus active monitoring, targeted by contact tracing, heavily depends on the assumptions regarding the serial interval, the amount of transmission that occurs prior to symptom onset, and the feasibility setting. Under our fitted disease natural history parameters for serial interval scenario 1, with a shorter mean serial interval and hence substantial presymptomatic infectiousness, individual quarantine was considerably more effective than active monitoring at reducing onward transmission by an infected contact. To offset this relative benefit of individual quarantine compared to active monitoring, perverse incentives to avoid quarantine would have to be correspondingly larger. Both scenarios were fit using an incubation period with mean = 5.2 days among 451 lab-confirmed cases from Wuhan; 12 other recent estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 include a mean of 6.4 7 . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . days among 88 travelers 18 and a median of 4 days among 291 hospitalized study patients. 19 As a shorter incubation period relative to the serial interval would be consistent with less presymptomatic transmission, the incubation period distribution is a key parameter to refine as additional information becomes available.Under our fitted disease natural history parameters for serial interval scenario 2, with a mean serial interval of 7.5 days and hence a low amount of presymptomatic transmission, we found that both active monitoring and individual quarantine effectively reduced the expected number of secondary cases per contact below one. The incremental benefit of individual quarantine over active monitoring was minimal in this scenario, requiring hundreds or thousands of suspected contacts to be quarantined to avert one infection beyond active monitoring alone. These results suggest that with a serial interval similar to that of SARS for COVID-19, there are very few plausible conditions under which individual quarantine would offer a sufficient advantage over active monitoring to justify the substantial incremental resources required to implement individual quarantine and large incremental costs to those experiencing it. Furthermore, if the more restrictive policy of individual quarantine instead of active monitoring leads to a decrease in the percent of contacts traced, through hesitance to name contacts or avoidance of contact tracers, the small incremental benefit of individual quarantine over active monitoring in serial interval scenario 2 may cancel or invert.Under both serial interval scenarios, in a low feasibility setting, the reproductive number was rarely brought below one under either individual quarantine or active monitoring, though a median reduction in the reproductive number of 21.0% and 13.6%, respectively for serial interval scenario 2, can still meaningfully slow the growth of an epidemic; for serial interval scenario 1, active monitoring resulted in only a 3% reduction in the reproductive number while individual quarantine resulted in a 17% reduction. If the epidemic continues to grow, however, the feasibility and social acceptability of quarantining individuals becomes a crucial consideration. In these circumstances, complementary interventions such as social distancing and pharmaceutical interventions may be needed if efficient contact tracing and rapid isolation are not readily achievable, regardless of the extent of presymptomatic transmission.The findings of this study are limited by the reliability of the input parameters, which are inherently uncertain during the early stages of disease emergence. The model fitting procedure is tuned to accept a wide range of inputs consistent with the published dynamics without over-fitting -thereby allowing for built-in uncertainty of input values. Additional limitations of the model include the focus on early epidemic growth in the absence of depletion of susceptibles, the assumption of consistent across scenarios with different serial intervals, and an R 0 assumption of relative infectiousness following a triangular distribution and duration of infectiousness following a uniform distribution.The scope of this work compares individual quarantine and active monitoring targeted by contact tracing and does not simulate other approaches such as self-isolation or mass quarantine. In our model framework, self-isolation can be conceptualized as a scenario where 8 . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .all contacts are traced and under active monitoring, since symptom onset is the event that triggers, with some delay, isolation. Mass quarantine is expected to result in prompt isolation upon symptom onset of any truly infected individuals, but the impact of this strategy on COVID-19 will depend heavily on whether presymptomatic exposure within the group is decreased or increased by the approach to confinement. That is, mass quarantine may reduce or increase the number of uninfected contacts exposed to presymptomatic infectiousness of those who do go on to develop the disease. In serial interval scenario 1, where a mean of 20% of transmission is expected to occur before symptom onset, the positive effect of prompt isolation can be offset by an increase in presymptomatic transmission in a confined space. Mass quarantines can also result in unintended consequences that can exacerbate transmission of COVID-19 such as avoidance of contact tracers and inaccurate recall, or other infectious diseases more broadly, such as a reduction in healthcare worker support, availability of supplies, or high-density settings. 20 The impact of travel restrictions on human mobility, a necessary first step in the causal chain to outbreak containment, is difficult to measure, but the impact has been documented in Sierra Leone during the 2014-2016 epidemic of Ebola Virus Disease. 21 The conflicting conclusions from our two scenarios, driven largely by the differences in the extent of presymptomatic transmission, highlight the urgent need for more data to clarify key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19, particularly the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission, in order to inform response efforts. These highly influential parameters warrant further study to improve data-driven policy-making. In addition, our choice to consider shifts of the latent period relative to the infectious period implicitly assumes a similar shape to the underlying distributions, albeit with different means. As the amount of asymptomatic transmission will depend not only on the average timing of latent period relative to the incubation period, but also on the standard deviation of these distributions, more data on their true shapes is urgently needed.

Introduction. Bacterial infection is the leading cause of death in children globally. Clinical algorithms to identify children who are likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment remain suboptimal. Biomarkers that accurately identify serious bacterial infection (SBI) could improve diagnosis and clinical management. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) and neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) are neutrophil-derived biomarkers associated with bacterial infection. Methods: We evaluated LCN2 and MMP-8 as candidate biomarkers in 40 healthy controls and 151 febrile children categorised confirmed SBI, probable SBI, or viral infection. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 and MMP-8 to predict SBI was estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and compared to the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP). Results. Plasma LCN2 and MMP-8 concentration were predictive of SBI. The AUROC (95% CI) for LCN2, MMP8 and CRP to predict SBI was 0.88 (0.82-0.94); 0.80 (0.72-0.87) and 0.89 (0.84-0.94), respectively. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 in combination with CRP was significantly superior to either marker alone: AUROC 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96). Conclusion. LCN2 is a sensitive and specific predictor of SBI in children which could be used to improve clinical management and antimicrobial stewardship. LCN2 should be further evaluated in prospective clinical studies.Correspondence: ccasals@clinic.cat

Introduction. Bacterial infection remains the major infectious cause of death in children (1) . Identifying the small number of children with serious bacterial infection (SBI -microbiologically confirmed bacterial infection with systemic symptoms) amongst the majority with viral infections remains difficult, as clinical features are unreliable. Laboratory markers including white cell count, neutrophil proportion and C-reactive protein (CRP) have the strongest predictive value in children with clinically obvious SBI, rather than in the more numerous group with clinically uncertain infection status (2). Blood cultures, considered the gold standard for diagnosing SBI, are unhelpful for early antibiotic decisions as results are not immediately available, and are often negative if pre-admission antibiotics have been administered. In the UK there has been a 30% increase in hospital admission for children with probable infection (3), and the majority of children admitted with fever are discharged without a pathogen diagnosis. Many children with self-limiting viral illnesses are admitted to hospital and receive unnecessary antibiotics whilst awaiting the results of cultures, contributing Table 1 . Demographic and clinical data of recruited subjects. Table footnote: NS -not significant (P>0.05); IQR -interquartile range; N/A -not applicable; PICUpaediatric intensive care unit; WBC -white cell count; a Not all patients had samples collected for virological investigation; b Some patients had both respiratory and non-respiratory viruses detected. The identified bacterium is listed for patients with Definite Bacterial infection. Two age comparisons were significant: the Probable Bacterial median age was higher than the Definite Viral group (p<0.01), and the Definite Viral group were younger than the Controls (p<0.05). The proportion of children with male sex or with Caucasian ethnicity (mode ethnicity) was not significantly different between groups. Severity of illness, as indicated by the number of children requiring PICU admission, inotrope use and ventilation, was highest in the Definite Bacterial group and lowest in the Definite Viral group. Deaths in each group were not significantly different.to the spread of antibiotic resistance (4). There is an urgent need for new biomarkers that can reliably identify SBI. We identified lipocalin-2 (LCN2, neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin, NGAL) and neutrophil collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-8, MMP-8) as potential protein candidates to distinguish bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia in African children (5). Here, we validate the diagnostic performance of these markers in a cohort of UK children with confirmed, probable or possible SBI versus viral infection and healthy controls. tests. The study had approval of the St Mary's Research Ethics Committee (REC 09/H0712/58). Written, informed consent was obtained. Pathogen diagnosis. Bacterial diagnostics included culture of blood and (when clinically indicated) cerebrospinal and pleural fluid, and pneumococcal antigen detection in blood or urine. Respiratory or nasopharyngeal secretions were screened for viruses by nested PCR, including RSV, coronavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1-4, influenza A+B, bocavirus, metapneumovirus and rhinovirus. Patient categorisation and selection. Patients were assigned to clinical categories corresponding to likelihood of infection after evaluation of all clinical, radiological and laboratory data ( Figure 1 ). Patient categories were 'Definite Bacterial' (DB), 'Probable Bacterial' (PB), 'Uncertain Bacterial or Viral' (U), 'Probable Viral' (PV) or 'Definite Viral' (DV). DB children had microbiologically confirmed bacterial infection identified at a sterile-site, irrespective of the CRP value. As there were only 4 patients in the PV category, analysis was not carried out on this group. Controls (C) were recruited in out-patients. After categorising, patients were prioritised for biomarker estimation based on the quantity of available plasma, and the chronological order of recruitment to give 5 groups as follows: 42 (DB), 34 (PB), 33 (U), 42 (V), 40 (C). Biomarker measurement. Heparinised blood samples were kept at 4C pending plasma recovery by centrifugation and storage at -80C. LCN2 and MMP-8 were measured using commercially available immunoassays (RD Systems, UK) following manufacturer's instructions, by laboratory personnel blinded to the diagnostic group of each sample. Presence of visible haemolysis and the number of previous plasma freeze-thaw cycles prior to EIA had no systematic effect on measurement. The coefficient of variation for these measurements was 8.26% (calculated from 28 samples with 2 replicates). CRP and creatinine values contemporary with research blood sampling were obtained from hospital data for 156 children. CRP was measured by ELISA in controls (RD Systems, UK). Statistical analyses. Diagnostic performance of clinical markers was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves to compare the sensitivity and specificity of selected markers. Cut-off values were chosen based on highest sensitivity and specificity to predict outcome (Supplementary Table 1 ). The diagnostic performance of biomarkers was assessed by logistic regression, using LCN2, CRP and MMP-8 as independent variables and the condition to diagnose as the dependent variable. A Chi-square statistic was used to test for equality of the AU-ROC (Stata 11, Stata Corporation) (6). Laboratory measures and ages in each patient group were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests and Dunn's pairwise comparisons. Frequency variables including sex, ethnicity and severity of illness were compared using the Fisher Exact or Chi-square test of independence, using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc).Results. Patient groups. Table 1 shows the demographic features of the patient groups. Ethnicity and gender did not differ significantly. Children in the DV group were younger than those in PB and C groups, as expected for viral respiratory infection. The proportion of children with severe illness was higher in the DB than DV group. LCN2 and MMP-8 are associated with SBI. Concentrations of plasma LCN2 and MMP-8 were lowest in controls, and increased stepwise with likelihood of SBI (Table 1) . CRP, LCN2 and MMP-8 discriminated patients in the DB and DV or C groups ( Figure 2a ). We derived ROC curves for CRP, LCN2, MMP-8 for all 191 patients, and for neutrophil proportion and white cell counts in 175 patients with available values, based on the comparison of the DB group with the other febrile patients (combined PB, U and DV groups) (Figure 2b ). LCN2 used as a continuous variable predicted confirmed SBI with an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82-0.94), matching the AUROC for CRP (0.89 [95% CI: 0.84-0.94]). MMP-8, neutrophil proportion and white cell count predicted confirmed SBI less well than LCN2 and CRP (AUROC 0.80, 0.71 and 0.69 respectively) ( Figure 2b ). LCN2 performance is not confounded by creatinine concentration. As LCN2 levels increase with renal damage(7), we determined whether renal impairment influenced the diagnostic performance of LCN2. Creatinine levels contemporaneous with research bloods were available for 162 children (median and IQR: 39 and 34-50 µmol/L), and did not significantly differ between clinical groups (Kruskal-Wallis, P=0.36). The adjusted logistic regression analysis indicated that prediction of SBI by LCN2 was not affected by creatinine concentration (supplementary Table 1 ). Combination of LCN2 and CRP to predict SBI. CRP was used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of LCN2 to predict confirmed SBI in 191 patients with available CRP and LCN2 data. The AUROC of LCN2 and CRP were strongly associated with confirmed SBI. Both biomarkers were highly correlated (r = 0.40, P<0.001). However, when both proteins were included into a logistic regression model, the combination was significantly superior to either marker alone (AU-ROC 0.92 [95%CI: 0.88-0.96]) (Figure 3 and Supplementary  Table 1 ). LCN2 and CRP in uncertain cohorts. Without a sensitive gold-standard test for detection of SBI, the majority of SBI is 'missed', therefore we correlated LCN2 and CRP biomarker concentrations with clinical suspicion of SBI. There was a stepwise increase in biomarker concentration with increasing suspicion of SBI: from C, DV, U, PB, to B (Table 1, Figure  4 ). We derived cut-off values for LCN2 and CRP based on the concentration that showed the highest sensitivity and specificity to discriminate confirmed bacterial infection (DB) from other febrile patients (Supplementary Table 1 ). The sensitivity and specificity of LCN2 to predict DB were 83.3% and 82.5%. CRP had sensitivity and specificity of 85.7% and 83.8%. When the threshold value for LCN2 was applied to the other groups, there was a stepwise increase in prediction of SBI: 2 of 40 (5%) (C), 6 of 42 (14%) (DV), 9 of 33 (27%) (U), 15 of 34 (44%) (PB). The sensitivity and specificity of both markers combined (equal or greater than their 7th decile) was 90.4% and 86.5%. Children admitted with acute infection, sick enough to warrant blood tests, were recruited after presentation and before diagnostic studies were completed, at St Mary's Hospital, London and University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK. Detailed clinical and laboratory data were recorded. Healthy controls were recruited in out-patients. After excluding patients with proven or possible inflammatory conditions or mycobacterial disease, two independent paediatric infectious disease clinicians with access to all clinical and diagnostic data categorised patients as follows. Children with a clinical syndrome in keeping with SBI (sepsis with shock or severe focal infection) were categorised as 'Definite Bacterial' (DB) only if pathogenic bacteria were detected at a usually sterile site such as blood or CSF, and not including surface swabs, endotracheal secretions or bronchoalveolar lavage samples; otherwise these patients were categorised as 'Probable Bacterial' (PB). Children with a clinical syndrome in keeping with viral infection, not displaying any bacterial features were categorised as 'Definite Viral' (DV) if a matching virus was identified, or otherwise as 'Probable Viral' (PV). Children without detected sterile-site bacteria and with inconclusive clinical features of viral or bacterial infection were classified as 'Uncertains' (U). We set a threshold of 60mg/L for the maximum CRP as a minimum for inclusion into the PB group, or a maximum for inclusion in the PV and DV groups. Inclusion in the DB group was irrespective of CRP. Patients failing the CRP threshold were categorised as 'Uncertain' (U), alongside the other patients in this group with inconclusive clinical features. Controls (C) had no current or recent (previous two weeks) infectious symptoms or immunisations, and no identified or probable chronic infectious or inflammatory conditions. CRP: C-reactive protein. WCC: white cell count Discussion. This study shows that LCN2 is a sensitive and specific biomarker associated with SBI in children with febrile illness and has potential to guide antibiotic treatment decisions. The best diagnostic performance was achieved by combining LCN2 and CRP (AUROC of 0.92).LCN2 is a 21-kD glycoprotein secreted by neutrophils, hepatocytes and renal tubular cells and it is usually found at low concentration ( 20 ng/mL) in biological fluids (8). The role of LCN2 in the innate defence against bacterial infection has been attributed to its ability to interfere with bacterial iron uptake through competition with the bacterial siderophore enterobactin (9, 10). The role of LCN2 as a potential marker of bacterial infection as described in previous studies (5, 11). Similarly, LCN2 gene expression has been shown to discriminate bacterial from viral infection, with 22-fold increased expression in bacterial patients compared to controls (12) . Un- like CRP, the diagnostic performance of LCN2 is unaffected by age: LCN2 gene expression is central to an immunemetabolic network implicated in neonatal bacterial infection (13) . In comparison with CRP, LCN2 has a much shorter half-life (<20 minutes) (14) , rising more rapidly than CRP in a study in neonates (15) and responding more rapidly to successful antibiotic treatment (11) . Although a fast turnover is a desirable quality for a biomarker to monitor infection and treatment, it is also a diagnostic limitation when patients have received prior antibiotic treatment at the time of diagnosis. LCN2 has recently emerged as a biomarker of acute kidney injury (7). We investigated if the association of LCN2 with SBI was confounded by impaired renal function. Adjusting the analysis for creatinine concentration did not affect the diagnostic performance of LCN2 to predict SBI, which suggests that neutrophils are the likely source of LCN2. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 exceeded that of MMP-8, previously proposed as a paediatric sepsis biomarker (16) . In this study we have defined patient groups by a gradient from low-to high likelihood of SBI. This has the advantage to capture the real world situation in which the majority of patients have no definitively confirmed or excluded infection. The clinical group most likely to have SBI was defined by a positive blood culture (gold standard) and we used this variable as our predicted outcome to evaluate the diagnostic performance of LCN2 and MMP-8. Thus, it was not possible to compare diagnostic value of LCN2 to the gold standard; instead, we used CRP for comparison as the measurement of this biomarker to guide antibiotic treatment is commonly used in secondary and tertiary care. We have shown that the biomarker concentration of LCN2 and MMP-8 was proportional to the estimated likelihood of SBI, with unconfirmed patients tending to have intermediate levels (47% of PB group had LCN2 > 175.3 ng/mL threshold). We did not compare the levels of LCN2 or MMP-8 to CRP in the groups with diagnostic uncertainty, as this comparison would be confounded by the use of the CRP result to allocate the patients to clinical groups (PB, U, DV). Procalcitonin is a promising biomarker of bacterial infection with kinetics comparable to those of LCN2 and it shown a modest advantage over CRP in the prediction of SBI (17), but we did not have these data for comparison. Unless a biomarker is identified which discriminates SBI and non-SBI patients at non-overlapping concentrations, children with intermediate, 'grey' clinical markers of bacterial infection will remain as the group in whom the biomarkers are least effective, but most needed. The potential for LCN2 alone or in combination with CRP to improve the rapid identification of children with SBI at an early time, before culture results are available, could benefit clinical decision-making for children presenting with febrile illness, and improve antibiotic coverage in the easily missed minority of children with an SBI. The potential for LCN2 to improve antibiotic management decisions in febrile children should be evaluated in clinical trials.

"Abstract

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a pressing need for development of a prognostic tool that is easy for clinicians to use. Recently, a Lancet publication showed that in a cohort of 191 patients with COVID-19, age, SOFA score and D-dimer measurements were associated with mortality. No other publication involving prognostic factors or models has been identified to date.In our cohorts of 444 patients from two hospitals, SOFA scores were low in the majority of patients on admission. The relevance of D-dimer could not be verified, as it is not included in routine laboratory tests. In this study, we have established a multivariable clinical prediction model using a development cohort of 299 patients from one hospital. After backwards selection, four variables, including age, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase and SpO2 remained in the model to predict mortality. This has been validated internally and externally with a cohort of 145 patients from a different hospital. Discrimination of the model was excellent in both internal (c=0·89) and external (c=0·98) validation. Calibration plots showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed probabilities of mortality after recalibration of the model to account for underlying differences in the risk profile of the datasets.

","Summary

Background: COVID-19 pandemic has developed rapidly and the ability to stratify the most vulnerable patients is vital. However, routinely used severity scoring systems are often low on diagnosis, even in non-survivors. Therefore, clinical prediction models for mortality are urgently required.

Methods:

We developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model to predict inpatient mortality in COVID-19 positive patients using data collected retrospectively from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan (299 patients). External validation was conducted using a retrospective cohort from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan (145 patients). Nine variables commonly measured in these acute settings were considered for model development, including age, biomarkers and comorbidities. Backwards stepwise selection and bootstrap resampling were used for model development and internal validation. We assessed discrimination via the C statistic, and calibration using calibration-in-the-large, calibration slopes and plots. 4 demonstrated that the model is able to make reliable predictions in patients from different hospitals. In addition, these variables agree with pathological mechanisms and the model is easy to use in all types of clinical settings.

Implication of all the available evidence

After further external validation in different countries the model will enable better risk stratification and more targeted management of patients with COVID-19. With the nomogram, this model that is based on readily available parameters can help clinicians to stratify COVID-19 patients on diagnosis to use limited healthcare resources effectively and improve patient outcome.

Introduction

Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019 in China, there have been over 200,000 confirmed cases, with 10-20% developing severe COVID-19 and approximately 5% requiring intensive care 1, 2 . Although the number of daily cases has significantly reduced in China because of intensive control procedures, the numbers in the rest of world are continuing to increase. More than 10,000 deaths have been reported but the estimated mortality rate (3%) is much lower than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are not life-threatening, stratification of these patients becomes increasingly important as large populations are expected to be infected globally.The deaths and morbidity from COVID-19 infection are primarily due to respiratory failure, although a few people have died of multiple organ failure (MOF) or chronic comorbidities 4,5 .Therefore, reduced oxygen saturation is the major indicator of disease severity. However, symptoms at onset are relatively mild and a substantial proportion of patients have no obvious symptoms prior to the development of respiratory failure 4, 5 . Clinically, it is difficult to stratify patients who may develop lethal COVID-19 until respiratory failure develops. Since early identification and effective treatment can reduce mortality and morbidity as well as relieve resource shortages, there is an urgent need for effective prediction models to identify patients who are most likely to develop respiratory failure and poor outcomes.A robust, highly discriminatory and validated clinical prognosis model is required for stratification of these patients. Currently, very few reports propose reliable prediction models, which have been constructed using Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidance with internal and external validation 6 . One report based on a cohort of 191 COVID patients in early stages of the pandemic showed that age, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and D-dimer are independent risk factors of mortality 7 . However, D-dimer is not a routinely available clinical measurement and SOFA can be relatively low in COVID-19 patients on admission, but in the aforementioned report some patients in late stage of COVID-19 were transferred to its study hospitals 7 . This might explain the difference in SOFA scores.In this study, we aimed to employ routine, widely available clinical test data to predict mortality of COVID-19 hospitalised patients using multivariable regression analysis in a cohort of 299 cases. The model has been established and validated with a new cohort of 145 patients with COVID-19 from a different hospital. Through this study, we hope that the experience from the outbreak in China will assist the rest of the world in better stratification of COVID-19 patients to achieve better outcomes for patients.

Study design and patients

This was a retrospective observational study performed in officially designated treatment centers for confirmed patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan at the center of the outbreak in China.The protocol was approved by the local Institutional Ethics Committee (Approval Number: KY-2020-10.02). First cohort of 299 patients admitted in Tongji hospital within January and February 2020 were enrolled into this study for model development. Second cohort of 151 patients admitted to Jinyintan hospital who were included in a previous study were reused for model validation. All patients were diagnosed by positive tests of novel coronavirus nucleic acids (SARS-CoV-2), according to WHO interim guidance 8 . Only patients who were discharged from hospital or had died were included in this study. Six patients in the second cohort, who died very quickly after admission and did not received any laboratory testing, were excluded. Patients younger than 18 years of age were also excluded.

The time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was also recorded. SOFA was calculated within 24h of admission. For patients who did not have arterial blood gas analysis, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) to estimate the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) and the recorded fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) were used. The SOFA score for the respiratory system was calculated according to PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio when patients received non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients were closely followed until they died or were discharged from the hospital. Hospital mortality and length of hospital stay were also recorded.

Statistical analysis

Data were fully anonymized before data cleaning and analyses. We followed the TRIPOD guidance for development, validation and reporting of multivariable prediction models 6 .Analyses were performed in R version 3.5.1 9 . The development model was built using the data from Tongji Hospital. We performed logistic regression analysis with the outcome variable defined as mortality. Variables were selected a priori based on previous clinically-related studies, completeness across both sites, clinical knowledge and practicality of measurement in acute medical emergencies. Variables were excluded if they had high collinearity with global scores. The number of predictors was restricted based on the total number of outcomes in the development dataset 10 . Analysis was conducted for the following nine variables: age, hypertension, diabetes, SpO2, systolic blood pressure, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte count and platelet count. Organ-specific markers, such as alanine transaminase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were not included in the original development model because of collinearity with global markers, particularly LDH. SOFA score was not included for this reason, as explained in Results. D-dimer, interleukin (IL)-6 and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were excluded from the analysis because they were not routinely tested in the cohorts. LDH .

Albumin was selected as a marker for the acute phase response instead of C reactive protein (CRP) because of CRP collinearity with LDH. Age is known risk factor for mortality from severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19. Lymphocyte count and platelet counts were reported in a previous publication of COVID-19 and selected 7, 12 . In this study, lymphocyte count was log transformed due to extreme values. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diabetes and hypertension were selected based on previous publications 7 . All nine selected variables were input into the multivariable model and backwards stepwise selection was performed with improvement in goodness-of-fit assessed by a reduction in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A nomogram of the selected final model was used for graphical representation of the prediction model and was produced with R function regplotthis was chosen to offer maximum use of the prediction model in clinical practice without the need for internet access 13, 14 .Model performance was assessed via measures of discrimination and calibration. To assess discrimination, the C statistic was used. For calibration, patients in the development database were split into deciles, ordered by their probability of death. For each decile, the mean of the predicted probability of death was calculated and compared with the mean observed probability of death. Calibration plots were constructed including locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (loess) regression lines 15 .Internal validity was assessed with bootstrapping (1000 replications) of the entire model building process including backwards stepwise selection of all potential predictors. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The final multivariable model included age (adjusted OR 1·054; 95% CI 1·028 to 1·083), LDH (adjusted OR 1·004; 95% CI 1·002 to 1·006), log lymphocyte count (adjusted OR 0·296; 95% CI 0·148 to 0·541) and SpO2 (adjusted OR 0·897; 95% CI 0·831 to 0·958) ( Table 3 ). The final model showed excellent discrimination (C statistic = 0·89) and was well calibrated (slope =1 and calibration-in-the-large =0·00), as shown in the calibration plot (Table   4 and Figure 1 ). The final model for mortality is presented as a nomogram and an example of how to use the nomogram is presented for a patient aged 59, with LDH of 482, SpO2 of 85% and lymphocyte count of 0·64 ( Figure 2 ).The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 28.20045997 doi: medRxiv preprint low-risk individuals and under-estimation of risk in high-risk individuals. After recalibration of the intercept, the discrimination of the model was the same (as expected given that recalibration does not influence the ranking of individuals according to the model) as was the calibration slope. Calibration-in-the-large was 0·00 (-0·477 to 0·471). The calibration plots still suggest mis-calibration of the model (Figure 3c ). When both intercept and slope were recalibrated the calibration slope was 1·00 (0·675 to 1·477) and the plot then demonstrated good calibration (Figure 3d ).The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 28.20045997 doi: medRxiv preprint of the final model after optimization can be used by clinicians to give a prediction of mortality and thus inform treatment choice and guide patient and family counselling.Old age is a major factor of mortality from infection 21 . This is consistent with the current data from China on COVID-19 with less than 1% in children <10 years old, increasing to 2%, 4% and 10% in age 11-40, 41-70, and >70, respectively. However, the majority of people infected are 30-70 years old (approximately 80% of the total cases), thereby making it difficult to stratify the majority of cases according to age. Patient comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, did not significantly contribute to the model, although mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with hypertension.The pathological feature of COVID-19 is mainly that of a viral pneumonia with alveolar oedema and blockage of small bronchi to compromise gas exchange within the lungs.Therefore, PaO2 will drop when severe pneumonia develops. Since arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is an invasive and complex process, which requires arterial blood taking and use of a ABG analyzer, SpO2 measurement is much more used for continuous analysis of blood oxygen saturation in patients to estimate the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) 22 . Moreover, many mobile phone brands contain built-in sensors and SpO2 can be measured by patients themselves.In our cohorts, many patients had no blood gas data and therefore SpO2 was used as a variable in our model. Although SpO2 is not as accurate as PaO2 in critical illnesses, it could give the first indication of compromised lung gas exchange in the early stages of COVID-19, which would then be verified by ABG measurement upon admission to hospital.The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 28.20045997 doi: medRxiv preprint on admission, indicating that extensive lymphocyte death occurred following infection. LDH is released into circulation after cell injury or death 27 and serves as an index of the extent of cellular damage by the virus or the host immune response 28 .This study has several limitations. At this stage in the global outbreak of COVID-19, no published studies have developed and validated prediction models for assessing the probability of mortality in hospitalized patients. A most recent report proposed SOFA score, age and Ddimers as the important prognostic markers 7 . However, in our cohorts, the SOFA score was very low although there is statistical difference between survivors and non-survivors. This difference may be due to some patients being treated in other hospitals prior to transfer in the previously reported study 7 . In addition, SOFA score relies on blood gas analysis, which cannot be easily done continually, in clinics and in under-resourced settings, thus making it difficult for clinicians to use readily. In addition, since D-dimer is not routinely requested, too many patients in our cohorts had no test performed, making it is difficult for us to verify published results. Organ-specific injury markers were not included in the model, including cTnI due to missing data (not routinely measured), as well as ALT and BUN due to high co-linearity with other variables within the model. Therefore, the choice of potential prognostic factors could not be informed by a systematic review of existing prediction models. Similarly, there are no published estimates of discrimination and calibration to compare this study to. Additionally, the event rate is limited, especially in the independent dataset where at least 100 events would be preferable 29 . A multicenter study with a larger cohort for model development and also for validation would add more power, reduce bias, and make the findings more generically applicable.There is also inherent bias in the recruitment of patients because the Jinyintan hospital was the first officially designated receiving hospital in Wuhan for all COVID-19 cases at the start of the outbreak. The recruited patients were mainly self-referrals, but some were referred by other .

Self-referred patients are more likely to have severe symptoms that cause them to seek emergency medical help. Likewise, other hospitals are more likely to test patients who have more pronounced symptoms, thus creating an inherent bias in the patient sample. Therefore, the cohort may not accurately represent patients with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. These results need to be further validated with patients who are hospitalized for different severities of illness. In conclusion, traditional early warning scores and organ injury markers do not help to predict severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Here, we have developed and validated a clinical prediction model using readily available clinical markers which is able to accurately predict mortality in people with COVID-19. This model can therefore be used in current pandemic regions to identify patients who are at risk of severe disease at an early enough stage to initialize intensive supportive treatment and to guide discussions between clinicians, patients and families.

Patient cohorts

The development cohort included 299 patients who were admitted in Tongji Hospital. Data completeness is presented in supplementary Table 1 . There were 155 deaths, the median age of patients was 65 years (IQR: 54-73) and 48·2% were male ( Table 1 ). The validation cohort that included 145 patients was younger: age 56 years (IQR 47-68) with a higher percentage of males (65·5%) than in the developmental cohort (P<0·001). The median (IQR) time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was no different in the developmental 10 [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] and validation 10 [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] cohorts. More patients had hypertension (42·6% vs 26·9%) and heart failure (4·4% vs 0.7%) in the development than validation cohorts, whilst diabetes (18·5% vs 11·7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (5·0% vs 3·4%) and others (6·4% vs 4·8) showed no statistical difference. SOFA scores were statistically higher in the development than validation cohorts (2·0 [2·0-4·0] vs 1·0 [0·0-3·0]) but both were very low compared to common critical illnesses. Table 2 shows that non-survivors were significantly older than survivors (69 years (IQR 61·75 to 75·00) vs. 52·50 (IQR 43·75-64·00), p<0·001). Patients with hypertension, showed a significantly higher mortality rate (p<0·001).

Internal validation

Interval validation was run using bootstrap resampling and showed a small amount of overfitting. Bootstrapping with backwards stepwise selection provided a shrinkage factor of 0.900. After adjusting for overfitting the final model retained high discrimination (C statistic= 0·880) and calibration-in-the-large of 0·006 (Table 4 ). The shrinkage factor was applied to the β coefficients of the multivariable model to provide optimism adjusted coefficients (Table 3) .

External validation

External validation is required because the accuracy of a predictive model will always be high if it is validated on the development cohort used to generate the model 16, 17 . In this study, we applied our final prediction model with optimism adjusted coefficients to the validation dataset.There were 145 patients in the validation dataset of whom 69 patients (47·6%) died. Of the 145 patients, 127 had complete data for the four variables in the final developmental model (age, lymphocyte count, SpO2 and LDH) The C statistic for the discrimination of the developed model in the independent data was 0·980 (0·958 to 1·000) and the model had reasonable calibration (slope and calibration-in-the-large) ( Table 5 ).

"Abstract

However, prevalence data are scarce in migrant populations.This study aims at evaluating the prevalence of S. stercoralis at hospital level in migrant populations or long term travellers being attended in out-patient and in-patient units as part of a systematic screening implemented in 6 Spanish hospitals. A cross-sectional study was conducted and systematic screening for S. stercoralis infection using serological tests was offered to all eligible participants. The overall seroprevalence of S. stercoralis was 9.04% (95% confidence interval[95%CI] 7.76 -10.31). The seroprevalence of people with a risk of infection acquired in Africa and Latin America was 9.35% (95%CI 7.01-11.69), 9.22% (7.5-10.93), respectively. The number of individuals coming from Asian countries was significantly smaller and the overall prevalence in these countries was 2.9% (95%CI -0.3; -6.2). There was only one case (1/14 (7.14%) from an individual from East European countries. The seroprevalence in units attending potentially immunosuppressed patients was significantly lower (5.64%) compared with the seroprevalence in other units of the hospital (10.20%) or Tropical diseases units (13.33%) (p<0.001). Conclusions: We report a hospital-based systematic screening of strongyloidiasis with a seroprevalence of almost 10% in a mobile population coming from endemic areas suggesting the need of implementing strongyloidiasis screening in hospitalized patients coming from endemic areas, particularly if they are at risk of immunosuppression.Strongyloidiasis is an infection caused by the helminth Strongyloides stercoralis which is ubiquitous in tropical and subtropical areas. In the rest of the countries, it is also frequent in migrants coming from tropical and subtropical areas. The disease is more severe when an infected subject has an impaired immune system. Within this study we have evaluated the prevalence of this infection in people being attended in six Spanish hospitals. The prevalence was around 9%, being higher in Africa and Latin America compared with other regions. In addition, the prevalence in patients with an impaired immune system (immunosuppression) was lower compared with people non suffering immunosuppression. These results suggest that the prevalence of strongyloidiasis is quite high among migrants living in Spain and that a screening programme should be designed, particularly in immunosuppressed patients that are at more risk of suffering severe complications of the infection.

Author summary

Strongyloidiasis is an infection caused by the helminth Strongyloides stercoralis which is ubiquitous in tropical and subtropical areas. In the rest of the countries, it is also frequent in migrants coming from tropical and subtropical areas. The disease is more severe when an infected subject has an impaired immune system. Within this study we have evaluated the prevalence of this infection in people being attended in six Spanish hospitals. The prevalence was around 9%, being higher in Africa and Latin America compared with other regions. In addition, the prevalence in patients with an impaired immune system (immunosuppression) was lower compared with people non suffering immunosuppression. These results suggest that the prevalence of strongyloidiasis is quite high among migrants living in Spain and that a screening programme should be designed, particularly in immunosuppressed patients that are at more risk of suffering severe complications of the infection. public health impact in non-endemic countries that are hosting these populations [1, 2] . The infection is ubiquitous in tropical and subtropical areas although it may also occur in temperate countries with the appropriate conditions such as certain areas of Spain or Italy [3] [4] [5] . Worldwide estimates based on standard faecal techniques have suggested that between 30 and 100 million people worldwide are infected. These figures may be underestimated due to the low sensitivity of the traditional diagnostic methods [1, 6] .Unlike other parasitic infections, this helminth has some characteristics that are of particular importance for migrant populations [7] . In the first place, the infection can persist the whole lifetime due to its ability to replicate in the human host [8] . Therefore, people coming from endemic areas may be at risk their whole life irrespective of the moment they arrive to a nonendemic area as long as they are not treated. Second, Strongyloides stercoralis infection is generally asymptomatic or causes unspecific symptoms, being unnoticed for health professionals not looking for it [9] . Third, although the infection is rarely transmitted through person to person, [10] it can be transmitted through organ transplantation, and autochthonous cases have been reported in nonendemic areas [11] . Thus, screening should be considered in potential donors at risk of the infection [12] [13] [14] . Finally, in case of immunosuppression, particularly described with the concomitant use of steroids, transplant recipients or patients with malignancies and Human T-Cell Lymphotropic virus-1 co-infections, the parasite may enter into a high replicating cycle (called hyperinfection) or disseminate to vital organs (disseminated strongyloidiasis), causing a severe disease with high mortality [15] . In this regard, immunosuppression permit larval proliferation (hyperinfection disease) and also dissemination to other organs (disseminated Strongyloides) [15] . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/852558 doi: bioRxiv preprintThe diagnosis of strongyloidiasis in non-endemic areas where re-infection is unlikely is currently based on a serological test which has considerably higher sensitivity compared with standard faecal techniques [8] . Despite having cross-reactions with other helminthic infections, this fact is less likely to occur in migrant populations since the possibility of co-infections is lower [16] and therefore it is nowadays the current recommended screening technique in these populations [17] . The sensitivity of the serological tests in immunosuppressed individuals seems to be lower [18] ; but these are limited data and further prospective studies should better evaluate the accuracy of the serological tests in immunosuppressed patients.Even with the limitations of current diagnostic methods, screening of high-risk groups and treatment of infected individuals is of key importance. In this regard, screening of strongyloidiasis in newly arrived migrants has been recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [19, 20] , particularly in immunosuppressed individuals, given the potential individual morbidity and mortality [16] .Evidence of prevalence of strongyloidiasis in migrant populations is scarce although it is known to vary substantially depending on the country of origin, being particularly high in countries such as Cambodia (36%) or Latin American countries (26%) [21] . Hospital-based prevalence studies conducted all of them in specialized units suggest prevalence of S. stercoralis between 4.5 and 11% in migrant populations [22] [23] [24] .Available data suggests a higher prevalence of the infection in immunosuppressed individuals at risk [25] [26] [27] .Our study aims at evaluating the prevalence of S. stercoralis at hospital level in migrant populations or long term travellers being attended in out-patient and in-patient units as part of the systematic screening implemented in 6 Spanish hospitals.

Study population, data collection and patient management

This is a cross-sectional study, carried out as part of a hospital-based prospective cohort study conducted in 6 referent hospitals in Spain (Hospital Clinic, Hospital del Mar, Hospital Universitari Bellvitge, Hospital Sant Pau and Hospital Vall d'Hebron located in Barcelona and Hospital de Poniente in Almeria province) aimed to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors associated with Strongyloides stercoralis infection, particularly related to immunosuppressed patients.Although a systematic screening has not been widely implemented at national level, it was established that individuals either hospitalized or being attended in any specialized out-patient or in-patient unit of the hospital should be screened for strongyloidiasis. Not all hospital units or department were participating in the study. In particular, infectious diseases or Tropical unit and units attending severe immunosuppressed patients were willing to participate and to implement the systematic screening.Migrant adult individuals or adult long-term travellers (defined as those staying one year or more in any endemic country) were systematically offered being screened for Strongyloides stercoralis based on a serological test. Endemic countries were considered any country in Asia, Oceania, Africa, East European countries or Latin American countries. Therefore, inclusion criteria were to have reside in an endemic country for one more than year and to be attended in the hospital for any reason and irrespective of the level of immunosuppression.As part of this programme, all individuals who met inclusion criteria for screening were offered to be tested for S. stercoralis infection through a serological blood test.All positive patients were invited to participate and signed the consent form and were provided treatment with ivermectin 200 mcg/kg during 2 consecutive days. Participants were clinically and microbiologically followed -up after six months of therapy as part of the routine clinical practice.

A single ELISA test was used (Strongyloidiasis ELISA Kit based on IVD Strongyloides stercoralis crude antigen). To reduce the inter-laboratory variability, an internal workshop was carried out before starting the study to standardized the serological techniques and also the interpretation of the results. Positive samples are defined by absorbance greater than 0.2 OD units. The absorbance of study sample/0.2>=1 (calculated value) was used as the cut-off.

Sample size estimation.

Based on other seroprevalence studies conducted in non-endemic areas, we estimated a prevalence of S. stercoralis of 11% for our cohort [17] . Based on these data, it was estimated to screen 1700 individuals during 24 months to recruit 150 cases of strongyloidiasis, considering an Alfa error of 5% and a lost to follow-up of 10%.

Statistical analysis

Categorical variables were described using a frequency distribution and the median and the interquartile range were used to describe age. Countries of origin were subsequently grouped into different geographic areas according to the criteria that could more precisely identify the migration patterns. The GeoSentinel geographic area distribution was selected [28] . Prevalence point estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were obtained. We used Fisher's exact test to compare percentages. Data were managed and analysed using STATA 13. We built a world map with country of acquisition's prevalence using the free software QGIS, version 2. 18 The study has been reported following the STROBE statement (Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology) for reporting observational studies (Annex 1). Women had a higher seroprevalence (10.77%) compared with men (6.96%) (p-value = 0.005).

We found no association between the age group and the prevalence (p= 0.962).

Seroprevalence by geographic distribution

The seroprevalence of people with a risk of infection acquired in Africa was 9.35 (95%CI 7.01- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/852558 doi: bioRxiv preprintThe number of individuals screened coming from Asian countries was significantly smaller and the overall prevalence in these countries was 2.9% (95%CI -0.3, 6.2). Only 3 cases were observed, in people coming from South-East Asia (11.11%; 95%CI 1.5-23.78) and all 3 were originally from Philippines (seroprevalence 13.63%).There was only one case (1/14 (7.14%) from an individual from East European countries. The patient was from Montenegro and he had not travelled outside Europe.There were 50 individuals originally from West Europe that were also screened for S.stercoralis after long term travels to endemic countries. In the 3 out of 50 individuals (5.6%) with a positive result, the country of acquisition could not be identified since all of them had undertaken trips to several endemic areas in the past (Latin America and South East Asia countries).

Seroprevalence by screening department

The seroprevalence in units attending immunosuppressed and potentially immunosuppressed In these units, the rate in individual with a LA origin was 3.74% and 3.39% respectively, significantly lower compared with other units.

Discussion

Our study shows an overall prevalence of almost 10% which is consistent with other studies conducted in migrant population living in non-endemic areas [17] . This is one of the first studies evaluating the results of a systematic screening in potentially immunosuppressed patients in which the disease may be more severe. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/852558 doi: bioRxiv preprintThe high prevalence found in our study supports the need of screening strategies in patients that are potentially immunosuppressed particularly for Sub-Saharan African and Latin American migrants.Potentially immunosuppressed people are at higher risk of developing a severe complication of the disease as it has been extensively reported elsewhere [15] . However, the probability of developing hyperinfection or dissemination of the infection in the high-risk immunosuppressed population is unclear. Systematic screening has been recently recommended in high-risk population coming from endemic areas [19] . However, few programmes have reported their results so far. In this regard, a reference centre in Austria has initiated screening of S.stercoralis to all transplant recipients showing 3% prevalence even though only a small percentage were migrants and most of them from East European countries [29] .Interestingly, the seroprevalence in Ecuador and also in Bolivia was much higher compared with other LA countries but similar compared with other studies conducted in migrants from these countries [30] , which may be partially explained due the profile of migrants coming from rural areas in these countries. In addition, the sampling in these countries may have been also overrepresented compared to other LA countries and therefore the prevalence in LA may be overestimated.In other geographic areas, such South-East Asia or North Africa, our data show a not negligible rate with seroprevalence higher than 5% in countries such as Morocco or Philippines. We have not found any other published seroprevalence data in such countries. Although the limited sampling may prevent to extract conclusion about the real prevalence in these countries, these data refute the need to consider them in the pool of countries where screening should be recommended.Data from Asian countries are still very scarce and the limited sampling may prevent to extract proper conclusions regarding the prevalence in this geographic area.

Further studies in non-endemic areas should better evaluate the S. stercoralis prevalence in people coming from Asian countries.Seroprevalence in women was found to be significantly higher compared to men which differ from other studies where the prevalence was more frequent in males [32] . In our population data-base some countries like Bolivia with a high seroprevalence have a larger proportion of women. This fact may have partially explained this difference.In our study, prevalence in HIV-infected individuals and transplant units was much lower compared with other general out/in-patients units services of the hospitals. One possible explanation that could have contributed to the lower prevalence found in potentially immunosuppressed patients, is that the serology has a lower sensitivity in immunosuppressed patients as it has been reported in other studies [18] .The sensitivity of the serology in immunosuppressed patients deserves further evaluation of its accuracy, since only few studies have evaluated it, showing a lower sensitivity compared to parasitological techniques [18] This is a hospital-based study and results should be interpreted in the context of a hospital-based population. Generalizing our prevalence results to the general (or wider) population should be done with caution since the positive selection bias should be taken into account. In addition, another limitation is the difference of the prevalence between the hospitals participating in this study that could be partially explained by differences in the migrant profile. However, a lack of systematic screening could have overestimated the prevalence in some cases.

Conclusions

We report a hospital-based systematic screening of Strongyloides with a seroprevalence of almost 10% in migrant population from endemic areas what put in evidence the need of implementing strongyloidiasis screening strategies in hospitalized patients, particularly if they are at more risk of immunosuppression.

"Abstract

Purpose: COVID-19 has become global threaten. CT acts as an important method of 60 diagnosis. However, human-based interpretation of CT imaging is time consuming. 61More than that, substantial inter-observer-variation cannot be ignored. We aim at 62 developing a diagnostic tool for artificial intelligence (AI)-based classification of CT 63 images for recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung. 64 Experimental Design: In this study, images were retrospectively collected and 65 prospectively analyzed using machine learning. CT scan images of the lung that show 66 or do not show COVID-19 were used to train and validate a classification framework 67 based on convolutional neural network. Five conditions including COVID-19 68 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary 69 tuberculosis, and normal lung were evaluated. Training and validation set of images 70 were collected from Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan Hospital whereas test set of images were 71 collected from Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University and the fifth Hospital of 72Wuhan. 73 Results: Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the AI framework were reported. For 74 test dataset, accuracies for recognizing normal lung, COVID-19 pneumonia, 75 non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis 76 were 99.4%, 98.8%, 98.5%, 98.3%, and 98.6%, respectively. For the test dataset, 77 accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of recognizing COVID-19 were 78 98.8%, 98.2%, 98.9%, 94.5%, and 99.7%, respectively. 79 All rights reserved.

. Although the upward trend of COVID-19 has been 94 effectively curbed, the number of confirmed cases has increased dramatically in 95 several countries, such as South Korea, Japan, Italy, and other countries. 96According to the WHO interim guidance (2) and series diagnosis and treatment scheme 97 for COVID-19 of China, confirmed case of COVID-19 was made on the basis of a 98 positive result on high-throughput sequencing or real-time 99 reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of specimen 100 collected by nasal and pharyngeal swab. However, the false negative rate of nucleic 101 acid detection may be relatively high in early stage of 102 repeated tests are needed to get positive results. Novel coronavirus that leads to 103 COVID-19 is encoded by RNA, which is a highly unstable and tends to be degraded 104 by RNAase. RNAase is widely found in saliva and surrounding environment.

Another 108 constraint in practice is that the supply of assay kits of nucleic acid detection may be 109 seriously inadequate in case of a large-scale outbreak of disease. In contrast, 110 COVID-19 has relatively unique imaging features in CT manifestations. In early stage 111 (less than 1 week after symptom onset), the predominant pattern was unilateral or 112 bilateral ground-glass opacities. Within 1-3 weeks, ground-glass opacities will 113 progress to or co-existed with consolidations. (3) According to the investigation by 114 Guan et al, (4) at the time of admission, 86.2% revealed abnormal CT scans whereas 115 radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 97.1% of the patients with severe type 116 of COVID-19. What cause the characteristic abnormality found by CT scans? 117Histological examination reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid 118 exudates, which may lead to the changes in CT scans (5) . Fibromyxoid exudates in 119 alveoli may further cause disorder in gas exchange and even respiratory failure, which 120 is consistent with the observation by Li et al.

"Abstract

Objective: This paper studied the relationship between personality traits and mental health conditions of medical personnel to provide a basis and reference for the implementation of targeted education on mental health.A self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China.The overall mean SCL-90 score and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group (p < 0.05), while their average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower (p < 0.01). In addition, personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified.( all p < 0.05).The overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new coronavirus pneumonia is generally higher than that of the norm group in China. The results of this study should contribute to measures to alleviate the psychological pressures on medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus epidemic in China.[Keywords] medical personnel; new coronavirus pneumonia; SCL-90 inventory; mental health; influencing factors All rights reserved.

Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is a pathogenic coronavirus often referred to as the novel coronavirus. On January 12, 2020, WHO officially named the disease Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan in China on December 12, 2019 [1] [2] as causing severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses known to cause illnesses such as cold and more serious diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus that has never been found in the human body before [3] [4] .COVID-19 patients typically show symptoms such as fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and difficulty in breathing. In more severe cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory failure, kidney failure, and even death [5] . There is as yet no specific treatment for COVID-19. Patients mainly receive symptomatic treatment and care for the prevention of complications, while supplementary medical services also appear to be very effective for infected people. The rate of COVID-19 infections has increased rapidly in a short period of time. As of February 17, 2020, the number of confirmed cases exceeded 70,000, with 1,770 deaths [6] . In addition, the disease can cause secondary infections, which has created a huge burden and pressure for the prevention and treatment of the disease in various places. At present, more than 30,000 medical personnel from various medical teams across the country have provided support in Wuhan [7] . Though the help from these medical personnel has relieved the local pressure for medical care to save critically ill COVID-19 patients, there have been serious infections among the medical staff in Wuhan and other places in Hubei Province. At present, over 3000 medical personnel have been infected, which has greatly increased the psychological pressure they experience. In the face of the catastrophic health emergency of COVID-19, medical personnel have been affected by different kinds of subjective and objective factors and confront several mental health problems. Mental illness is a form of human stress response, an explanatory, emotional, and defensive response within the human body, and a physiological response of the human body to the impact of needs or injuries.Therefore, this study aims to analyze the psychological state of medical personnel dealing with COVID-19 and its influencing factors in order to provide an objective basis for the prevention of further transmission, interventions, and countermeasures for COVID-19.

Subjects

This study adopted convenience sampling to recruit research subjects. From January 25 to February 16, 2020, 560 medical personnel from 12 hospitals in eight provinces and cities across the country were enrolled as research subjects. or emergency department, level of concern whether you and your family have been infected, degree of suspicion that you were infected when coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, and whether you have received medical observation recently.The SCL-90 self-report inventory: The SCL-90 inventory, compiled by Derogatis in 1975, includes 10 factors and a total of 90 items. Each factor reflects the symptoms and pain of a patient in a certain aspect, and the distribution of symptoms can be understood through the factor scores. The 10 factors include somatization, obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism, sleep, and diet. Each item was scored using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging none, mild, moderate, moderate to severe, to severe. The total score is the sum of the scores of the 90 items. In previous studies, the homogeneity reliability of the total SCL-90 scale was 0.97, and the homogeneity reliability of each sub-scale was also greater than 0.68. The test-retest reliability was greater than 0.7, and the content validity was above 0.85, which suggest sound reliability and validity.

Survey methods and medical ethics:

The study used online questionnaires for data collection. Researchers conducted surveys upon the completion of general training. All procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University(HRBYKD-A26). The research purpose and methods were explained to subjects to seek their cooperation. Online informed consent forms were signed by participants. They were informed that their participation was completely voluntary, and they could withdraw from the study at any time. The link of the online questionnaire was then sent to a total of 560 medical personnel via the Internet.

Statistical methods:

(1) In this study, data analysis was performed after logical checks using the statistical software SPSS 22.0. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant.(2) Statistical description: The mean value, standard deviation, and frequency were used to describe the demographic data of medical personnel, while the mean value and standard deviation were used to describe the scores for the mental health status of medical personnel responding to COVID-19.(3) Statistical inference: Multivariate linear regression was adopted to analyze the impact of the demographic data of medical personnel on their mental health status.

General information of medical personnel

A total of 560 questionnaires were distributed, and 548 valid questionnaires were recovered, for an effective recovery rate of 97.90%. These 548 questionnaires were completed by medical personnel from eight provinces and cities in China, namely Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, Sichuan, Shanxi, and Shandong.

The 17 items include: hospital, department, occupation, gender, age, highest education level, work experience, level of expertise, marital status, any children, living status, whether you have participated in training for handling of public health emergencies, whether family members support your working on the front line against coronavirus, whether you have supported in affected areas in Hubei, designated hospitals, department of infectious diseases, fever clinics or emergency department, level of concern whether you and your family have been infected, degree of suspicion that you were infected when coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, and whether you have received medical observation recently. Values were assigned to independent variables using the method shown in Table 3 . The α -values for importing and exporting a variable in the regression equation were set to 0.10 and 0.15, respectively. Factors affecting the mental health and status of medical personnel based on their significance from high to low are: the degree of suspicion that they were infected when the novel coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, the level of concern whether they and their family members have been infected, age, whether they have supported in affected areas in Hubei Province, designated hospitals, and other places for the novel coronavirus, and whether family members support them working on the front line (p < 0.05).

As it is highly contagious, many people are frightened by it and even talk fearfully about coronavirus, which can also be observed in front-line medical staff. The results of the study have shown that the overall mean of the SCL-90 and the mean values of the factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of medical personnel were significantly higher than that of the norm group (p < 0.05), while the average score of the interpersonal sensitivity factor of medical personnel was significantly lower than that of the norm group (p < 0.01). More specifically, medical personnel are most of the people closest to COVID-19 patients, so they are at high risk of exposure to the disease. Moreover, they have a deep understanding of the dangers of COVID-19, so they are prone to anxiety and fear. The infection protection procedures for COVID-19 are highly complex and medical staff need to constantly change clothes and replace protective equipment, so they are more likely to establish obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Medical personnel, especially young medical staff, have less experience in the field and in dealing with difficulties and hardships in life.Therefore, when they suddenly encounter such sudden public health events, they tend to suffer anxiety and phobic anxiety, leading to physical and mental problems. That is why scores of the factors somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism were significantly higher than in the norm group. This result suggests that psychologists and team leaders should pay more attention to the anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism issues of the medical personnel in a team. The average score for the interpersonal sensitivity factor of medical personnel was significantly lower than that of the norm group. This shows that in the event of an infectious disease epidemic, the majority of medical personnel are united and have good professional strengths and qualities for self-regulation and self-protection. The results of this study show partial consistency with the studies of the mental health status of front-line medical personnel for SARS in 2003 [9] .

Specific reasons are given in the following sections.3.2.1 Degree of suspicion that they were infected when the novel coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, the level of concern whether they and their family members have been infected, whether they have supported in affected areas in Hubei Province, designated hospitals, and other places for the novel coronavirus, and whether family members support them working on the front line COVID-19 patients are the main source of transmission of the disease. Patients with latent infection (i.e., asymptomatic infection) may also constitute a source of infection [10] . Medical personnel are in frequent close contact with patients during their treatment and care, hence the high risk of infection [11] . Among 138 patients admitted consecutively from January 1 to 28, 2020, to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, the proportion of medical personnel was as high as 29% [12] . A retrospective analysis of 1099 confirmed COVID-19 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces (diagnosis as of January 29) found that the proportion of medical staff was 2.09% [13] . Therefore, medical staff are at high risk of infection and are under great psychological pressure. If they become infected as a result of supporting affected areas in Hubei and COVID-19 designated hospitals, it will not only affect their physical and mental health but also that of their families. Therefore, with the emergence of symptoms and the increase in the level of concern, the mental health status of clinical medical staff may deteriorate. Furthermore, if their families do not support them working on the front line against the disease, then the psychological burden of the medical staff will also increase due to the resulting sense of conflict with professional ethics, resulting in further impact on their physical and mental health.

Age:

We found that the higher the age, the higher the mental health score and the more psychological problems. Based on the age distribution of patients across the country, all ages have no resistance to the novel coronavirus, and a person of any age can be infected as long as virus transmission conditions are met [14] . An analysis of 4021 confirmed patients nationwide (diagnosis date as of January 26) also shows that people of all ages are generally vulnerable to the disease, of whom 71.45% are aged 30 to 65 years [14] . As people get older, the risk of exposure to the disease may increase in people with underlying illness such as asthma, diabetes, and heart diseases [15] . Therefore, older medical personnel have more psychological stress when dealing with COVID-19 patients. It is advised that older medical personnel receive psychological counseling before and during work to help them adjust their status as soon as possible. Despite all the above, this study believes that after such a ""smokeless"" war against the novel coronavirus, the psychological quality of medical personnel can be improved to a certain extent.

Conclusion

In the face of the catastrophic health emergency caused by COVID-19, medical staff have been affected by different kinds of subjective and objective factors. Their mental health problems are a form of human stress response, an explanatory, emotional, and defensive response within the human body, and a physiological response of the human body to the invasion of needs or injuries. In this special environment, their work, life, and emotions tend to be regularly abnormal. Due to the requirements for isolation and disinfection, medical personnel need to wear several layers of protection clothing.This increases the intensity of their work and requires great physical energy, causing severe hypoxia and physical symptoms such as headache and muscle soreness. Other symptoms such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, hostility, and paranoid ideation are all normal psychological reactions in the handling of emergencies and environmental stimuli. In face of a disaster, persons with good mental health will tend to actively take measures such as catharsis, transference, compensation, relaxation, humor, self-consolation, and rational response.

Psychological tests show that people have a process of adaptation to catastrophic emergencies, from initial rejection, shock, and fear, to habituation, acceptance, and calm, to co-existence and living together, which is a regular process. In the face of such a sudden disaster as COVID-19, these psychological symptoms have manifested in both doctors and patients. For medical personnel, it is particularly important to pay attention to mental health conditions while fulfilling their responsibilities. In future research, it is worth exploring how to strengthen the monitoring of mental health conditions of medical personnel and establish an active, systematic, and scientific psychological defense system under such special circumstances.

"Abstract

Classifying the mechanisms of antibiotic failure has led to the development of new treatment strategies for killing bacteria. Among the currently described mechanismswhich include resistance, persistence and tolerancewe propose defiance as a subclass of antibiotic failure specific to prodrugs. Using locked antimicrobial peptides (AMP) that are activated by bacterial 5 proteases as a prototypic prodrug, we observe that although treatment eliminates bacteria across the vast majority of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, concentration of growth nutrients), bacteria spontaneously switch from susceptibility to defiance under conditions that alter the competing rates between bacterial proliferation and prodrug activation. To identify the determinants of this switch-like behavior, we model bacteria-prodrug dynamics as a multi-rate 10 feedback system and identify a dimensionless quantity we call the Bacterial Advantage Heuristic (BAH) that perfectly classifies bacteria as either defiant or susceptible across a broad range of treatment conditions. By recognizing that the bacterial switch from susceptibility to defiance behaves analogously to electronic transistors, we construct prodrug logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT, etc.) to allow assembly of an integrated 3-bit multi-prodrug circuit that kills defiant bacteria 15 under all possible combinations of BAH values (i.e., 000, 001, …, 111) that represent a broad range of possible treatment conditions. Our study identifies a form of bacterial resistance specific to prodrugs that is described by a predictive dimensionless constant to reveal logic-based treatment strategies using multi-prodrug biological circuits.

","INTRODUCTION

The rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria coupled with the lack of newly developed antibiotics has created a serious public health threat 1, 2 . Understanding the causes of antibiotic failure inspires the development of new drugs and informs clinical treatment strategies [3] [4] [5] . These failure mechanisms are broadly classified into three distinct categories (i.e., resistance, 5 persistence, and tolerance), which are characterized by the change in drug concentration and exposure time required to kill bacteria 6 . For example, resistance is characterized by genetic mutations or phenotypic changes which result in bacteria requiring significantly higher concentrations of antibiotic (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) to be lethal. By contrast, bacteria exhibiting tolerance or persistence require increased drug exposure time (minimum 10 duration for killing, MDK), with the latter exhibiting a biphasic killing profile (Fig. 1A) . Further, bacteria populations become tolerant through environmental conditions or genetic mutations, whereas persistence is an actively maintained, non-heritable state exhibited by a subpopulation of bacteria. Discriminating between these survival strategies employed by bacteria is crucial for the development of new drugs and clinical treatment decisions 6 . 15Antibiotic success is markedly improved by proper titration of drugs, as overdosing leads to off-target toxicity and underdosing increases the likelihood of pathogens developing resistance 7 . However, optimal drug doses are difficult to achieve over the course of treatment because infection burden changes dynamically over time, creating a moving target 7, 8 . Prodrugs, which represent ~10% of all FDA-approved drugs in the last decade, are a promising solution 20 because they may be automatically titrated by a disease-related activation mechanism, increase bioavailability, and reduce the risk of off-target effects 9 . For example, prodrugs such as ganciclovir 10 and isoniazid 11 are administered as biologically inactive forms and are enzymatically activated by the pathogen. Here, we use prototypic auto-titrating prodrugs comprising cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMP), which evolved as a part of innate immunity and display broad-25 spectrum and prokaryote-specific antimicrobial activity 12 . Cationic AMPs act by disrupting bacterial membranes and inducing inflammatory responses 13 , but suffer from off-target toxicity and low stability in vivo 14, 15 . Our AMP prodrugs are activated directly by bacterial proteases, which are a major cause of virulence [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] during infections and important targets for antibiotic development 22 . Of these proteases, outer membrane protease T (OmpT) is a membrane-bound 5 bacterial protein that is widely conserved across gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family and recognizes a variety of targets that contribute to its virulence (e.g., plasminogen) 18, 19, [23] [24] [25] . In this work, we design cationic AMPs that are locked by charge complexation with anionic peptides and connected with a protease-cleavable linker substrate [26] [27] [28] that is recognized by E. coli protease OmpT, such that increasing concentrations of bacteria 10 activate higher concentrations of free drug.While AMP prodrugs eliminate the majority of bacteria, we observe bacteria populations exhibiting a phenotype we named ""defiant"", proliferating in the presence of active drug by consistently outpacing prodrug activation at all stages of growth (i.e., log phase, stationary phase).To understand the mechanism by which bacteria become resistant to AMP prodrugs, we built a 15 system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODE) that model the dynamics of the bacteriaprodrug competition. We use this model to identify a dimensionless quantitythe Bacterial Advantage Heuristic (B.A.H.)which predicts with perfect accuracy whether bacteria will become defiant under a broad range of environmental conditions. At low BAH values, bacteria are susceptible to elimination, but beyond a critical BAH threshold, the bacteria switch to a state of 20 defiance, in which the bacteria proliferate in the presence of activated drug. To combat prodrug failure due to defiance, we design biological circuits that eliminate bacteria under all conditions (BAH values) by recognizing that AMP prodrugs behave analogously to transistors: above a critical BAH threshold (i.e., gate voltage), bacteria (i.e., input current) pass through the prodrug and exhibit defiance. We use this framework to build logic gates with prodrug transistors, which 25 .

These quantitative mechanistic insights will inform future drug design and treatment protocols to combat antibiotic resistance.

A bacteria-activatable prodrug targets E. coli protease OmpT

To construct bacteria-activated prodrugs, we synthesized cationic (polyarginine) AMPs in charge complexation with anionic peptide locks (polyglutamic acid) by a linker peptide (RRS|RRV) specific for the ubiquitous bacterial protease OmpT 26 . Upon proteolytic cleavage of the linker, the hairpin prodrug is unlocked to release free AMP, creating a mechanism for auto-titration (Fig. 1B) . 10To demonstrate linker specificity for OmpT, we synthesized an activity probe 24, 29-33 with free linker peptides containing a fluorophore-quencher pair and detected OmpT activity in samples incubated with recombinant OmpT or live E. coli culture. Conversely, we observed no activity in samples containing the serine protease inhibitor, Aprotinin, which inhibits OmpT when present in micromolar concentrations 23 (Fig. 1C) . We observed similar cleavage activity using this linker 15 substrate when fully integrated into hairpin AMP drug-lock complexes, confirming that linker presentation within a constrained conformational state did not affect cleavage activity by OmpT (Fig. 1D) . To measure cytotoxicity of unlocked drug, we dosed bacteria with free AMP and observed significant reduction in colonies compared to untreated controls (blue bars) (Fig. 1E,   F ). To confirm prodrug specificity, we synthesized AMP drug-lock complexes using linker peptides 20 specific for OmpT or Tobacco Etch Virus Protease (TEV), which exhibits orthogonal protease specificity 34 . We observed elimination of bacteria only in samples containing OmpT-specific AMP prodrugs (grey bars) or samples treated with both TEV and TEV-specific AMP prodrugs (red bars).All control samples containing either TEV-specific prodrug alone or Aprotinin inhibitor did not 6 significantly reduce bacteria load (Fig. 1E, F, Table S1 ). Our results showed that AMP drug-lock complexes are inert and lack cytotoxic activity until activation by protease activity.

Kinetic model of prodrug treatment reveals a binary outcome

To quantitatively understand how the rate of prodrug activation competes with the number 15 of living bacteria, we built a mathematical model using a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE). In our system, the three dynamic populations are the Bacteria, B, the Locked drug, L, and the Unlocked drug, U, for which we formulated governing ODEs by considering the system parameters that affect populational change over time. For this prodrug system, increased E. coli growth results in increased proteolytic activation of AMP, which in turn lyses bacteria to 20 create a negative feedback loop. Therefore, we modeled the bacteria population B as increasing (i.e., green dashed arrows) the rate of enzymatic drug conversion (i.e., L to U) and the unlocked drug population U as increasing the rate of bacterial death (Fig 2A) . To account for the fact that bacterial growth rate, r, slows down as environmental resources become limiting (i.e., carrying capacity, Bmax), we used a logistic growth model 35 , which produces an S-shaped curve and has 25 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint been used extensively in biology to study population expansion 36 and tumor growth 37 Here we assumed our system constituted a well-mixed solution of freely diffusing substrates (i.e., locked drug) in large excess, which were valid assumptions for this study since AMP prodrug was present 10 at concentrations ~10 2 micromolar in an aqueous environment. Because the total amount of drug is conserved, we defined the MM activation rate of unlocked drug, U, as opposite of the degradation rate of locked drug L (Equation 1.3) . We further included a term to account for the loss of active AMPs according to a proportionality constant, a * , that represents the number AMP required to kill one E. coli. This term was necessary as AMPs lyse E. coli by intercalating with 15 bacterial membranes 39 and therefore are removed from the system and unable to target additional bacteria.To fit this model to our system, we measured the values for relevant parameters, including 20 enzymatic efficiency (e.g., kcat, Km), bacterial growth (e.g., r, Bmax), and prodrug activity (e.g., a, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint a * ) (Fig. S1 , Table S2 ). This allowed us to predict bacteria-prodrug response curves (red and blue dashed lines; Fig. 2B ) across nine distinct combinations of kcat and r values, which we experimentally controlled by altering the ambient temperature and concentration of broth (conditions labeled A1-3, B1-3, and C1-3; Table S3 ). Strikingly, our model anticipated a binary bacterial response to prodrug treatment that would be evident within 24 hours; bacteria were 5 predicted to be either susceptible to the prodrug and die (red dashed lines) or to exhibit a druginvariant phenotype and proliferate to saturating levels (blue dashed lines) (Fig. 2B, C) . To experimentally validate our model predictions, we incubated bacteria with prodrugs under the defined nine conditions, and quantified the number of living bacteria longitudinally over the course of a 24 hour treatment window. Quantified bacterial counts taken during the course of treatment 10 as well as at endpoint closely matched the values predicted by our model (R 2 = 0.84, red and blue dots; Fig. 2B , C) and likewise revealed a binary bacterial response to prodrugs leading to antibiotic failure. We therefore called this form of resistance to prodrugs as bacterial ""defiance.""Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that when E. coli are exposed to the AMP prodrug, our model can be used to predict bacterial growth kinetics, which ultimately result in a binary 15 outcome..

Predicting bacterial defiance with a dimensionless parameter

Having demonstrated that bacteria exposed to a prodrug exhibit a binary outcomesusceptibility (i.e., death) or defiance (i.e., survival)we next sought to determine whether the behavior could be quantified by a metric of resistance that could be generalized across broad treatment conditions. Based on our model and experimental validation, we observed that under defiance, 15 populations of live bacteria expanded (i.e., positive growth rate) throughout the course of treatment, which implied that key bacterial growth parameters (e.g., r, Bmax) were greater in value than enzyme-driven death rate parameters (e.g., kcat, Km) (Fig. 2B, 3A) . Therefore, to derive a metric to discriminate between defiant and susceptible bacteria, we used Buckingham Pi theorem to identify a dimensionless quantity that represents the competing balance between growth rate 20 and enzymatic turnover, which we defined as the Bacterial Advantage Heuristic The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint This quantity reflects that bacteria have a higher probability of switching to the defiance phenotype under conditions that promote a faster growth rate, r, and slower enzymatic activity, kcat. To predict the onset of the defiance phenotype, we sought to determine the critical B.A.H. value that distinguishes defiant bacteria from susceptible populations. Using our mathematical model, we simulated >2000 prodrug treatment conditions covering a range of values for r, Bmax, kcat, and Km 5 and identified a critical value of BAH at which bacteria switch from susceptibility to defiance (BAHcrit ~ -11.37) (Fig. 3B) . In other words, for any environmental or genetic condition that produces a BAH > BAHcrit, the bacteria will survive the prodrug treatment, and for BAH < BAHcrit, the bacteria will die. To test the robustness of this switch-like behavior, we modeled treatment outcomes by varying bacterial growth rates (r) and enzymatic efficiencies (kcat) (> 100 points) and 10 found that BAHcrit was time-independent across a range of prodrug treatment durations. (Fig 3C-E) . Additionally, to demonstrate that BAHcrit is independent from any system parameter, we modeled treatment outcomes (> 500 points) by individually fixing each of the four parameters (i.e., r, Bmax, kcat, and Km) in turn and found that BAHcrit was invariant across all conditions tested (Fig   3F-I) . To confirm the value of BAHcrit experimentally, we first used the nine experimental 15 conditions previously tested (A1-3, B1-3, C1-3) to fit the values for kcat and r (Fig S2) , and then used the computationally-derived critical BAH threshold to classify the phenotype of nine bacteriaprodrug treatment conditions. By receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis, BAHcrit perfectly predicted the onset of defiance (Fig. 3J ,K AUROC = 1.00, n = 9) with 100% specificity and sensitivity. Our model results predicted that changing key system parameters to decrease 20 the B.A.H. below the critical threshold will result in successful treatment of defiant bacteria. To demonstrate this, we took three different AMP prodrugs with distinct linker sequences (Table S1) with increasing kcat values for OmpT to decrease the B.A.H. below BAHcrit, which allowed us to successfully treat previously defiant populations of bacteria (Fig. S3) . These findings are important for the successful design and administration of prodrug therapies, which may be 25 improved by optimizing fundamental pharmacokinetic parameters.

Combating bacterial defiance with prodrug biological circuits

Our model revealed that bacterial defiance arises during prodrug monotherapy when 5 environmental parameters, as represented by a dimensionless constant, crosses a critical transition BAH value. To combat bacterial defiance, we therefore sought to design a multi-prodrug approach to eliminate defiant bacteria that would otherwise resist treatment to a single prodrug (Fig. 4A) . To do this, we recognized that the bacterial switch from susceptibility to defiance could be considered as behaving analogously to electronic transistorstransistors allow input current 10 (Iin) to pass (Iout) when the gate voltage (G) crosses a threshold, whereas with AMP prodrugs, input bacteria (Bin) survive treatment (Bout) when the BAH (gate) crosses a critical value (Fig. 4B) .Under this analogy, we postulated that multiple prodrug biological transistors could be used to construct logical operations (i.e., AND, OR, NOT gates) that allow for the design of integrated biological circuits that output state ""0"" (i.e., bacterial death) for all possible inputs. These biological 15 circuits would then be representative of a multi-prodrug strategy to eliminate bacteria even when input BAH variables (i.e., temperature, nutrient level, enzyme activity) would result in a state of defiance for a single prodrug. To accomplish this, we designed complementary N-type and P-type transistors, which are required to construct all possible logic gates 40 . N-type transistors allow input current to pass when the gate signal is above a defined threshold, whereas P-type transistors 20 allow current to pass when the gate signal is below a defined threshold. We constructed N-type transistors with our AMP prodrug system, which allowed input bacteria (Bin = 1) to survive (Bout = 1) when the BAH is above BAHcrit which we used to define the gate threshold (i.e., BAH > BAHcrit equivalent to G = 1; BAH < BAHcrit equivalent to G = 0) (Fig. 4B) . To create P-type transistors, we synthesized heat-triggered liposomes 41 (Fig. S4) loaded with the antibiotic ampicillin 42 , which was 25 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint released at temperatures above 37 o C to kill bacteria (i.e., Bout = 0) (Fig. 4C) . Above this critical temperature, treatment with AMP prodrugs leads to bacterial defiance (i.e., BAH > BAHcrit or G = 1) and E. coli survive prodrug treatment by proliferating significantly faster than prodrug activation 43 . We therefore defined temperatures above 37 o C as corresponding to G = 1 and below as G = 0 for our P-type biological transistor to match inverse gate values for our N-type biological 5transistor. These results demonstrated that antimicrobial drugs could be modeled with similar input and output characteristics compared to N-type and P-type transistors. heat-triggered, drug-loaded liposomes allow the input bacteria (Bin) to survive (Bout = 1) when the gate signal (G) is low (i.e., G = 0 when temperature < Tcrit). All truth tables depict binary inputoutput combinations.To demonstrate the use of multiple prodrug transistors in biological circuits capable of killing defiant bacteria, we selected three variables (i.e., bacterial nutrients, temperature, linker 15 substrate kcat) that independently influence bacteria-prodrug competition to act as circuit inputs (i.e., A, B, and C respectively). For each circuit input, we assigned the value 0 or 1 by fixing all other variables and choosing one condition that enabled bacterial survival (i.e., IN = 1 when BAH > BAHcrit) and one condition that resulted in bacterial death (i.e., IN = 0 when BAH < BAHcrit). We then designed a biological circuit to kill bacteria (i.e., OUT = 0) under all eight combinations of 20 nutrient (LB Broth = 0% or 2%), temperature (T = 30 o C or 37 o C), and linker substrate (kcat = 7 x 10 7 s -1 or 2 x 10 6 s -1 ) conditions while using three AND gates and one NOT gate (Fig 4A) .Electronic AND gates are created by placing two transistors in series; similarly, we sequentially dosed bacteria with two prodrugs, each with corresponding BAH values to represent the gate inputs (i.e., A and B). We controlled the corresponding BAH value for each prodrug with the linker 25 .

When exposed to all four possible inputs, bacteria only survived the condition with two low kcat prodrugs (i.e., AB = 11), which matched the ideal outputs of an AND gate (Fig. 5B) . These results show that dosing multiple prodrugs in sequence reduces the fraction of bacterial populations that survive (e.g., one 5 prodrug = 50% survival, two prodrugs = 25% survival, etc.). Whereas the AND gate comprised prodrugs in series, we demonstrated one implementation of an OR gate by splitting a population of bacteria in half (i.e., separate wells), dosing each with a different prodrug during the same time interval (i.e., in parallel) and recombining the bacteria post-treatment. Using this circuit, bacteria survived in any case where at least one half of the population was dosed with low kcat prodrug 10 (i.e., AB = 01, 10, or 11), matching the ideal outputs of an OR gate (Fig. 5C) . We created a NOT gate by using a P-type transistor comprising ampicillin-loaded heat-triggered liposomes, which caused bacteria to die at high temperatures (i.e., IN = 1) and survive at low temperatures (i.e., IN = 0). (Fig. 5D) . These results show that heat-triggered liposomes can be used as a fail-safe to kill bacteria above the critical temperature representing the onset of the defiance phenotype. To 15 validate the multi-prodrug circuit, we incubated populations of bacteria under each of the eight environmental conditions with three prodrugs: (1) an AMP prodrug with fixed kcat/Km, (2) an AMP prodrug with kcat/Km determined by input C, and (3) a heat-triggered, drug-loaded liposome (Fig.   4A) . Whereas a single prodrug only eliminated bacteria in half of the input cases (Fig. 5E) , our circuit autonomously eliminated bacteria under all eight combinations of the three environmental 20 signals (Fig. 5F) . These results demonstrate that by utilizing the transistor-like properties of prodrugs, we can design and administer biocircuits that combat bacterial defiance.

DISCUSSION

The rising threat of antibiotic failure has motivated the classification of resistance mechanisms to improve the design of future treatment strategies. In this work, we identified a prodrug-specific subclass of resistance, which we named defiance. To study bacterial defiance, we synthesized an AMP prodrug that was activated by bacterial protease activity and successfully 10 killed E. coli. However, we found that this prodrug failed in conditions where the bacteria grew faster than the rate at which they activated the drug. We developed a mathematical model of the bacteria-prodrug competition and derived a dimensionless constant (BAH), which we used to perfectly predict the onset of the defiance phenotype. These studies revealed that both environmental (e.g., temperature, available nutrients) and pharmacokinetic (e.g., activation rate 15 kcat) parameters can be tuned to engineer successful prodrug therapies. In future work, this information could be leveraged to improve the efficacy of existing prodrugs by tuning the prodrug decay constant (i.e., biological half-life), which directly changes the BAHcrit value. Alternatively, the catalytic efficiency of the prodrug substrate could be tuned to change the BAH value and increase the probability of success, which has been previously demonstrated by engineering 20 prodrug substrates with higher affinity for the enzymatic target 44, 45 .In our study, insights into bacterial defiance were elucidated in the context of AMP prodrugs that activate by an extracellular mechanism of action. We anticipate that this phenomenon of defiance also extends to prodrugs that are intracellularly activated, which .

To account for intracellular activation, our model would include a transport rate term to account for prodrug diffusion across cell membranes 47 . The implications of our model will likely still hold if prodrug transport is not the rate limiting step (i.e., represents a separate mechanism by which bacteria can escape treatment) and is greater than the rate of prodrug activation. This is a reasonable assumption given that the rates of drug 5 diffusion across membranes 48, 49 are on the order 10 10 -10 17 -fold higher than the typical range of prodrug activation rates 50, 51 .By comparison to established forms of resistance, prodrug defiance could occur from either genetic or phenotypic changes. For example, both phenotypic resistance (i.e., non-inherited resistance) and tolerance are acquired under specific conditions that affect growth rate, such as 10 in biofilms 6, 52 . By contrast, inherited resistance arises from genetic mutations that alter key bacterial processes including metabolism, enzymatic activity, and drug efflux pumps 53 . In our studies, we demonstrated that environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, nutrient levels) affect the defiance phenotype; however, it is also likely that the onset of defiance could also arise from genetic mutations that affect E. coli growth rates or cleavage activity or proteases [54] [55] [56] . Our findings 15suggest that prodrugs currently used in the clinic may fail due to the onset of bacterial defiance.For example, the nitroimidazole class of antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole, dimetridazole, tinidazole, etc.), which is used to treat anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterococcus species, Clostridium species, Helicobacter pylori, etc.) represent prodrugs that are activated by bacterial reductases 57 . Genetic studies have revealed that bacterial resistance to nitroimidazole antibiotics is caused by either 20 partial or complete reduction in expression of genes (e.g., rdxA, frxA, etc.) encoding the reductases that activate the prodrug [58] [59] [60] . These changes in the activating enzyme would decrease the rate of prodrug activation, thereby resulting in a reduced overall BAH, that if below BAHcrit for the system, would result in defiance.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint As bacteria-activated prodrugs are an emerging strategy to treat antibiotic resistant infections 9 , our work may provide strategies for preventing defiance-related resistance mechanisms in new and existing prodrugs. To propose strategies for treating prodrug defiance, we leveraged the transistor-like behavior of prodrugs to design a multi-drug circuit to eliminate defiant bacteria that would normally survive the treatment of a single prodrug. In these 5 experiments, we tested eight discrete combinations of three variables (e.g., nutrients, temperature, and linker substrate) and showed that the multi-drug logic circuit effectively eliminated bacteria in all eight conditions. In future work, different variables (e.g., O2, pH, relative biodistribution, etc.) could be included to increase the range of possible treatment conditions. This would require a quantitative understanding of the relationship between the variable and how it 10affects key components of the BAH (i.e., r or kcat). Ideally, these variables will proportionally influence either the growth rate or the enzymatic activity of the bacteria, such as how increasing substrate efficiency increases kcat, which creates one critical value (BAHcrit). By contrast, variables that influence growth rate or enzyme activity with multiple critical values (i.e., inflection points) limit the range of applicability. For example, higher temperatures increase both growth rate and 15 enzymatic activity, but above critical temperatures, protein enzymes denature, resulting in irreversible loss of activity 61 . However, these values are beyond relevant biological values and do not limit the applicability of these prodrug treatments to normal physiological conditions.Here, we quantitatively studied the mechanism of prodrug defiance and revealed logicbased strategies for successfully treating bacteria. We envision that this body of work will motivate 20 the development of new prodrugs and improve the clinical administration of existing prodrugs, ultimately helping to reduce the burden of antibiotic failure.

Measuring kinetic parameters for the ODE model

To measure drug cytotoxicity, we quantified the percent of viable bacteria when exposed to unlocked AMP drug doses ranging from nanomolar to millimolar concentrations and observed a 5 spike in cytotoxicity in the micromolar range (Fig. S1A) . To calculate bacterial growth rate constants, we incubated bacteria in broth or water at 37 o C and measured OD600 over the course of 8 hours, revealing a higher growth rate in broth consistent with published values 35, 56 (3.0 > 0.1 h -1 ) (Fig. S1B) . To quantify enzymatic velocity, we measured proteolytic velocity (moles L -1 s -1 ) under substrate concentrations ranging from 0-200 uM and fit the Michaelis-Menten equations 10 to this data to calculate kcat and Km (Fig. S1C ). Using these measured parameters (Table S2) , we generated kinetic curves for bacteria number and drug concentration over time. The model showed that after a period of initial bacterial growth, the lagging drug population eliminated the infection burden. While the initial reservoir of locked drug concentration was ~200 µM, the unlocked drug never rose above 5 µM (Fig. S1D) , revealing that this system maintains the minimal 15 drug concentration required to kill the infection.

Estimating bacterial growth rate and enzymatic activity with parameter fitting

To estimate bacterial growth rate (r) and enzymatic activity (kcat), we used parameter fitting methods to a simplified model without a prodrug (Fig. S3) . In this model, the prodrug is substituted with a fluorescent probe (P), which is activated with the same substrate sequence as the AMP prodrug. To simplify the model, we defined one bacterium, with ~ 2.5 × 10 3 OmpT proteases per 5 cell 62 , as equivalent to one effective enzyme. The concentration of cleaved fluorescent probe is monitored over time, and the bacterial concentration is quantified at serial time points. We fit this data to the two equations modelling bacterial gr"
"Abstract

The key parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a disease is the reproduction number . If it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To prevent the expansion of an epidemic, must be reduced to a level below 1. To estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. In this letter,given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of reproduction number of COVID-19 in China. By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary track of the epidemic in China, which is well in accordance with that of the real incident cases.The simulation results predict that China's epidemic will gradually tend to disappear by May 2020 if the quarantine measures can continue to be executed.

In December, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China was caused by a novel coronavirus, the COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] [4] . At first the local governments did not take effective measures which leaded to local people not paying enough attention to the risk.However, with the epidemic in Wuhan further expanding, the Chinese Government started to take emergency actions to lock down the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020.Despite this, the epidemic still spread throughout the entire country. By March 12, 2020, controlling the spread of the epidemic has become a global challenge. One of the key parameters in epidemic models is the basic reproduction number 0 , defined as the number of secondary infections that arise from a typical primary case in a completely susceptible population [5] . As an infection is spreading through a population, it is more convenient to work with an effective reproduction number , which is defined as the number of secondary infections that arise from a typical primary case [5] . The magnitude of is a useful indicator for evaluating the risk of an infectious disease and the validity of controlling the epidemic. If exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To prevent the expansion of an epidemic, must be reduced to a level below 1. Using the parameter , one can establish the susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemic model as below [6] [7] [8] :where ( ), ( ) and ℛ( ) are the number of susceptible, infectious, and removed (including recovered and death) individuals at time ; denotes the generation interval that is the time from infection of an individual to the infection of a secondary case by that individual, namely, the ""contagion period"" of an infection [5] . The generation interval should be a random variable. If we denote the number of populations by , we have:simulate the evolutionary track of this epidemic. To estimate the reproduction number , the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease, ( ), is required to be available [5, [9] [10] [11] [12] ; however, this distribution is often unknown. In the existing literature, many scholars used exponential distribution [5] , normal distribution [5] , Weibull distribution [9, 10] , and Gamma distribution [3, 12] to approximate ( ). Theoretically, to use these distributions to approximate ( ), one needs to know enough information about symptom onsets of all cases, namely, large sample cases for . Regarding the incomplete information, one also applied the Monte-Carlo method [4] and Bayesian statistical inference [11] to estimating ( ). However, thus far, there is scant literature to discuss the potential application of the maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) [13] [14] [15] in estimating the reproduction number. Our letter fills this gap. In the statistical inference, MaxEnt is a powerful tool of predicting probability distributions. The main idea of MaxEnt is to estimate a target probability distribution by finding the probability distribution of maximum entropy, subject to a set of constraints that represent our incomplete information for the target distribution [13] .Due to the advanced predictive capacity, MaxEnt has been widely applied in thermodynamics [13] , economics [16] [17] [18] [19] , artificial intelligence [20] [21] , and ecology [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .In this letter, we apply the MaxEnt to determining the function shape of ( ).Before doing so, we first introduce the relationship between and ( ). Here, we adopt Wallinga and Lipsitch's method [5] for deriving the reproduction number. By both authors' method, the number of infectious individuals at time can be written as [5] :where ( , ) denotes the number of cases infected by a -day infectious individual at time . Here denotes the maximum symptom duration. Wallinga and Lipsitch assumed [5] = +∞. To make the model more realistic, we assume that is a finite number. Thus, the reproduction number can be defined as [5] :.

If ( ) and ( ) are known, one can calculate the reproduction number by using equation (11) . Generally speaking, the number of infectious individuals ( ) is reported for each day, while the function shape of ( ) is unknown. Therefore, many scholars used exponential distribution [5] , normal distribution [5] , Weibull distribution [9, 10] and Gamma distribution [3, 12] to approximate ( ). To do so, one needs to collect enough information of , which requires examining a large number of cases. From a practical point of view, it is easier to collect a sample set of cases (at least 30 samples)to calculate the approximate estimates of the mean value ̅ and the variance 2 . Given the approximate estimates of ̅ and 2 as the prior information, we maximize the information entropy of the generation interval to infer the function shape of the probability distribution ( ). This is the basic idea of the MaxEnt, which agrees with everything that is known, but avoids assuming anything that is not known [15] . The resulting statistical inference gives the least biased predictions of the shapes of probability distributions consistent with prior knowledge [23] .Now we apply the MaxEnt to determining the probability distribution function .

To this end, we assume that the mean value ̅ and the variance 2 of the generation interval are known. By equation (8), we define the information entropy of the generation interval as:Because we only know the mean value ̅ and the variance 2 , maximizing the information entropy (12) should yield:To solve the optimal problem (13), we construct the Lagrange function:where ′ , , and are Lagrange multipliers.Plugging equation (14) into the functional derivative ℒ[ ( )] ( ) ⁄ = 0 we get the optimal solution:where = exp(− ′ − 1).Theoretically, substituting equation (15) into equations (8), (9) , and (10) one can calculate the values of , , and . However, it is difficult to obtain the analytic results of integrals (8), (9) and (10). To do numerical calculation for equations (8) , (9) , and (10), we assume that ( ) quickly tends to 0 as ≫ 1. The validity of this assumption can be justified by checking equation (15); therefore, equations (8), (9) and (10) can be written as:Based on equations (16), (17) and (18), we propose a numerical method to calculate .

Given the accuracy of 0.01, by inputting the observed values of ̅ and 2 , we calculate , , and . We first apply equation (26) to the SARS epidemic in Singapore in 2003, where ̅ = 8.4 (days) and.

Substituting both observed values into equation (26), we seek the lattice-point minimizing equation (26) as below:Substituting equation (27) into equation (15) we have:The shape of equation (28) The latest clinical research [1] showed that the generation interval of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS. Therefore, we assume that the generation interval of COVID-19 shares the same probability function shape as that of SARS. This assumption was also adopted by Wu et al [4] . Based on this assumption, we apply equation (28) Because the observed data of ( ) was reported for each day, we denote the unit of time by ""day"". To calculate by using equation (29) By using equation (30) we can report the reproduction number every 14 days..

According to the report of China CDC [2] , January 8, 2020 was considered as the last day of a contagion period in Wuhan, China; therefore, we mark January 9, 2020 as the first day of the next contagion period. Based on this setting, the first period we report is from January 9, 2020 to January 22, 2020. In fact, this setting agrees with the date of locking down the Wuhan city, January 23, 2020. Here, we have collected the national-level data of the accumulative infected, recovered, and death cases of China's epidemic from January 10, 2020 to March 4, 2020, see Figure 2 . By using the data in Figure 2 , it is easy to calculate the number of real-time infected cases, ( ), in China for each day. This result has been shown in Figure 3 . Using the data in The results have been listed in Table 1 . The first period (from January 9, 2020 to JanuaryThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.14.20035659 doi: medRxiv preprint quarantine measures, the reproduction number for the second period (from January 23, 2020 to February 5, 2020) has been reduced to 3.122 with the reduction amplitude being 15 .78%. For the third period (from February 6, 2020 to February 19, 2020), the reproduction number has remarkably been reduced to 1.2114, which is close to 1. This implies that the epidemic has been effectively controlled. It should be pointed out that the last day of the third period (February 19) is just the turning point of the epidemic, refer to Figure 3 ; therefore, the real data supports our calculations for the reproduction number. As the epidemic come to the fourth period (from February 20, 2020 to March 4, 2020), the reproduction number is eventually reduced to 0.6028, a level below 1. In this sense, China's quarantine measures have obtained a preliminary success.To further test the validity of the reproduction numbers in Table 1 , we substitute them into the SIR model (1)-(4) for simulating the evolution of China's epidemic. To this end, let us first check the scope of application of the reproduction number formula (11) , which is derived by equation (5) . By the mean value theorem of integrals, equation (5) can be rewritten in the form:where 0 ≤ ≤ .By equation (6) and (31) we have:On the other hand, if we assume that is a constant (step function) for each period, by equations (1)-(4) it is easy to get:Let us order:By using equation (34), equation (33) can be approximately written as:which implies.

Comparing equations (32) and (36), we find that the reproduction number formula (11) can be applied to the SIR model (1)-(4) if the approximation (34) holds. Equation Table 1 into the SIR model (1)-(4) to simulate the evolution of China's epidemic. The result is shown by Figure 5 , where the evolutionary track (red circles) of the epidemic is well in accordance with that (black circles) of the real incident cases inChina. The simulation result requires ≈ 8, which agrees with our previous setting = 8.4 ± 3.8 [9] . Furthermore, we find that the reproduction numbers of quarantine periods in Table 1 can be fitted by an exponential function with 2 = 0.9924, see Figure 4 . Therefore, we apply this exponential function to predicting the reproduction numbers for the next seven periods (from March 5, 2020 to June 10, 2020). The results have been listed in Table 2 , where we also present the predicted values of the number of real-time infected cases for the last day in each period. These predicted values imply that China's epidemic will gradually tend to disappear by May 2020, see the blue circles in Figure 5 .In conclusion, to estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. In the existing literature, many scholars used exponential distribution, normal distribution, Weibull distribution, and Gamma distribution to approximate the generation interval distribution. To do so, one needs to collect enough information about symptom onsets of all cases, which requires examining a large number of cases. By contrast, the maximum entropy method has more advantage of predicting probability distributions given the incomplete information. In this letter, we argue that, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, one can determine its probability distribution function by using maximum entropy method.

Chinese people were aware of the outbreak of COVID-19 after January 21, 2020 and local governments did not take effective measures to control the epidemic during this period. Unfortunately, the data in the first period is very incomplete. By contrast, the reported infected cases on January 10 (41 cases) and January 22 (571 cases) can be roughly used. Consider that the first period is a free propagation stage, we use both data to approximately restore real-time data of this period by the exponential growth formula 571 = 41 • exp(12 • ), where denotes the growth rate.

"Abstract

The ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a clinical setting. Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. This simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement for complex diagnostic infrastructure..

","INTRODUCTION

The emergence of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV, now named SARS-CoV-2) has infected tens of thousands of people in China, with cases in at least 28 other countries and prompting a worldwide response. The diagnostics industry has responded rapidly, with Emergency Use Authorization granted for PCR-based tests from the US CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html), Seegene in Korea and BGI in China (https://www.bgi.com/global/company/news/bgi-develops-realtime-dna-based-kit-for-detecting-the-2019-novel-coronavirus/) among many other providers releasing reagents, primers and probes, and other materials to support this urgent public health need. The current diagnostic standard combines clinical symptoms and molecular method, and as many of the symptoms resembles those of common cold and influenza, an accurate molecular result is critical for final diagnosis. These molecular methods include metagenomics sequencing mNGS (1) and RT-qPCR(2), both are excellent and sensitive techniques, but approaches not without limitations. mNGS is restricted by throughput, turnover time, formidable high cost and requirement for high technical expertise. As with most molecular diagnostics, RT-qPCR is the most widely used method, but it requires expensive laboratory instruments and is difficult to utilize outside of well-equipped facilities. In combination to the different patient samples containing variable number of virus, a high proportion of patients were diagnosed as false negatives (3, 4) .Here we describe a molecular diagnostic approach for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and simple visual detection of amplification for potential use in rapid, field applications. LAMP was developed as a rapid and reliable method to amplify from a small amount target sequence at a single reaction temperature, obviating the need for sophisticated thermal cycling equipment (5) . Since the initial description of LAMP, a number of advancements in detection technology have helped establish LAMP as a standard method for simple isothermal diagnostics. These detection methods have allowed detection by visual examination without instrumentation using dyes that utilize inherent by-products of the extensive DNA synthesis, such as malachite green (6), calcein (7) and hydroxynaphthol .

We recently developed a method for visual detection of LAMP amplification (9) using pH-sensitive dyes to exploit the change of pH that resulting from proton accumulation due to dNTP incorporation. This method has been used in a large scale field survey of Wolbachia-containing mosquitos (10), Grapevine red blotch virus without DNA extraction (11) , testing urine samples for Zika virus (12) and even amplification detection on the International Space Station (13) . The breadth of application highlights the applicability of visual detection methods to provide an advantage in simplicity and portability for enabling new, rapid diagnostics.This study describes testing and validation of 5 sets LAMP primers targeting two fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 genome using short (~300bp) RNA fragments made with in vitro transcription and RNA samples from patients. We also demonstrate compatibility with simple approaches to RNA purification to simplify the detection procedure and avoid complex RNA extraction, and with clinical swab samples taken from COVID-19 patients. Our aim is to share this information in order to help develop a reliable and easy method to detect this viral RNA outside of sophisticated diagnostic laboratories and expand the toolbox of molecular tests used to combat and surveil this growing public health threat.

LAMP Primer Design and Testing

We designed 5 sets of LAMP primers targeting two fragments (Table 1) of SARS-CoV-2 sequence (GenBank accession number MN908947) using the online software Primer Explorer V5 (available for free use at: https://primerexplorer.jp/e/). DNA fragments containing these two regions were synthesized as gBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) and T7 RNA polymerase promoters were added by PCR (NEB M0493, numbers indicate NEB catalog ID unless otherwise noted) using primer pairs where one primer containing the promoter sequence. RNAs were then synthesized by in vitro transcription (E2050) using these PCR products as templates and purified using RNA clean up columns (T2040). The resulting RNAs as well as the gBlocks were serially diluted in 10-fold increments using 0.1x TE buffer containing 0.01% Tween 20. RT-.

If the samples were not for use immediately, they were stored at 4 °C.

Extraction of Viral RNA and RT-PCR detection

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We designed 5 full LAMP primers sets targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with amplicon regions designed to the 5′ region of the ORF1a gene and Gene N. Each set was tested with synthetic DNA substrates and RNA transcribed from that DNA substrate before consideration for use clinically. To evaluate detection sensitivity, synthetic RNAs were serially diluted from ~120 million copies down to ~120 copies (per 25 μ L reaction) at 10fold intervals in LAMP reactions. All five primer sets showed similar detection sensitivity and could consistently detect as low as a few hundred copies, with sporadic detection of 120 copies (or 4.8 copies/μL; Fig. 1 ). The results from colorimetric detection were 100% in agreement with the real time detection. To estimate the relative efficiency using RNA or DNA templates, we compared synthetic RNA with similarly diluted gBlock dsDNA on real-time LAMP signal (Fig. 2) . For the 2 primer sets we compared, one showed slightly slower amplification and detection with RNA template while the other appeared slightly faster, confirming the RNA is efficiently converted to cDNA by the reverse transcriptase (WarmStart RTx) and subsequently amplified via LAMP by the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (Bst 2.0 WarmStart)..

We investigated whether it is possible to perform detection using crude cell lysate in order to avoid this RNA purification step. The results indicated that ~480 copies were detected with all four primer sets, a similar sensitivity as the detection sensitivity with synthetic RNA alone (Fig. 3A) with no interference by the lysate to either the amplification efficiency or visual color change. We also tested whether we could recover the synthetic RNA spiked into biological sample with a mock experiment during purification of total RNA. We spiked various amount of synthetic RNA into whole human blood and purified the total blood RNA. We were able to recover and detect the spiked RNA (Fig. 3B) , indicating the total RNA has no interference during the purification or the detection process. While the column-based approach is less compatible with the simple, field detection enabled by colorimetric LAMP, this is a typical laboratory workflow and can be used with simple isothermal amplification in a similar fashion to more expensive and involved qPCR detection workflows.With this preliminary evaluation of potential LAMP primer sets, the best performing sets (ORF1a-A, GeneN-A) were shared and synthesized in Wuhan for testing with actual COVID-19 samples. RNA was extracted from swabs using the standard laboratory protocol (see Materials and Methods) and RNA tested in colorimetric RT-LAMP alongside a commercial RT-qPCR assay. In addition to controls, a total of 7 patient RNA samples were tested, 6 of which were determined to be positive by RT-qPCR using ORF1a primers (C q 25-36.5, Table 2 ) and 4 positive with Gene N primers. One sample was negative by both RT-qPCR primer sets. When these samples were tested in the colorimetric LAMP assay, all 6 RT-qPCR positive samples showed visible color change indicating positive amplification, while the single RT-qPCR negative samples maintained pink color and was judged negative (Figure 4 ). Thus the colorimetric LAMP assay showed 100% agreement with the RT-qPCR results across a range of C q values. Although a small number of samples were tested here, the colorimetric LAMP assay enables reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection without sophisticated instrumentation, matching the RT-qPCR performance in field and point-of-care settings..

Not only purified RNA can be used as the sample input, but also direct tissue or cell lysate may be used without an RNA purification step. This combination of a quick sample preparation method with an easy detection process may allow the development of portable, field detection in addition to a rapid screening for point-of-need testing applications. This virus represents an emerging significant public health concern and expanding the scope of diagnostic utility to applications outside of traditional laboratories will enable greater prevention and surveillance approaches. The efforts made here will serve as a model for inevitable future outbreaks where the use of next generation portable diagnostics will dramatically expand the reach of our testing capabilities for better healthcare outcomes.

"Abstract

In 2014, A novel tick-borne virus of the genus Flavivirus was first reported from the Mogiana region in Brazil. This virus was named the Mogiana tick virus (MGTV). Later, MGTV was also named as Jingmen tick virus (JMTV), Kindia tick virus (KDTV), Guangxi tick virus (GXTV) etc. In the present study, we used small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) to detect viruses in ticks and detected MGTV in Amblyomma testudinarium ticks, which had been captured in Yunnan province of China in the year of 2016. The fulllength genome sequence of a new MGTV strain Yunnan2016 (GenBank: MT080097, MT080098, MT080099 and MT080100) was obtained and recommended to be included into the NCBI RefSeq database for the future studies of MGTV. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that viruses named MGTV, JMTV, KDTV and GXTV are monophyletic: the MGTV group (lineage) of viruses. We show, for the first time, that5′ and 3′ sRNAs can be used to obtain full-length sequences of the 5' and 3' ends of, but not limited to genome sequences of RNA viruses. And we proved the feasibility of using the sRNA-seq based method for the detection of viruses in a sample containing miniscule RNA.

","Introduction

Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been widely applied to virus and viroid discovery in plants and animals. Compared to other NGS based methods that require viral enrichment and concentration, the small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) methods simplify virus detection and indeed have several other advantages [1] . The sRNA-seq based method was originally used for viral detection and identification in plants [2] and in invertebrates [3] . Although the sRNA-seq based method does not perform as well in the detection of mammalian viruses as in the detection of plant or invertebrate viruses, we still detected eight mammalian viruses: HPV-18 (Human Papillomavirus type 18) [4] , HBV (Hepatitis B Virus) [4] , HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) [4] , HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1) [4] , SMRV (Squirrel Monkey Retrovirus) [4] , EBV (Epstein-Barr Virus) [4] , SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) [5] and a DNA segment of ASFV (African Swine Fever Virus) [6] . The discovery of featured RNA fragments, including siRNA duplexes [7] , 5′ and 3′ end small RNAs (5′ and 3′ sRNAs) [8] [9] , palindromic small RNAs (psRNAs) and complemented palindromic small RNAs (cpsRNAs) [5] , has increased our capacity to detect viruses in mammals. Moreover, we found that 5′ and 3′ sRNAs can be used to annotate nuclear non-coding and mitochondrial genes at 1 bp resolution [10] [11] . Then, we found that 5′ and 3′ sRNAs can be used to obtain the full-length 5' and 3' ends of, but not limited to genome sequences of RNA viruses at 1-bp resolution.Ticks transmit a great variety of infectious agents to humans and other animal species, including viruses of the Flaviviridae family among the most common tick-borne viruses [12] . With the development of NGS, a number of studies have used metagenomics to search for tick-associated pathogens [13] . However, the metagenomics methods using DNA can not be applied to detect RNA viruses without DNA stages. So the transcriptomics approaches using total RNA were also applied to detect tick viruses [14] . The sRNA-seq based method has been successfully used in the detection of Rickettsia in ticks [15] . As far as we know, there had not been previous reports of virus detection in ticks using the sRNA-seq based method until the detection of the DNA segment of ASFV [6] . Although very high-depth sRNA-seq data was used to detect a DNA segment of ASFV, the coverage of the ASFV reference genome was still very low. This suggested that the sRNA-seq based method does not perform as well in the detection of DNA viruses as in the detection of RNA viruses.In our previous study [6] , we used sRNA-seq to detect viruses in ticks. Subsequent analyses of the detected viruses led to the discovery of a new strain of RNA virus. In 2014, this virus was first reported as a novel tick-borne virus of the genus Flavivirus from the Mogiana Region in Brazil [12] . Later, this virus was also named as Jingmen tick virus (JMTV), Kindia tick virus (KDTV) or Guangxi tick virus (GXTV) in some data from the NCBI GenBank database (Results and Discussion). In humans, viruses closely related to MGTV were found to be primarily associated with patients in Kosovo [16] . In the present study, we reported a new MGTV strain Yunnan2016 detected in Amblyomma testudinarium ticks [17] and also aimed to achieve . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Detection of viruses in ticks using sRNA-seq data

Ticks of Amblyomma testudinarium, D. nuttalli, D. niveus and D. silvarum were captured in our previous studies. Then, the sRNA-seq data from these ticks was produced and deposited in the NCBI SRA (accession numbers SRP084097 and SRP178347; Table 1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.004796 doi: bioRxiv preprint ""Data"" (the first column) was aligned to the reference genome (the 3rd column) to obtain the information on the fourth and fifth columns.

The reference genome of the MGTV strain Xinjiang2016 (GenBank: MK174251, MK174244, MK174230 and MK174237) was used to report Yunnan2016.

Full-length genome sequence of the MGTV strain Yunnan2016

In our previous study, we proposed that 5' and 3' sRNAs can be used to annotate nuclear non-coding and mitochondrial genes at 1-bp resolution, and to identify new steady RNAs, which are usually transcribed from functional genes [9] . In the present study, we used 5' and 3' sRNAs (Figure 2A) The full-length genome sequence of the MGTV strain Yunnan2016. CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.004796 doi: bioRxiv preprint * the MGTV strain Yunnan2016 (GenBank: MT080097, MT080098, MT080099 and MT080100). A. 5' and 3' sRNAs were used to obtain the full-length 5' and 3' ends of RNA1; B. The 5' ends and 3' sRNAs of all RNAs in the Yunnan2016 genome; C. Start codons are marked in red boxes and RNA2 has a 15-or 18-bp variable region; C. Start codons and stop codons are marked in red and blue boxes, respectively. For RNA4 of some viruses, ""GTG"" were identified as the stop codons of the second ORF and the nearby ""ATG"" codons are 48-bp downstream of the ""GTG"" codons.Compared to the genome coverage of 86.47% (Methods) and average depth of 46.52 (Methods) when we used the Xinjiang2016 genome for reference (Figure 1A) , genome coverage increased to 97.37% and average depth to 91.11 % when we used the Yunnan2016 genome for reference ( Figure 1B) . Comparing the full-length genome sequence of Yunnan2016 with those of 16 other MGTV complete genomes (Methods), we found that all of the other complete MGTV genomes did not have the correct full-length 5' and 3' ends.Particularly, RNA1 (GenBank: MN025516) and RNA4 (GenBank: MN025515) of the MGTV strain TT2017-2 had 56 and 48 bp additional sequences at their 5' ends, respectively. Further analyses showed the additional sequences were identical to internal regions of the genomes. Obviously, these additional sequences had been wrongly assembled in the previous studies. Since our results showed the high quality of our full-length genome sequence of the MGTV strain Yunnan2016, we recommend that our sequencebe included in the NCBI RefSeq database for the future studies of MGTV.

Although these four CDSs had large differences in their degree of evolutionary conservation, the tree topologies were still congruent ( Figure   3BCDEF ). Viruses named as MGTV, JMTV, KDTV and GXTV belong to a MGTV group with two major clades. The two branches oif Clade I had the virus strains isolated from Brazil and Guinea, and the virus strains Yunnan2016 and Xinjiang2016 (Figure 3F) . The Yunnan2016 strain was detected in A. testudinarium whereas the Xinjiang2016 strain was detected in wild rodents but its biological vector is still unknown. In Clade II (Figure 3F) , the virus strain Kosovo2013 was from humans whereas the strains TT2017-1/-2 were detected in Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. Viruses closely related to MGTV were primarily associated with patients in Kosovo: two of the three patients had a history of tick bites [16] .

Phylogenetic analysis of MGTV complete genomes

However, the biological vectors of the strains infecting human are still unknown. The Antilles (France) strain was detected in a pool of R. microplus and mblyomma variegatum ticks and the RT-PCR of individual ticks revealed that MGTV existed with a higher prevalence in R. microplus (42%) than A. variegatum (5%) [18] . 

Conclusions

In the present study, we reported a high-quality, fully curated and full-length genome sequence of a new strain of the Mogiana tick virus (MGTV), Yunnan2016. And we show, for the first time, that 5′ and 3′ sRNAs can be used to obtain full-length sequences of the 5' and 3' ends of, but not limited to genome sequences of RNA viruses.

Among these strains, the Antilles (France) strain was detected in a pool of R. microplus and A. variegatum ticks. R. microplus is one of the most widely distributed tick species in the world [19] . R. microplus primarily parasitizes livestock, but it may also feed on people in China. The detection of MGTV in A. testudinarium was reported for the first time in Laos. The nucleotide identity between the genome of the MGTV strain from Laos and the Yunnan2016 genome was 94.73%. Compared to other ticks, the host-range of A.testudinarium is very large, including mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds, with widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of Asia [20] . The detection of MGTV in wild rodents and humans indicates that the ticks (e.g. R. microplus and A. testudinarium) host MGTV: this hypothesis should be well investigated in future studies.

Methods

The full-length genome sequence of the MGTV strain Yunnan2016 has been deposited into NCBI GenBank database under the project accession numbers MT080097, MT080098, MT080099 and MT080100.In the present study, the 17 MGTV complete genome sequences (including the Yunnan2016) were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database and analysed together. One genome sequence was removed because it had too many ambiguous nucleotides. The online software CD-HIT [21] (Date: 20191212) was then used to remove redundant sequences, resulting in 9 complete genome sequences for the phylogenetic analysis. The sRNA-seq data used in the present study was also deposited in the NCBI SRA database under the project accession number SRP084097 and SRP178347 ( Table 1) . Using specific primers ( Table 2) , PCR amplification coupled with Sanger sequencing was used to fill the gaps between contigs and to confirm the assembly results.

RNA1, RNA2, RNA3 and RNA4 of the MGTV strain Yunnan2016 have been submitted to the NCBI GenBank database under the project accession numbers MT080097, MT080098, MT080099 and MT080100, respectively. The software Fastq_clean [22] was used for sRNA data cleaning and quality control. The virus detection was performed using the pipeline VirusDetect [23] . For each detected virus, VirusDetect assigned a closest reference genome from the NCBI Genbank database to help characterize that virus. VirusDetect used reference genome coverage and average depth to quantify the detected viruses for verification. Genome coverage was defined as the proportion of read-covered positions divided by genome length whereas average depth was the total number of base pairs of aligned reads divided by the read-covered positions of the reference genome. Statistical computation and plotting were performed using the software R v2. 15.3 with the Bioconductor packages [24] .

"Abstract

medRxiv preprint Background: The 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention. As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China.Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers.Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days.The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further reduce the ܴ to below one in order to end the current epidemic.

","Introduction

On December 29, 2019, Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in Central China, has reported four cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology. Since then, the outbreak has rapidly worsened over a short span of time and has received considerable global attention. On January 7, 2020, the pathogen of the current outbreak was identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and its gene sequence was quickly submitted to WHO (The coronavirus was renamed COVID-19 by WHO on February 12). 1,2 On January 30, WHO announced the listing of this novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) as a ""public health emergency of international concern"". As of February 11, 2020, the National Health Commission (NHC) of China had confirmed a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) associated with the COVID-19 in Mainland China, including 1114 fatalities and 4771 recoveries.Since January 19, 2020, strict containment measures, including travel restrictions, contact tracing, entry or exit screening, non-hospital isolation, quarantine, awareness campaigns and others, have been implemented by the Wuhan Government and quickly adopted by other cities within China with the aim to minimize virus transmission via human-to-human contact. Similar measures were previously employed in China in 2009 to tackle the outbreak of H1N1 including mandatory quarantine of anyone who has had close contact with confirmed patients.This article investigates the change in the basic reproduction number ܴ and controlled reproduction number ܴ since the outbreak of COVID-19. We have found that the estimated .

Data

Data were collected from provincial/municipal health commissions in China as well as through ministry of health in other countries and regions with details of each confirmed case including case ID, region, age, gender, date of symptom onset, date of diagnosis, history of traveling to or residing in Wuhan, and, if any, related remarks such as contact identification, cases and case-related information. In addition, the collected dataset also contains date of infection and chains of transmission of infection which can be inferred from travel or residency history in Wuhan and other relevant information, if available, as follows:(1) If the individual has not been to Hubei Province recently, but were exposed within a four-day period (i.e., the individual has had contact with a confirmed case of NCP on a certain day), then the corresponding date of infection is inferred as the middle of the exposure period;(2) If the individual has travelled to Hubei Province but has returned within four days, then the date of infection is inferred as the middle of the travelling period;(3) If the individual has not been to Hubei Province recently, but in close contact with an imported case from Hubei, then the individual is identified to be infected by this imported case;(4) If the individual has not been to Hubei Province recently, but in close contact with a local case who was clearly infected before that individual, then this individual is identified to be infected by the corresponding local case.Note: if the individual has been to Hubei Province, the transmission history would not be recorded despite the existence of contact tracing information.

Inference about the Serial Interval and Infectious Period

In this study, serial interval is defined as the time difference between dates of infection of successive cases in a chain of transmission (different textbooks may have different definitions). Infectious period is the duration of which an infected individual can transmit pathogens to a susceptible host. In this study, infectious period is defined as the time difference between date of infection and date of diagnosis as there is strong evidence showing that a diseased individual remains contagious even during the incubation period, and would be immediately isolated upon positive diagnosis hence losing the transmissibility. Both are key quantities that depict an epidemic and are essential to estimate the basic/controlled reproductive number, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .Hence, the corresponding serial intervals were approximated by the differences in dates of symptom onset rather than the actual dates of infection, see Figure 1 . We can see that some serial intervals are negative which is certainly impossible by definition. However, noting that the serial intervals were approximated from the dates of symptoms onset, this suggests that the negative values could be caused by different lengths of incubation period between individuals. Here a simple correction is implemented by resetting the negative values to zeros. This shifts the average of the serial intervals to 4.41 days and the standard deviation to 3.17 days after corrections, see table 1. Note that the serial interval of SARS-nCoV in Hongkong was 8.4 days on average. 3 In addition, a total of 67 cases in the collected data were able to identify the corresponding dates of infection. Figure 2 plots the histogram of infectious period while Table 2 shows the numerical summary. .

Therefore, the inference made on serial interval and infectious period based on the corresponding subsets should be able to represent the full dataset.

Since January 19, 2020, various containment measures have been strictly implemented, especially after the State Council agreed to include NCP into the Management of the Infectious Diseases Law and the Health and Quarantine Law on January 20. Based on an average10.91-day infectious period estimate from our collected data, we expect a flatter rate of increment starting on January 29. Figure 3 plots the number of daily new cases in a log-scale against date, and, as anticipated, the trend supports our guess. Therefore, the quantities ܴ and ܴ are estimated based on collected data in two separate periods, i.e., from January 21 (the starting date of daily updates of confirmed cases .

Table 3 and Table 4 . Despite the disagreement between different estimation methods, all three methods indicate notable reductions from ܴ to ܴ which suggests an improvement in the current situation. This is possibly due to the effective interventions and prompt actions by the local and central governments to minimize further spreading. We also notice that EGR yields smaller estimates of ܴ compared to other methods. This might be because the number of infected patients does not grow exponentially after such strict containment measures. 

Conclusion

Despite the continuous increase in new confirmed cases on a daily basis, the estimated controlled reproduction numbers ܴ produced by all three methods in all different regions are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers ܴ . As discussed in Section 4, the real-time controlled reproduction number may be even lower than the estimated values in Figure 3 . Nonetheless, additional effort is needed to further reduce ܴ below one in Hubei Province..

Discussion

The dataset used in this study is based on the confirmed cases reported by NHC China. However, during the period of data collection, the official guidelines for diagnosis and treatment were updated four times. The criteria of confirmation have evolved from the original ""whole genome sequencing of the respiratory excretion"" to ""positive viral nucleic acid results by the RT-PCR of the respiratory excretion or viral gene sequence"", and, most currently, the inclusion of positive nucleic acid results of the blood sample. In the meanwhile, the confirmation process is simplified by removing the accreditation process by the national expert committee for confirmed cases. The fourth edition granted the accrediting authority to the municipalities. 11 In addition, the medical resources in Hubei Province especially in Wuhan have been enhanced remarkably. All of these changes might result in a temporary surge of confirmed cases and lead to an overestimation of ܴ , especially in Hubei Province. .

"Abstract

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is of global concern and has recently emerged in the US. In this paper, we construct a stochastic variant of the SEIR model to make a quasi-worst-case scenario prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US West and East Coasts. The model is then fitted to current data and implemented using Runge-Kutta methods. Our computation results predict that the number of new cases would peak around mid-April 2000 and begin to abate by July, and that the number of cases of COVID-19 might be significantly mitigated by having greater numbers of functional testing kits available for screening. The model also showed how small changes in variables can make large differences in outcomes and highlights the importance of healthcare preparedness during pandemics.

","Introduction

Coronaviruses (CoVs) comprise a family of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that are known to infect a broad range of animals ranging across mammals and birds. CoVs have been prevalent worldwide for several decades [8, 26] and cause diseases generally associated with the respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and nervous systems. To date, there are seven CoVs that are known to infect humans and are associated with respiratory symptoms. Four CoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HKU1) present relatively mild respiratory tract infections [26] , [6, 15] , the 2012 MERS outbreak [36] , and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [37] . As CoVs have a global distribution, exhibit considerable genetic diversity and genomic recombination, and have zoonotic potential while sympatry between humans and wildlife increase [5, 26] , it is very likely that there will be new CoV outbreaks in the future.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (previously 2019-nCoV) originated from Wuhan city in Hubei province of China [37] . While the first case was reported in December 2019, it has since been thought to emerge as early as November 2019 [25] . Since then, COVID-19 has continued to spread around the world, and at this date, over 150 countries have been affected [3] . Although some countries have managed to contain COVID-19 efficiently, others previously thought to have been well-prepared for outbreaks due to higher living standards and healthcare quality have witnessed an unexpected number of cases [24] . As a result, the scale of COVID-19 within each nation has become relatively uncertain and has only heightened social and economic unrest. COVID-19 was first reported in the US on January 20, 2020 [11] . While little initial action was taken during the initial days, an exponential increase in the number of cases [24] spurred immediate actions in an attempt to contain COVID-19. For instance, social distancing is being enforced via the closure of educational institutions, restrictions on travel, and suspension of events, and research funding for SARS-CoV-2 has increased. Unfortunately, containment of COVID-19 has been hindered by various factors, such as the initial production of defective test kits [27] , a current limited availability of test kits [28, 29] , and lack of medical supplies [30, 31] . It is currently unclear how well the US healthcare system will cope with the COVID-19 pandemic over the next few months, especially in view of the lack of adequate projections of the scale of COVID-19infections and mortality across the country.In this paper, we attempt to construct a mathematical model that simulates the scale of COVID-19 outbreak in the US. Despite the uncertainty of the pathogenicity and molecular virology of SARS-CoV-2 [23] , a few key features pertaining to its transmissibility have been studied. The basic reproduction number 0 , which represents the average number of new infections an infectious person can cause in a naïve population, generally range from 2.3 to 2.9 [22, 33, 38] . The incubation period (the time between initial exposure and development of symptoms) is approximately 5.2 days on average [16, 19] , and the infectious period (the time from onset of symptoms to isolation) is approximately 3 days on average [20, 21] . These transmission features are useful parameters to consider for modeling, which we will describe in detail next.

Methods: Designing the Model

To model the COVID-19 outbreak, we use a variant of the SEIR model (see [7, 18] for some examples). We mainly focus on the East and West Coast of the United States. We assume that there is no travel between the different population zones, and that the natural birth and death rates are equal. In Figure 1 , S represents the susceptible population, and E represents the exposed population (i.e. individuals who have been infected but are not yet themselves infectious). The infected population I divided into two groups, and , wherein the subscripts H and C stand for ""hospital"" and ""community"" respectively. represents those that are infected and isolated (such as those that have been pre-tested and found to carry the virus), and for those that are infected but not isolated (such as those with unreported cases or present mild symptoms that are overlooked). Thus, people in is unable to spread the virus whereas those in can spread the virus. As testing kits in the US are currently in low supply, the current model projects significantly higher levels of than at any given point in time. Once infected, there are two possibilities: either recovery or death. These outcomes are represented by the populations R and D above, with .

We also assume the recovered population will have acquired immunity to the virus and are no longer susceptible.In the mathematical model underlying Figure 1 , we treat the various symbols above as functions over time, and the precise variables for ordinary differential equations are as follows.

Variable

DefinitionThe reciprocal of the incubation period The reciprocal of the infectious period 0The basic reproduction rate, defined to be the value / The contact rate per unit time The proportion of exposed that are pre-tested The proportion of infected that diesThe expression = + + + + + represents the effective total population in the US, i.e. the population that matters for the purposes of virus transmission. Then, for each coast in the US, the discussion above can be mathematically modeled as follows.Notice that 0 is not present in the model above. However, 0 is important as the contact rate is hard to directly estimate, and we will use 0 and to estimate using the relation = 0 .The basic reproduction rate is also not static over time, and we will use different values over the following three phases:• Phase 1: There is no action done on the epidemic• Phase 2: Some action is done to slow down the epidemic, and the coast is preparing for the next phase..

This is because 0 = 1 represents a neutral reproduction rate, whereas 0 < 1 and 0 > 1 represents less and more spread, respectively. The next section describes in detail how we simulate our model.

Methods: Implementing the Model

We simulated our model in MATLAB to prepare for a quasi-worst-case-scenario. We employed a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method [12] to numerically solve the above specified ordinary differential equations, with the range ∈ [0, 250] and stepsize ℎ = 1 3 (both measured in days). As for the initial conditions for each coast, we assume that there will not be any pre-existing immune responses that may help defend against the virus, due to SARS-CoV-2 being sufficiently divergent from other CoVs [23] . Hence, the entire population is initially susceptible due to the virus. For example, if a single infected person is introduced at 0 = 0 to a population of 53 million people (e.g. West Coast US, including Seattle), we will then have ( 0 ) = 53 * 10 6 , ( 0 ) = 1, andWe estimate the proportion of pre-tested exposed individuals ρ is set to be 0.1, and the mortality rate c is set to be 0.05 [2, 35] . The basic reproduction rate 0 is specified based on the government response to the outbreak (the three phases); for instance, if a partial shutdown is implemented at time 1 , and then a full shutdown at 2 , we will have 1 ≤ 0 ( 2 ≤ ≤ 250) ≤ 0 ( 1 ≤ ≤ 2 ) ≤ 0 (0 ≤ ≤ 1 ) . In our case, using the estimates obtained in [21] and depending on the coast being studied, we set the first phase 0 (0 ≤ ≤ 1 ) to be either 2.7 or 2.9, the second phase 0 ( 1 ≤ ≤ 2 ) to be either 2.3 or 2.5, and the third phase 0 ( 2 ≤ ≤ 250) = .

The West Coast will take the lower of the two values to account for the lower average population density.To account for the variations of incubation period −1 and infectious period −1 within the population, we sampled 100 values of each of them from an Erlang distribution of shape 2 [21] at each timestep . Let us denote these 100 values as −1 ( ) and −1 ( ), where = 1, … , 100.The Erlang distribution for which we sampled −1 from has a mean set to be 5.2 days, and for −1 , 3 days, as suggested by [16, 19, 20] . The minimum of the distribution range is also restricted to be 1, i.e. minimum possible incubation period is 1 day. Correspondingly, we will have 100 values of the contact rate for at timestep, ( ) = 0 ( ) ( ). We then performed 100 iterations of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta for each of these , , and to obtain 100 values for the next timestep, +1 . Finally, the mean of these 100 values at +1 was taken. It is also important to note that at every iteration, the effective total population should be updated.In summary, our chosen values are organized in the following author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .

Results

Using elements outlined in the previous sections to model the situation for the West Coast, East Coast, as well as the entire US, we ran 50 simulations using the model described in the previous section. We then compared our simulation results to current data between January 20 and March 19 [2, 13] , assuming a delay in reporting time of about 8 to 10 days and using population estimates derived from [4] .

The West Coast

The first case of COVID-19 in the West Coast was reported on January 20, 2020 in Seattle, WA.We used a population estimate of 53 million. If January 20 is designated Day 0, we assume Phase 2 started at around Day 45, and Phase 3 started at around Day 60. The simulation results suggest that, under quasi-worst-case-scenario, the data for the number of people infected by COVID-19 is far more than reported: about 80% of (those infected but not isolated) are not accounted for. This is probable as many symptoms of COVID-19 may be passed off as just cases of mild flu. In the quasi-worst-case-scenario, we predict the number of reported infections at its peak to be about 25,000 (Fig. 2 ) and the actual number of infections at about 90,000 ( Fig. 3) ..

The East Coast

The first case of COVID-19 in the East Coast was reported on February 1, 2020 in Boston, MA.However, since no other new cases were reported for about two weeks, we assume a starting time of one month later than for the West Coast. In the graphs below, we will still plot them starting from the first reported case in the US (i.e. January 20). For the East Coast, we used a population estimate of 152 million. Based on government actions, we also assume that the starting dates for Phases 2 and 3 are about a week behind that of the West Coast. The simulation results are similar to that of the West Coast; for a quasi-worst-case scenario, the actual number of infections is predicted to be about 400,000 for reported (Fig. 4) , and about 1,450,000 for the actual number of infections (Fig. 5 ).

The United States: Hypothetical 25% Infected Worse-Case Scenario

As COVID-19 has escalated into a pandemic, we also considered that a greater number of people would fall ill due to the lack of prior immunity. Considering the previous pandemic, the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic where around 24% of people were infected [14] , as well as the nonstatic nature of our variables, we ran another simulation on the entire US population with approximately 22% to 26% of the population infected (based on randomness) to predict such a scenario. For this simulation experiment, we used values for and starting days of the phases that was a rough weighted estimate of the two coasts, but used the same values for the other variables as described in the previous section. We also assumed five infected individuals were introduced into the population.As Fig. 6 illustrates, in this quasi-worst-case-scenario, about 3.8 million of the US population would die from COVID-19 (assuming a death rate of 5%), and the remaining 76.2 million would recover from the virus..

Discussion

This paper presents a model for simulating the scale of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.The simulations focused on the West and East Coasts (Figs. 2-5) , and also modeled a hypothetical worst-case scenario for the entire US (Fig. 6) . The model implemented factors specific to the US, which include the three phases of government response, travel restrictions that restrict crossboundary transmissions, and limits to testing kits and healthcare accessibility resulting in semistrict isolation.The model fits the reported data by assuming that about 80% of the non-isolated cases are not reported (Figs. 2, 4) ; however, the actual number of cases may be much higher (Figs. 3, 5) .That assumption agrees with a prior study [17] and provides another evidence that COVID-19 is not easy to contain. The model also predicts that the peak of the outbreak would occur by early April, and the outbreak would wind down by the start of July. However, the model does not account for delays in reporting; as such, one should expect the peak reported number of infections to occur .

In addition, the peak would occur sooner on the West Coast, which was affected first. However, all peaks should occur around mid-April unless there are major changes to the reproduction rates, for which there is no current evidence. It should be noted that the trends in the model's estimates share similarities with the epidemic curves during the SARS and MERS outbreaks [32, 34] .One way to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 is to successfully isolate more infected people, i.e. to have a higher relative proportion of over . That outcome should be achieved when defective testing kits are replaced and more testing kits are allocated, so that more exposed people can be tested and isolated accordingly. For instance, if 50% more people had been tested ( = 0.15) since the start of the outbreak, the model would predict 40% of the projected severity However, the sudden onset of COVID-19 and the overall unpreparedness of the United States make these data inaccessible. It should also be noted that while the global mortality during COVID-19 is currently 3.8%, it is noticeably different across nations [24] . As a result, we chose a 5% mortality rate ( = 0.05) in our quasi-worst-case scenario prediction of COVID-19 in the US. Other factors at a molecular level can further modulate our variables. For instance, the actual 0 in the US might be different as the transmissibility and infectivity of CoVs have been shown to be modulated by abiotic factors such as temperature and humidity [1] , and the robustness of host immunity further affects the etiology, pathogenesis, and overall virulence of CoVs [9] . As .

Moreover, simulations can vary noticeably with small variations in assumptions and parameters. To cite one example, minor changes in the distribution of the infected population between and can dramatically affect the model's predictions. Also, at the societal level, the length of time that the cohort of patients remain hospitalized is often unknown in the early stages of a pandemic, and can greatly influence the use and deployment of medical supplies and personnel, thus altering the course of the infection and recovery rates.Nevertheless, the few scenarios presented and discussed in this paper strongly suggest that even with current containment and mitigation efforts, the COVID-19 outbreak will significantly impact the health of the US population..

Note that more reported cases are initially observed than originally projected because testing many more people shifts potentially unreported to the cohort. Two peaks are observed for the West Coast: the original peak is projected have already passed, and implementing 3X more tests will result in another peak of reported infections.

"Abstract

Guided by the principle of primum non nocere (first do no harm), we report a cautionary note on the potential fatal toxicity of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with anti-diabetic drug metformin. We observed that the combination of CQ or HCQ and metformin, which were used in our studies as potential anti-cancer drugs, killed 30-40% of mice. While our observations in mice may not translate to toxicity in humans, the reports that CQ or HCQ has anti-COVID-19 activity, the use of CQ resulting in toxicity and at least one death, and the recent Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for CQ and HCQ by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prompted our report. Here we report the lethality of CQ or HCQ in combination with metformin as a warning of its potential serious clinical toxicity. We hope that our report will be helpful to stimulate pharmacovigilance and monitoring of adverse drug reactions with the use of CQ or HCQ, particularly in combination with metformin.

Methods. Animal experiments were conducted following approval by the Animal Care and Use

Committee guidelines of the Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD). Tumor bearing or nontumor bearing immunocompromised mice were injected with 100 µL of saline vehicle, chloroquine (CQ, 60 mg/kg), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, 60 mg/kg) and/or metformin (250 mg/kg) once daily intraperitoneally daily for 4 weeks as described [2 3] . A combination of CQ and metformin in the above-mentioned dose and frequency was administered to animals in the combination treatment group. In a separate study, non-tumor bearing immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice were treated with HCQ and metformin once daily in the abovementioned dose for 38 days. Blood was drawn for chemistry and hematology via cardiac puncture, and organs and tissues were harvested, examined and processed for transmission electron microscopy as described [3] .Results. Based on our previous findings that metformin and CQ or HCQ curbed the growth of human pancreatic xenografts in athymic nude mice [2 3], we sought to determine whether the combination of metformin, which inhibits mitochondrial Complex I, and CQ that inhibits autophagy could be synergistic as an anti-cancer metabolic cocktail.

To determine whether immunocompromised nude mice were particularly sensitive to the combination, we treated immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice with the metformin+HCQ, which resulted in 30% lethality.We then sought to determine the basis for the toxicity of metformin+HCQ combination in autopsy studies and found that body weights were not significantly different ( Table 1) among the different groups. While organ weights were not different among the groups, we observed via transmission electron microscopy an increase in the number of autophagosomes in the heart, liver and kidneys of athymic nude mice treated with metformin+HCQ combination ( Figure 1C ). While the hematological findings were not different among the groups, we found that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) levels were elevated in all treatment groups as compared to control vehicle treated group ( Table 1 ).Discussion. Between March 16 and 21, 2020, partly based on a non-randomized study using HCQ with azithromycin [4] , claims disseminated through Twitter and amplified by the media that CQ or HCQ could be a therapy for COVID-19. Many individuals have started to take this drug, resulting in chloroquine poisoning in Nigeria (@NCDCgov #COVID19Nigeria) and a death in Arizona. Notably, CQ and HCQ doses which are used for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, could lead to the development of hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy and retinopathy [5] .Here we report the lethality of metformin+CQ or +HCQ as a warning of its potential deadly toxicity, noting that the dosages in mice are similar to those in human with allometric scaling.Consistent with our findings, the combination of CQ and metformin resulted in CNS neuronal damage after cardiac arrest in rats [6] .

"Abstract

As an emerging infectious disease, the 2019 coronavirus disease has developed into a global pandemic. During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short-term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non-Markovian models to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectories. In addition, shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly.

","Introduction

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, in the late fall of 2019 (Chen et al., 2020) . The highly contagious virus outbreak during the Chinese Spring festival period made containment an unprecedented challenge. The risks of human-to-human transmission, long persistence on surfaces, and asymptomatic infections increased spread and made case detection difficult (Chan et al., 2020; Rothe et al., 2020) . Increasing case reports saturated hospitals in Hubei Province, overwhelming medical resources. Despite the high case reports, the true infection rate was likely underreported, as infected individuals with only mild symptoms might have recovered without being detected Sanche et al., 2020) .To stop the viral spread, a series of strict control measures have been implemented in mainland China, including the enforcement of the tourism ban, suspension of the school, and extension of the Spring Festival holiday. From January 23 rd to April 8 th , 2020, the Chinese government implemented a metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and nearby cities, suspending all public transportation and advising residents to stay at home (Du et al., n.d.; J. T. Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020) . Since February 8 th , a door-to-door check was started in Wuhan to take all confirmed and suspected people into medical care, which ended at around February 19 th (X. Li, Zhao, & Sun, 2020) .Understanding the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic dynamics is crucial for decision-makers to take proper actions to contain the COVID-19. Since the beginning of the outbreak, scientists have been actively retrieving the epidemiological characteristics such as the time from infection to illness onset (incubation period) and the time from illness onset to hospital admission or isolation (infectious period) (Chen et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Linton et al., 2020) . Researchers have used the reported cases during the early stage of the epidemic and predicted the epidemic trajectory, the basic reproductive number 0 from which ranges from 2.2 to 6.6 (Read, Bridgen, Cummings, Ho, & Jewell, 2020; Sanche et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . Several studies explored the effects of the quarantine of Wuhan (X. Shen, Peng, Guo, Xiao, & Zhang, 2020) , travel restrictions (Chinazzi et al., 2020) , and other non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies (Lai et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) on the future transmission dynamics at different geographical scales.China's aggressive and prompt measures have led to a dramatic decrease in the number of new cases. Those measures saved many lives, although at a high economic cost. As of March 18 th , 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in China was 81,186. Compared to the previous day, the number of new cases was only 70, most of which were imported from outside the country (T. Wu, Ge, Yu, & Hu, 2020) . In the meantime, COVID-19 has further spread around the world, and countries like Italy, South Korea, the United States, and Iran are struggling to contain the epidemic.In this work, we aim to assess the capability of the ensemble Kalman filter as a good short-term predictor, and test the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading. First, we provide real-time assessments and forecasts of the case reported in Wuhan City based on the ensemble Kalman filter. Second, we build an individual-level based network model and perform stochastic simulations to reconstruct the epidemics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the epidemic dynamics under different scenarios. We consider four scenarios: keeping the early-stage trend without any mitigation, reducing the average node degree within a city through social distancing, reducing the infection rate by adopting protective measures, and decreasing the infection rate through both social distancing and protective measures. Third, we simulate the epidemic spreading in Wuhan City incorporating non-Markovian processes, i.e., non-exponential parameter distributions, and compare the predicted epidemic trajectories obtained from Markov processes.Mathematical modeling can forecast the size and timing of epidemics, so resource allocations and decision-making can be optimized to maximize intervention strategies. Since most current network-based models are based on Markov processes, this work is probably one of the first to simulate the COVID-19 spreading based on non-Markovian processes. The findings of this work can be a reference for policy recommendations regarding COVID-19 in other countries.

Model

In this section, we first introduce the ensemble Kalman filtering method used in the short-term analysis. Then we illustrate epidemic models based on Markov processes and non-Markovian processes built in the long-term analysis.

Short-term analysis

We aim to provide short-term prediction for the COVID-19 spreading in Wuhan city based on the Kalman filtering, which consists of model state estimation at each observation time based only on the observation up to the present. Considering that there is an unknown time-varying parameter β in the SIR model which cannot be dealt with by widely used classic Kalman filter (Kalman, 1960) and extended . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 Kalman filter (Jazwinski, 2007) , a dual state-parameter estimation filtering method-ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is used for our study (Jensen, 2007; Moradkhani, Sorooshian, Gupta, & Houser, 2005) . EnKF is based on Monte Carlo where the approximation of forecast (a priori) state error covariance matrix is made by propagating an ensemble of model states using the updated states (ensemble members) from the previous time step.It is quite difficult to have a real specific contact network between each person in Wuhan. Therefore, a generalized network is used, which means that every individual in this area is connected with a possibility. To describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 pneumonia, we used the discrete-time S-I-R model which categorizes the hosts within a population as susceptible (S), infectious (I) and removed (R) (Keeling & Rohani, 2011) . At any discrete time, every individual has to be in one of these 3 compartments. The susceptible are individuals unexposed to the pathogen but can be infected by contact with the infectious population. Infectious individuals can clear the infection by hospitalization, death and quarantine measures and become removed. The equations for the state transitions are shown as follows.Where β denotes the infection rate and γ denotes the removing rate. In the SIR model, we assume that the infection process of each infectious individual is Poisson and statistically independent and that the removing process for every infected individual is also Poisson. In this case, the infection rate β quantifies the probability that each susceptible individual can be infected by each infectious individual in a time unit, and the recovering rate γ quantifies the average portion of the infectious population that will clear infection in a time unit. Considering that the population flow, prevention measures (like wearing N95 mask) and selfquarantine could affect the infection rate, we take the infection rate β as a time-varying parameter. The removing rate is set as a constant 1/7 based on the estimation from Huang et al. (2020) .Let the state variables (SIR) defined as ∈ 3 , the time-varying parameter ∈ . Consider the following problemwhere and are model and observation noise which are assumed to be normally distributed and with zero mean and the covariance known.Because the true states are generally unknown, we can use the ensemble mean as the best estimate of the true state. The error covariance matrices for the predicted and filtered ensemble are given bywhere − is the error covariance matrix associated with the forecasted estimate (prior), is the one associated with the updated estimate (posterior), ̂− is the ensemble vector of the forecasted estimate from model equations.In the ensemble presentation, the model states and the time-varying parameter can be put together in a matrix ∈ 4× , holding N ensemble member at time k.The ensemble covariance then can be presented asThe measurement can also be formulated in an ensemble presentationwhere 1 = + 1 , is the true measurement and is the perturbation term. The measurement covariance matrix can be estimated asSpecify to the situation we are dealing with,and it is the same with , , and . The measurement is the total number of confirmed infected cases reported by the National Health Commission of China, which can be taken as the sum of the infectious and removed. Therefore,

Long-term analysis

In the long-term analysis, several epidemic models are built based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) compartmental model, which has been frequently used in the study of the COVID-19 (X. Read et al., 2020; J. T. Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Each node is either in one of the compartments susceptible, exposed, infectious, or removed. Susceptible nodes refer to people free of the virus and can become infected due to contact with infectious nodes. Exposed nodes have been infected by the disease, but have not yet shown symptoms or become infectious. Removed nodes represent those individuals who are recovered, isolated, hospitalized, or dead due to the disease.

Network-based approach with Markovian processes

In this section, we apply the generalized modeling framework (GEMF) proposed by Sahneh, Scoglio, & Van Mieghem (2013) to build an individual-level network model. In GEMF, each node stays in a different state, and the joint state of all nodes follow a Markov process. The node-level description of this Markov process can be expressed as follows:[ ( + Δ ) = 3| ( ) = 2, ( )] = Δ + (Δ )Where ( ) is the joint state of all individual nodes at time ; ( ) = 0, 1, 2,3 means that the state of node at time is in susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed compartment, respectively; is the number .

However, we noticed that there exists a variety regarding the epidemiological parameters. Based on 1099 patients in 31 provincial municipalities through January 29 th , 2020, Guan et al. (2020) estimated that the median incubation period was 3.0 days, ranging between 0 to 24.0 days. This median incubation period was shorter than the previous studies based on smaller sample sizes, in which the estimated time from infection to illness onset was 5-5.2 days (Gardner, 2020; Q. Li et al., 2020) . Du et al. (2020) considered the delay from symptom onset to case detection as 4-5 days. Considering the possibility of asymptomatic infections, we adopt a relatively short mean incubation period as 3 days and mean infectious period as 4 days .Hubei Province has 17 prefecture-level cities, and the population size of each city is obtained from the Hubei Statistical Yearbook (Hubei Provincial Bureau of Statistics, 2020). Based on the Baidu locationbased service data (https://qianxi.baidu.com/) and the fact that around 5 million people have moved out of Wuhan before the city lockdown on January 23 rd (Zhu et al., 2020) , the number of people that traveled between the cities in Hubei Province from January 1 st to January 29 th , 2020 is obtained.Since data about the actual people contact network inside a city are unavailable, we created contact networks among people within each city following with the homogenous network topology, namely the Erdős-Rényi model (Erdős & Rényi, 1960) . More specifically, nodes inside a city are randomly connected with a predefined probability such that each node has around 15 links (the average node degree is 15). Intercity links are created to simulate the interaction among the cities according to the number of people that traveled between the cities. For example, if the daily population flow from city to city is number of people, number of directed links will be randomly generated between people in city to people in city . Considering the implementation of city lockdown on January 23 rd , we alter the intercity network topology once during the simulation. In the first network topology, links among cities are created based on the average daily population movement between January 1 st -22 nd , while the second network reflects the population movement from January 23 rd -29 th .To fit the model, we consider the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak starting in Wuhan City from January 19 th , because all confirmed cases reported in Hubei Province were in Wuhan City before January 19 th , 2020. To reduce the computational cost, the population of each city and population flows among the cities are scaled by 198, which is the number of cumulative confirmed cases in Hubei Province up to January 19 th . After scaling, the total number of nodes in the network equals 298,838. In addition, as the criteria for counting the confirmed cases are changed on February 12 th , 2020, there is a jump in the reported number of confirmed cases in Hubei Province on February 13 th , 2020. Accordingly, by keeping = 0.33 day -1 and = 0.25 day -1 (average) unchanged, we fitted the transmission model to the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Hubei Province (Health Commission of Hubei Province, 2020), from January 19 th to February 12 th by tuning the infection rate ′ ( ). We then examine the future course of the epidemic under different scenarios.GEMF is available in MATLAB, R, Python, and C programming language (Sahneh, Vajdi, Shakeri, Fan, & Scoglio, 2017) . We performed extensive stochastic simulations by adapting the GEMF toolbox with MATLAB during the experiment. The number of simulation runs is 500 in all scenarios. We track the number of nodes in each compartment for 365 days and demonstrate the simulation results with confidence intervals..

Network-based approach with non-Markov processes

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many studies have emerged to learn how this disease spreads. However, an overwhelming majority of the epidemic models have considered Markov processes, in which the transition between compartments follows an exponential distribution. To the best of the authors' knowledge, very few works have been done incorporating non-Markovian processes to epidemic models with respect to COVID-19. In this section, we take Wuhan City as a study area and try to demonstrate how distributions of key epidemiological factors can influence the predicted trajectory of the disease spreading.More specifically, we incorporate non-exponential interevent time distributions to the SEIR model using the modified Gillespie algorithm proposed by Boguñá, Lafuerza, Toral, & Serrano (2014) . Transitions from the susceptible state to the exposed state is a Poisson process that follows the exponential distribution. Following lognormal distributions, the mean and median of the incubation period are estimated at 5.6 days and 5.0 days, respectively, while the infectious period is of mean 3.9 days and median 1.5 days , which is in line with Sanche et al. (2020) . The number of simulation runs is 80.

Results and discussion

In this section, we provide results regarding the short-term analysis with the Kalman filter. From the long-term perspective, we first present results based on GEMF stochastic simulations and then compare the results based on non-Markovian processes and Markov processes.

Short-term analysis with the Kalman filter

The predictions of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan city from February 22 nd to March 1 st were conducted. Every predictive simulation was run 250 iterations. The removing rate we used was 1/7 and the infection rate was estimated by EnKF. The model noise and measurement noise was tuned by state of art. Fig. 1 shows the distributions of the predicted numbers of COVID-19 cases based on data 1, 2 and 3 days before. The results of the EnKF prediction give two rangesthe weak one from minimum to maximum (the solid black line) which can include all the reported real data (the green circle); the stronger one from the lower quartile to the upper quartile (the blue box) which also covers most of the real numbers. The red line inside the box indicates the median of the samples. We can see that most medians are very close to the corresponding real numbers. Taking the median as our predicted number gives the relative error shown in Fig. 1(d) . The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for 1-day-ahead prediction is 0.19%; the MAPE for 2-day-ahead prediction is 0.32%; the one for 3-day-ahead is 0.62%. The performance of 1-day-ahead prediction is the best and the one of 3-day-ahead is the worst. When n-day-ahead prediction is conducted, the results from (n-1)-day-ahead is used, so the errors will accumulate..

The orange line in Fig. 3 presents the removing rate. From January 15 th to January 27 th , the infection rate β is increasing. After January 27th, β starts to decrease. The self-quarantine policy was carried out on January 23 rd in Wuhan and a series of administrative actions were taken to prevent the disease from spreading. Considering that there are several days delay from the infection to detection, the estimated β matches with the real situation. On February 12 th , because Wuhan authorities changed the case definition to include symptomatic patients in addition to tested ones, there was a huge increase in cases, which results in a huge increase in estimated infection rate β as well. Therefore, the estimated β on February 12 th is inaccurate. After February 14 th , the infection rate β is less than the removing rate γ, which means the epidemic had peaked in Wuhan..

Long-term analysis with the Markovian process

To reconstruct the epidemics in Hubei province at its early stage, we continuously tune the infection rate parameter ′ to match the number of nodes in the removed compartment with the number of cumulative confirmed cases from January 19 th to February 12 th , as shown in Fig. 4.   Fig. 4 Fitting the model to the cumulative confirmed cases from January 19 th to February 12 th .By performing GEMF stochastic simulations, we obtain that ′ is equal to 0.12 for day 0-7, and then becomes 0.027 for day 8-10, and 0.024 for day 11-18. Starting from day 19, ′ = 0.02. The infection rate dramatically drops, indicating that public health interventions implemented in Hubei Province have considerably controlled the epidemic development since the nascent stage of the outbreak.The predicted epidemic dynamics from GEMF stochastic simulations are shown in Fig. 5 . We consider four different scenarios: continuing the current trend (Scenario1); decreasing 2 by 25% (Scenario 2); reducing the average node degree inside a city from 15 to 10 (Scenario 3); reducing 2 by 25% and average node degree from 15 to 10 (Scenario 4). Preventive measures such as wearing masks can help reduce the infection rate. On the other hand, the average node degree refers to the possible contacts a person may have in daily life, and this can be reduced by contact reduction and social distancing.. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 In Fig. 5 , if the current trend as of February 12 th continues, the epidemics in Hubei Province could have become endemic and not been contained in one year. When ′ is reduced by 25% in Scenario 2, the number of infectious cases in Hubei Province would reach the peak at day 22 on average (median: 24, and fade out at around day 250 in Fig. 5(c) . Reducing the average node degree inside each city from 15 to 10, the epidemic would reach the peak at around day 21 (median: 24, and fade out at day 150 on average. When a combination of reducing ′ and average node degree is conducted in scenario 4, the number of infectious cases would reach the peak at around day 19 (median: 23, , and the number of removed cases would approximate the actual epidemic trajectory in Hubei Province in the steady-state as shown in Fig. 5 (e) .Overall, GEMF simulation results suggest that more strict prevention and control measures have been taken since February 12 th to achieve the current cumulative confirmed cases in Hubei Province. Preventive measures and social distancing measures need to be taken in combination by the government to speed up the containment of the epidemic and reduce the peak infection dramatically.(a) Scaled number of susceptible cases (b) Scaled number of exposed cases (c) Scaled number of infectious cases (d) Scaled number of removed cases .

Long-term analysis with the non-Markovian process

With mean infectious period (from compartments → ) set as 3.9 days and mean incubation period (from compartments → ) set as 5 days, we first use ordinary differential equations based on Markov processes to estimate the infection rate from compartments → . Assuming that the epidemic starts from December 1 st , is equal to 0.68 to match the number of cumulative confirmed cases in Wuhan city.Second, we simulate the disease spread in Wuhan city with transmission between compartments incorporating non-Markovian dynamics. The transition from compartment → still evolves according to an exponential distribution with = 0.68, while transitions from compartments → and → follow the lognormal distributions from Sanche et al., 2020) in Fig. 6 (a-b) . Note that the width of the infectious period becomes much shorter (blue curve) after January 18 th , as shown in Fig. 6 (a) , because the government has started to trace back and monitor those people who have contact with confirmed cases and built temporary hospitals to hospitalize both patients with mild and severe symptoms since mid-January. In Fig. 6 (a-b) , we also show curves of different exponential distributions compared with these lognormal distributions for demonstration purposes.In Fig. 6 (c-d), simulated results incorporating non-Markovian processes deviate from the results obtained from Markov processes. More specifically, the epidemic curve with non-Markovian processes is flattened with a smaller epidemic peak compared with that from Markov processes. This is because the infectious period used in the Markovian model has an exponential distribution (mean =3.9 days) similar to the shape of the exponential distribution (mean=4.0 days) in Fig. 6 (a) , but shorter than the lognormal distribution (mean=3.9 days, median=1.5 days) used after January 18 th . The reasons above indicate that control measures to reduce the infectious period can effectively mitigate the outbreak.On the other hand, these two methods with different distributions but with the same mean infectious period lead to inconsistent results. Since the actual infectious period and incubation period do not follow exponential distributions, these simulations suggest that future works need to consider distributions of epidemiological characteristics to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectory. Instead of taking mean values derived from clinical studies as input to the epidemic models, researchers need to take into account the empirically derived distribution of the parameters..

Conclusion

In this work, the ensemble Kalman filter is used to make short-term predictions of the COVID-19 cases in Wuhan City, which resulted in accurate forecasts of daily case reports. The model is able to predict daily cases and the epidemic peak. Knowing the daily cases from forecasts three days in advance allows for the proper resource allocation. The ensemble Kalman filter also allows parameter estimation, which is extremely useful for modeling purposes.From an epidemiological modeling perspective, we simulate the epidemic spreading in Wuhan city based on non-Markovian processes, and show that different distributions with the same mean infectious period can lead to inconsistency in terms of epidemic dynamics. Since most current network-based approaches are based on Markov processes, in which epidemiological parameters are assumed to follow exponential distributions, non-Markovian process-based models need to be further explored to better predict the COVID-19 spreading. Our results show that reducing the infectious period via measures such as early case identification and isolation can reduce the epidemic size significantly.In the long-term perspective, we test and confirm the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the containment of the epidemic dynamics by performing GEMF stochastic simulations.

Our simulation results indicate that the containment of this highly contagious disease was achieved by stringent control measures by the Chinese government. Without continued and aggressive control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province would have become persistent. If the infection rate is reduced through the enhanced protective measures by 25%, the epidemic would reach the peak in mid-February and fade out in late September. Reducing the average node degree inside each city via social distancing measures, the number of infectious cases would peak at mid-February and decrease to zero at mid-June. Only with combined implementation of enhanced protective measures and social distancing measures, the epidemic dynamics would peak at around mid-February and approximate the actual epidemic trajectory in March. This can be an important message for countries going through the exponential growth of the epidemic in the current days.

"Abstract

The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus infection that were confirmed outside of China provide an opportunity to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in mainland China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number-the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naïve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January, 2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% CI: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued that the current COVID-19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a pandemic. The proposed approach provides insights in early risk assessment using publicly available data.

","Introduction

Since 8 December, 2019, clusters of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology have emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [1, 2] . Virological investigation suggests that the causative agent of this pneumonia is a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) [3] . As of 27 January, 2020, a total of 4515 cases including 106 deaths were confirmed [4] . Forty-one cases of COVID-19 infections were also reported outside China, in other Asian countries, the United States, France, Australia, and Canada.A local market selling seafood and wildlife in Wuhan was visited by many cases in the initial cluster, indicating that a common-source zoonotic exposure may have been the main mode of transmission [5] . However, even after shutting down the market, the number of cases continued to grow across China and several instances of household transmission were reported [6] . It is now speculated that sustained human-to-human transmission aided in the establishment of the epidemic [7] and that reported case counts greatly underestimated the actual number of infections in China [8] .Early assessment of the severity of infection and transmissibility can help quantify the pandemic potential of COVID-19 and anticipate the likely number of deaths by the end of the epidemic. One important epidemiological measure of severity is case fatality risk (CFR), which can be measured with three different approaches, by estimating (i) the proportion of the cumulative number of deaths out of the cumulative number of cases at a point in time, (ii) the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the cumulative number of infected individuals whose clinical outcome is known (i.e., the deceased or recovered), and (iii) the risk of death among confirmed cases, explicitly accounting for the time from illness onset to death [9] . Estimating the CFR using the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases (cCFR), with an adjustment of the time delay from illness onset to death (i.e., method (iii)), can provide insight into severity of the disease, because the naïve CFR based on method (i) tends to be underestimated due to the real-time nature of the growth of fatal cases. For example, during the early stage of an epidemic, failing to right-censor cases with respect to the time delay from illness onset to death may lead to underestimation of the CFR. This is because death due to infection may yet occur following case identification [9] [10] [11] .When the CFR denominator only includes confirmed cases it is referred to as the cCFR [10] and may overestimate the actual CFR among all infected individuals due to under-ascertainment of infections in the population. Nonetheless, the cCFR is still a valuable measure of the upper bound of the symptomatic CFR (sCFR) among all symptomatic cases, particularly in circumstances of high uncertainty, such as the emergence of a new human pathogen (i.e., .The basic reproduction number ( 0 ), the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a fully susceptible population, represents an epidemiological measurement of the transmissibility, helping us to quantify the pandemic potential of COVID-19. Here, we define a pandemic as the worldwide spread of a newly emerged disease, in which the number of simultaneously infected individuals exceeds the capacity for treatment [12] . Using the growth rate of the estimated cumulative incidence from exportation cases and accounting for the time delay from illness onset to death, the present study aims to estimate the cCFR of COVID-19 in real-time.

Epidemiological Data

Information on exported COVID-19 cases who were confirmed in other countries and deaths due to COVID-19 infection in China were retrieved from the first announcement date of the current outbreak (i.e., 31 December, 2019) through 24 January, 2020. The cutoff time of 24 January, 2020 was specifically selected to reflect the governmental ban on public transportation from Wuhan (including flights) which was invoked on 23 January, 2020 [13] . All data were collected either from government websites or from media quoting government announcements. Our data include 51 cases diagnosed outside China who had illness onset through 24 January, 2020 and were reported by 9 February, 2020 and the dates of illness onset and death among 41 deceased cases in China.

Estimation of the Delay Distributions

The observed incidence i(t) by date of illness onset t is modeled using an exponential growth model with the rate r: ( ) = 0 , where i0 is the expected number of infected cases at time t = 0. The cumulative incidence I(t) is an integral of i(t) over the time interval from zero to t that can be written as ( ) = ∫ ( )d 0 = 0 ( − 1)/ . The cumulative incidence is adjusted to the date of report by the factor u dependent on the parameters of the delay distribution. For the estimation of time delay distribution from illness onset to death, we accounted for right truncation and modeled and used a lognormal distribution with parameters adopted from an earlier study [14] . Let ( ; ) be the lognormal distribution with parameters = { , }. Then, the cumulative incidence I(t) by date of report t can be adjusted to the time from illness onset to death and report by simply multiplying it by the factor ( , ), which is a consequence of the exponentially growing epidemic [10] . The factor u is defined by the following integral: Let and be the shape and inverse scale of the gamma distribution modeling the distribution of time interval from illness onset to the report for observed exported cases. The cumulative incidence in China can be then adjusted by the multiplicative factor ̃( , = { , }). The number of exported cases E(t) can then be sampled from another Binomial distribution:where p describes the probability of finding a traveler from Wuhan among all travelers from China subject to the detection time window of the virus T = 12.5 days [8] . Given that the total volume of inbound passengers from China is M = 5.56 million passengers per year, the fraction of Wuhan travelers is = 0.021%, and the population of Wuhan is n = 11 million, the probability p is given by

Statistical Inference

First, we fitted the delay distribution of the time from illness onset to report Δ , ( ≤ ) to the gamma distribution. We define the log-likelihood as follows:( | Δ , ) = ∑ log(gamma(Δ , | shape = , scale = )that is maximized to find the mean values of the parameters ̃= {̃,̃}, used in the following step. Second, we fitted the observed counts of exported cases and deaths by considering two other likelihoods respectively to each process: where and are the times at which the first exportation event and the first death are observed. The total log-likelihood is given by the sum of two log-likelihoods:which is then maximized to determine the best-fit parameters { , 0 , ( )}. We considered two possible scenarios to fit to the data. In the first scenario (refers to ""Scenario 1""), the parameter 0 is fixed at one on the date of illness onset for the first COVID-19 confirmed case (i.e., 8 December, 2019), providing a fixed starting point for the exponential growth of the cumulative incidence. Although 8 December, 2019 is assumed as the starting point for exponential growth of the cumulative incidence in Scenario 1, there is still uncertainty using this date as a proxy for the beginning of exponential growth due to inconsistencies reported on illness onset for the earliest reported cases [2, 5] . Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis where the start date for exponential growth was varied between 1 December and 10 December, 2019. In the second scenario (refers to ""Scenario 2""), all parameters { , 0 , ( )} are variable, and calculation begins on the date the first exported case was observed (i.e., 13 January, 2020). For both scenarios, we conducted sensitivity analyses that estimated the growth rate, cumulative incidence, and cCFR value using different cut-off times, values of the detection window T, and sizes of the catchment population of the Wuhan International airport n.The value of the basic reproduction number 0 for the COVID-19 epidemic was calculated aswhere r is the estimated growth rate for each scenario and S is the mean serial interval for successive COVID-19 infections. The value of the serial interval was adopted from a published study [2] , and a gamma distribution was fitted to six known pairs of the infectee and infector (mean = 7.5 days, standard deviation (SD) = 3.4 days).In our analysis, we employed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations with eight chains of 4250 samples each, with 2500 samples used for the tuning stage, leveraging the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) part of the Python PyMC3 package. However, one of the input variables for the Binomial distribution ̃( , ) ⋅ ( ) or ( , ) ⋅ ( ) was modeled with a continuous variable in our approach. We used the gamma distribution, matching the first two moments to obtain the transformation of the discrete Binomial distribution to its continuous approximation [16] . We avoided joint estimation of all parameters { Σ , , } due to heterogeneity in the aggregated data-a similar issue is discussed in [10] . Instead, we implemented a sequential fitting: first we considered only the likelihood , then we fit the likelihood Σ using the mean values of the estimated parameters obtained in the previous round. Finally, we verified the obtained fit by calculating pointwise estimates using maximum likelihood estimation with confidence intervals derived as profile likelihood-based intervals. We found that both approaches were at complete agreement in their results.

Results

Figures 1A,B show the mean and SD of the time from illness onset to reporting and death, respectively. Employing the gamma distribution, the mean time from illness onset to reporting was estimated at 7.1 days (95% CI: 5.9, 8.4). The mean time from illness onset to death-adopted from a previous study [14] -was estimated at 20.2 days (95% CI: 15.1, 29.5), which led to the lognormal distribution with location parameter of 2.84 and scale parameter of 0.52. .

The values for distribution of time from illness onset to death are adopted from an earlier study [14] . The blue bars show empirically observed data collected from governmental reports (as of 24 January, 2020).Subsequently, the cumulative incidence was estimated from exported case data by fitting an exponentially growing incidence curve for both Scenarios 1 and 2 ( Figure 2 ). As of 24 January, 2020, 20 exported cases were reported, and the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 6924 cases (95% CI: 4885, 9211) in Scenario 1 and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158) in Scenario 2. Table 1 shows the real-time update of the estimated cumulative incidence. The exponential growth rates (r), derived from the growth rate of cumulative incidence, were estimated at 0.15 per day (95% CI: 0.14, 0.15) and 0.29 per day (95% CI: 0.22, 0.36) in Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. and 2D show the estimated cCFR value accounting for the time delay from illness onset to death under Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively.

Assuming that the mean serial interval was 7.5 days [2] , the basic reproduction number was estimated at 2.10 (95% CI: 2.04, 2.16) and 3.19 (95% CI: 2.66, 3.69) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. However, as the mean serial interval varies, the estimates can range from 1.6 to 2.6 and 2.2 to 4.2 for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. To address the uncertainty in the unobserved date of illness onset of the index case in Scenario 1, cCFR was estimated by varying the starting date of the exponential growth in the incidence by placing the single index case between 1 and 10 December, 2019 ( Figure S1 and Table S1 ). When we assumed the date of illness onset of the index case was 1 December, 2019, the estimated incidence in China and the cCFR on 24 January, 2020 were estimated at 4718 (95% CI: 3328, 6278) and 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5, 7.6).

Discussion

The present study estimated the risk of death among confirmed cases while addressing ascertainment bias by using data from cases diagnosed outside mainland China and a right-censored likelihood for modeling the count of deceased cases. The estimated cCFR value was 5.3% [3.5, 7.5] when the date of illness onset for the index case was fixed a priori at 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), and 8.4% [5.3, 12 .3%] when the timing of the exponential growth of epidemic was fitted to data alongside with other model parameters (Scenario 2). The estimated value of u in Scenario 2, which adjusts the time delay from illness onset to death, was smaller than that in Scenario 1 due to the larger value of the growth rate of incidence, while the estimated cCFR value as of 24 January, 2020 was larger in Scenario 2 compared with Scenario 1. Depending on the available data, the estimate of the cCFR (i.e., the delay-adjusted risk of death among confirmed cases) may vary in time and show some fluctuations. In addition to that, we estimated the value of the basic reproduction number 0 in the range of 1.6-2.6 for Scenario 1 and 2.2-4.2 for Scenario 2. From either estimate, we conclude that COVID-19 has substantial potential to spread via human-to-human transmission. However, R0 > 1 does not guarantee that a single exported (and untraced) case would immediately lead to a major epidemic in the destination country as government responses such as border control, isolation of suspected cases, and intensive surveillance should serve to reduce opportunities for transmission to occur [17] [18] [19] .Our cCFR estimates of 5.3% and 8.4% indicate that the severity of COVID-19 is not as high as that of other diseases caused by coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had an estimated CFR of 17% in Hong Kong [9, 10, 20] , and Middle East respiratory syndrome, which had an estimated CFR of 20% in South Korea [21] . Nonetheless, considering the overall magnitude of the ongoing epidemic, a 5%-8% risk of death is by no means insignificant. In addition to quantifying the overall risk of death, future research must identify groups at risk of death (e.g., the elderly and people with underlying comorbidities) [22, 23] . Moreover, considering that about 9% of all infected individuals are ascertained and reported [24] , the infection fatality risk (IFR), i.e., the risk of death among all infected individuals, would be on the order of 0.5% to 0.8%.Our estimated 0 range of 1.6-4.2 for COVID-19 is consistent with other preliminary estimates posted on public domains [25-28], and is comparable to the 0 of SARS, which was in the range of 2-5 during the 2003 outbreak in Singapore [15] . Between our two estimates, the latter scenario yielded a greater value than the former, and there was an increasingly improved ascertainment in early January 2020. The virus was identified and sequenced on 7 January, 2020 and subsequently, the primer was widely distributed, allowing for rapid laboratory identification of cases and contributing to a time-dependent increase in the number of confirmed cases out of China. Consequently, Scenario 2, which was fully dependent on the growth rate of exported cases, could have overestimated the intrinsic growth rate of cases. Considering the estimated value of 0 , the possibility of presymptomatic transmission in the ongoing epidemic is a critical question, as it would have a substantial impact on public health response to the epidemic (e.g., whether the contact tracing should be prioritized or not) as well as overall predictability of the epidemic during the containment stage [29, 30] .From the technical side, it should be emphasized that our proposed approach can be especially useful during the early stage of an epidemic when local surveillance is affected by substantial ascertainment bias and export and death data are available and better ascertained. Nonetheless, caution must be used when implementing similar estimations for the COVID-19 epidemic, as all flights from Wuhan airport were grounded as of 23 January, 2020 [13] and this intervention abruptly changed the human migration network. Despite the decrease in the outbound flow of travelers from Wuhan, there is a substantial risk that the next epidemic wave will originate from other cities.There are five main limitations in the present study. First, our results present an estimate for the cCFR which only addresses fatality among confirmed cases. More precise IFR estimate that includes infected individuals other than confirmed cases can only be estimated using additional pieces of data (e.g., seroepidemiological data or outpatient clinic visits). It should be noted that not only the denominator but also numerator values are also subject for better estimation (e.g. excess mortality estimate). Second, our study relied on limited empirical data that were extracted from publicly available data sources. Thus, future studies with greater sample size and precision are needed. Nonetheless, we believe that this study will improve the situational assessment of the ongoing epidemic. Third, our assumed date of illness onset for the index case in Scenario 1 is based on initial reports of the earliest onset date for a case, and the continued exponential growth with the rate r is the authors' extrapolation. However, we conducted a sensitivity analysis and ensured that the resulting statistical estimates would not greatly vary from our main results. Fourth, there is an uncertainty in the detection window time T. Since the epidemiological investigations are being actively implemented outside China, we believe that the sum of the incubation period and the infectious period can be a plausible estimation of the detection time window. Fifth, heterogeneous aspects of death (e.g. age and risk groups) need to be addressed in the future studies.In conclusion, the present study has estimated cCFR to be on the order of 5%-8% and R0 to be 1.6-4.2, endorsing the notion that COVID-19 infection in the ongoing epidemic possesses the potential to become a pandemic. The proposed approach can also help direct risk assessment in other settings with the use of publicly available datasets.

"Abstract

The scientific community is focussed on developing antiviral therapies to 25 mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected 27 hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load 28 data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal / 29 sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in 30 the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV 31 infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics 32 are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe 33 cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of 34 MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 35 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, 36 we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs 37 that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of 38 viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus 39 production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which 40 occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that 41 promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects. Our unique mathematical 42 approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which 43 are useful for development of antiviral therapies. 44 Keywords: 45 SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, mathematical model, antiviral therapy 46 All rights reserved.

","Characterising SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infections by analysing viral load 79 measurements collected from throat swabs 80

We analysed data describing SARS-CoV-2 viral loads reported by Zou et al. 81 (1) and MERS-CoV viral loads reported by Oh et al. (8) using a simple mathematical 82 model (see Methods). To consider inter-individual variations in viral loads, a 83 nonlinear mixed-effect modelling approach was employed to estimate parameters 84 (see Methods). The estimated parameters and initial values are listed in Table 1 , 85 and the typical behaviour of the model using these best-fit parameter estimates is 86shown together with the data in Fig. 1A for SARS-CoV-2 (pink) and MERS-CoV 87 (black and grey for severe and mild case, respectively). In addition, to parameterise 88 and compare these coronaviruses infections, we calculated the following important 89 quantities ( Fig. 2) using estimated parameter values; the mean length of virus 90 production of an infected cell ( = 1/ ), the within-host basic reproduction number 91 ( 0 = / ) which is the average number of newly infected cells produced by any 92 single infected cell (9), and the critical inhibition rate ( * = 1 − 1/ 0 ) induced by 93 antivirals to prevent primary virus infection (10, 11) . We showed that is not 94 significantly different for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. However, interestingly, we 95 found that 0 and * for SARS-CoV-2 are significantly different from analogous 96 values for mild cases of MERS-CoV ( = 8.9 × 10 −4 and 2.0 × 10 −6 by the bootstrap 97 t-test, respectively), but not for severe MERS-CoV ( = 0.41 and 0.41) (see Fig. 2) , 98 although we were unable to separate mild and severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 due to 99 limited clinical information for the cases. This demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 100 causes infection more effectively than in mild cases of MERS-CoV, but a general 101 SARS-CoV-2 infection follows infection dynamics that are similar to severe cases 102 due to MERS-CoV. In addition, as a median estimate, 65% inhibition of the initial 103 virus expansion is required to prevent the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 infection 104 (we provide a detailed analysis later). We also calculated the duration of infection in 105 which the viral load is above the detection limit ( ) in Table 1 , showing that SARS-106CoV-2 is maintained in hosts for more than a week based on the median estimate. 107 108

Characterising SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections by analysing viral load 109 measurements collected from nasopharyngeal/sputum/tracheal aspirate 110

To extend our analysis to include SARS-CoV, we analysed SARS-CoV viral 111 loads in nasopharyngeal aspirate reported by Peiris et al. (12) and MERS-CoV viral 112 loads reported by Oh et al. (8) in sputum or tracheal aspirate. The estimated 113 parameters, viral load at symptom onset, and the indices derived from the estimated 114 parameters are listed in Table 1 and from bootstrap t-test) (Fig. 2) . This demonstrates that in vivo viral dynamics of 121 SARS-CoV infection are similar to those for MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in 122 severe cases. Collectively, the findings from the viral load data analyses for the two 123 different specimens (throat/nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal/sputum/tracheal 124 aspirate) implied that SARS-CoV-2 also causes infection more effectively than 125

Evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies 128

Our quantitative analyses provide insights into optimal usage of anti-SARS-129 (Fig. 3) . 136

(i) Blocking de novo infection 138

One of the major mechanisms of action for antivirals is blocking de novo 139infections. This can be induced by drugs including human neutralising antibodies, 140 viral entry-inhibitors and/or antibodies raised by vaccination (13, 14) . For example, a 141 SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody has been reported to cross react 142 with SARS-CoV-2 (14). We conducted in silico experiments with varying drug 143 efficacy (considering inhibition rates from 10% to 100%, i.e. 0.1 ≤ ≤ 1) and with the 144 timing of initiation of therapy from 0 days (i.e., post-exposure prophylactic use of 145 antivirals) until 5 days after symptom onset (i.e., 0 ≤ * ≤ 5) (see Methods). Our 146 results show that early initiation of therapy (especially within two to three days) with 147 even a relatively weak drug (inhibition rates as low as 50%) might effectively reduce 148 the area under the curve of viral load (AUC) and prevent significant reductions in the 149 numbers of target cells because of cytopathic effects due to cell invasion. A therapy 150 of this type initiated four days after symptom onset, on the other hand, is not 151 predicted to induce a clear antiviral effect (Fig. 3AD) . This suggests that blocking de 152 novo infections is not likely to be effective unless the intervention is initiated before 153 the peak viral load. Hence, appropriate initiation timing (i.e., before or very soon after 154 symptom onset) is an important factor for suppressing viral load in addition to the 155 therapy having the potential for antiviral effects. 156

(ii) Blocking virus production 158

The majority of antiviral drugs inhibit intracellular virus replication. Although 159 their antiviral efficacies need to be confirmed, lopinavir/ritonavir (HIV protease 160 inhibitors), remdesivir (anti-Ebola virus disease candidate) and other nucleoside 161 analogues, and interferon have the potential to suppress SARS-CoV-2 by blocking 162 virus production (15, 16) . Interestingly, our results suggest that, even for relatively 163 small inhibition rates of around 30%, the AUC of viral load is partially reduced if 164 therapy is initiated early (within three days after symptom onset) (Fig. 3BE) . 165However, if treatment is applied after the peak viral load, even drugs with 100% 166 inhibition rate are not able to reduce viral loads, which is similar to the predicted 167 outcomes of de novo blocking therapy. 168 169 (iii) Promoting cytotoxicity 170Another possible antiviral mechanism is cytotoxic effects by adaptive 171 immunity including those mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here, we assume 172 that promoting cytotoxicity increases the virus death rate by at most two times (i.e., 173 0.1 ≤ ≤ 1), that is, achieves up to 50% reduction of the mean length of virus 174 production. Compared with the other two therapies (blocking de novo infection and 175virus production), the induction of cytotoxicity had relatively mild effects on the AUC 176 reduction if initiated before peak viral load. However, cytotoxicity induction initiated 177 after peak viral load could effectively reduce the viral load AUC (Fig. 3CF) . This 178 implies that there is an optimal time to apply this therapy, and that significant antiviral 179 effects are expected unless the promoting rate is too low or therapy is initiated either 180 too early or too late. However, large reductions of target cells due to ongoing de 181 novo infection cannot be avoided even with very early initiation (i.e., immediately 182 after symptom onset) of the therapy. 183 All rights reserved.

There are a number of potential transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2, 185 including direct person-to-person transmission due to viral particle inhalation and 186 contact transmission due to contact with nasal/oral/eye mucuous membranes. The virus production effectively reduces AUC of SARS-CoV-2 load; for example, if the 193 therapy can reduce more than 90% of de novo infections and is initiated 3 days after 194 symptoms onset, the viral load AUC is expected to be reduced by 81.4% (Fig. 3DE) . 195However, if therapy is initiated after peak viral load (more than 2-3 days following 196 symptom onset), the effect on viral load AUC is limited. Compared with either 197 blocking de novo infection or virus production, promoting cytotoxicity showed 198 relatively mild effects on AUC reduction, however initiation of that therapy after the 199 peak viral load has the potential to still reduce viral load AUC (Fig. 3F) . 200The effectiveness of the hypothetical drugs can be evaluated in detail using a 201 reported for SARS-CoV-2, a number of animal models exist for SARS-CoV including 206 mice, hamsters, ferrets, and macaques (17).

Such viral 209 load data would allow further investigation of the effectiveness of drugs with different 210 action mechanisms, which would be informative for development of appropriate 211 treatment strategies (i.e., the optimal dose/timing of antivirals) for SARS-CoV-2 212

infections. 213

In conclusion, effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections requires an 214 appropriate choice of class-specific drugs; otherwise, the antivirals do not alter the 215 viral load significantly and are wasted. Identification of SARS-CoV-2-specific virus 216 characteristics is needed to design optimal treatments and to ensure that limited 217 resources are deployed effectively. Additionally, effective combinations of anti-218 SARS-CoV-2 drugs and vaccines will maximise the impacts of control, reduce the 219 required drug dose and potentially limit side effects, all of which are highly desirable. 220Our theoretical approach could complement ongoing experimental investigations into 221

To our knowledge, previous studies have neither characterised SARS-223CoV-2 dynamics in humans using viral dynamics models, nor compared the resulting 224 dynamics against those of other coronaviruses (i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). 225Our mathematical modelling approach has led to an improved understanding of the 226 characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo, and can be used to test possible treatments 227 for COVID-19 further going forwards. 228 All rights reserved.

Study data 230

The data examined in our manuscript came from studies of SARS-CoV-2, 231 MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV by Zou et al. (1) , Oh et al. (8) and Peiris et al. (12) , 232 respectively. To extract the data from images in those publications, we used the 233 program datathief III (version 1.5, Bas Tummers, www.datathief.org). We excluded 234 patients for whom data were measured on only one day, and assumed that viral load 235 values under the detection limit were set as the detection limit for the purposes of 236 fitting the model. We converted cycle threshold (Ct) values reported in Zou et al. (1) , 237Oh et al. (8) and Peiris et al. (12) to viral RNA copies number values, where these 238 quantities are inversely proportional to each other (18). 239 240

In silico experiments for possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies 275

By utilising our novel mathematical model and the estimated parameter 276 values, we investigated the antiviral effects of unlicensed but developing (promising) 277 drugs with the following different mechanisms of action, depending on inhibition rates 278 and timings of therapy initiation: (i) blocking de novo infection (e.g. via human 279 neutralising antibodies, viral entry-inhibitors and antibody levels raised by 280vaccination (13, 14)); (ii) blocking virus production (such as lopinavir/ritonavir (HIV 281 protease inhibitors), remdesivir (an anti-Ebola virus candidate) and other nucleoside 282 analogues, and interferon (15, 16) CoV-2 therapy, the median parameter sets were used to predict the expected 286 outcome of each therapy. In other words, even though no drug administration trials 287 have been conducted yet, we were able to infer the efficacy of each drug treatment 288 based on our in silico experiments. We implemented the different mechanisms of 289 action in the model as follows: 290 (i) Blocking de novo infection.

"Abstract

Scintillators exhibit visible luminescence, called scintillation, when irradiated with X-rays. Given that X-rays penetrate through biological tissues, X-ray-induced scintillation would enable remote optogenetic control of neural functions at any depths in the brain. Here we show that a yellow-emitting inorganic scintillator, Ce-doped Gd3(Al,Ga)5O12 (Ce:GAGG), can effectively activate red-shifted excitatory and inhibitory opsins. Using these scintillator-opsin combinations, we successfully activated and inhibited midbrain dopamine neurons of freely moving mice by X-ray irradiation, producing bi-directional modulation of place preference behavior. The Ce:GAGG crystal was biocompatible and could be implanted for a long period without progressive neuroinflammatory responses. Neither brain injury nor behavioral dysfunction was acutely induced by radiation during the behavioral tests. Thus, X-ray-induced scintillation allows wireless control of cellular functions in living animals, expanding X-ray applications to functional studies of biology and medicine.

","

We first sought opsins that could be effectively activated by the PL of Ce:GAGG. DNA plasmids encoding different opsins were transfected into HEK 293 cells and photocurrents induced by PL illumination were measured (Fig. 1C) . For depolarizing opsins, the yellow PL of Ce:GAGG (1.8 mW/cm 2 ) elicited the largest photocurrents in cells expressing the red-shifted opsin bReaChES (13) (340.3 ± 43.1 pA, n = 12; Fig. 1D ). Regarding inhibitory opsins, the anion channelrhodopsin GtACR1 (14) showed the strongest activation (627.2 ± 80.2 pA, n = 12; Fig. 1E ) in response to the PL of Ce:GAGG (1.8 mW/cm 2 ). PL-irradiation of GFP-expressing cells induced undetectable currents (Fig. 1 , D and E). Thus, Ce:GAGG PL can activate red-shifted opsins that are used for optogenetic control of neurons. Furthermore, the yellow PL of Ce:GAGG could also induce significant activation of enzyme rhodopsin BeGC1 (15) (fig. S3 ), suggesting that the scintillation of Ce:GAGG can be used for activation of various light-sensitive proteins.We next tested the ability of Ce:GAGG PL to actuate neuronal membrane potentials in vitro. Credependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors were injected into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of DAT-IRES-Cre mice to induce the specific expression of bReaChES in dopamine (DA) neurons ( Fig. 2A and fig. S4 ). In acute slice preparations, 1-s pulses of the yellow PL of Ce:GAGG elicited depolarizing photocurrents in DA neurons in a PL intensity-dependent manner ( Fig. 2B ) Irradiation with 13.5 µW/cm 2 elicited action potentials in a fraction (2 out of 6) of DA neurons, and the rate of PL-evoked spikes was plateaued at approximately 40 µW/cm 2 (Fig. 2 , C and D). With a higher PL intensity (2.0 mW/cm 2 ), time-locked spiking up to 20 Hz could be induced with shorter (2 ms) pulses ( fig. S5 ). In DA neurons expressing inhibitory soma-targeted GtACR1 (16) (stGtACR1; fig. S4 ), hyperpolarizing photocurrents were induced by Ce:GAGG PL illumination, which attenuated action potential generation at 13.5 µW/cm 2 and maximally suppressed spiking at >30 µW/cm 2 PL (Fig. 2, F and G) . Thus, the Ce:GAGG crystal combined with bReaChES and stGtACR1 can serve as bi-directional optogenetic actuators.Having identified scintillator-opsin combinations that modulate neuronal activity, we next examined the ability of X-ray-induced RL of the Ce:GAGG crystal to activate dissociated hippocampal neurons. The intensity of the RL emitted by the Ce:GAGG crystal was proportional to the intensity of X-rays (Fig. 3A ). X-ray irradiation for total 10 min (20 s pluses every 1 min, 30 times) induced c-Fos expression among bReaChES-expressing neurons only in the presence of Ce:GAGG crystals, but not under control conditions (Fig. 3 , B to D), suggesting that the RL of Ce:GAGG can activate bReaChES-expressing neurons. Before the scintillation-mediated optogenetics is adapted to living animals, the biocompatibility of the scintillator was assessed. The vast majority of dissociated hippocampal neurons around the Ce:GAGG crystal in the culture dish survived for 7 days (Fig. 3E) , and a fraction of neurites extended toward the crystal (Fig. 3E) . Similarly, HEK 293 cells cultured in the presence of the Ce:GAGG crystal proliferated at a normal rate ( fig. S6 ). Furthermore, rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystals (size: 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 1.0−1.5 mm) implanted into the brain for four weeks did not cause activation of glial cells beyond that caused by biocompatible optic fibers ( Fig. 3F and fig. S7 ). Thus, the Ce:GAGG crystal is biocompatible and could be implanted without cytotoxicity.We finally tested whether scintillation-mediated actuation of neurons in vivo could induce behavioral changes. Transient activation and inhibition of DA neurons in the VTA is sufficient for behavioral conditioning (17) (18) (19) . We therefore induced the expression of excitatory bReaChES or inhibitory stGtACR1 in VTA-DA neurons through viral injections, and bilaterally implanted rodshaped Ce:GAGG crystals over the VTA (Fig. 4A) . The conditioned place preference (CPP) test was performed by placing the mice into a test chamber with two compartments, only one of which was irradiated by X-rays ( Fig. 4B and fig. S8 ). The initial place preference was not different among opsin-expressing and GFP-expressing control mice (Fig. 4C ). After two days of conditioning, however, mice expressing bReaChES had a significantly greater tendency to spend more time in the X-ray conditioned compartment (Fig. 4, D and E, and fig.  S9 ), whereas those expressing stGtACR1 spent significantly less time in the conditioned compartment (Fig. 4 , D and E). Control mice did not change place preference after conditioning (Fig.  4, D and E, and fig. S9 ). These opsin-expressing mice did not show any difference in the body weight, spontaneous locomotor and rearing behaviors compared to control mice ( fig. S10 ). Xirradiation of an implanted Ce:GAGG crystal did not affect the temperature of the ambient tissue ( fig.  S2 ).Thus, scintillation-mediated remote optogenetics can be used for bi-directional neuronal actuation deep in the brain of mice, resulting in behavioral changes.Neuronal precursor cells are the most radiosensitive cells in the brain (20, 21) . Acute irradiation of mice with high-dose X-rays (9 Gy) induced apoptotic cell death among putative neuronal precursor cells as detected with active caspase-3 immunoreactivity ( Fig. 4F and fig. S11 ). However, we hardly observed apoptotic signals in the brain irradiated with fractionated X-ray irradiations in our test chamber which are essentially the same as those during the CPP test ( Fig. 4F and fig. S11 ). Moreover, 10-min X-irradiation of mice in our test chamber did not cause abnormality in the homecage behavior (fig. S12). Thus, the fractionated Xray irradiation during the behavioral testing might not induce acute neuronal dysfunction.We have here demonstrated the feasibility of a novel, scintillation-mediated optogenetic technology that allows fully wireless control of neuronal activity in behaving animals. The scintillator crystal was biocompatible and safely implantable for long periods. Thermal effects on neuronal activity were negligible using this technology, a significant advantage over conventional (22, 23) and NIR-mediated (9, 10) optogenetics. Given the deep tissue penetration of X-rays ( Fig.  1A) , scintillation-mediated optogenetics can be readily applied to larger animals including monkeys. Future innovations and technical advances, such as minimizing the size of the implanted scintillator crystals, or reducing the dose of X-rays through the use of pulsed and targeted X-ray irradiation, should further enable manipulation of neuronal functions with less invasiveness.Since its discovery in the late 19th century (24), X-rays have been widely used for medical imaging and cancer therapy. However, X-rays have never been used for controlling physiological functions of cells in living animals, as we have shown here. The development of scintillation-mediated optogenetics thus expands the range of X-ray applications to functional studies of biology and medicine. Biomedical technologies that use visible light for genome editing (25) or cancer therapy (26) would benefit from wireless application to deeper tissues, which is now possible with scintillation-mediated approaches.

Materials and Methods

Scintillator crystal preparation The single crystal Ce:GAGG was synthesized using the conventional Czochralski method in Furukawa11,12. For luminescence measurements and all experiments except for implantation in the brain, the crystal was fabricated into 3−8 mm rectangular blocks 0.5−1 mm thick. For implanting the crystals in the mouse brain, rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystals (0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 3.0 mm) obtained from Furukawa were cut into smaller pieces (0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 1.0−1.5 mm) using a laser cutter and then slightly filed to round off the corners.

Luminescence measurements

The PL of a Ce:GAGG crystal was induced with 365-nm UV light (LEDMOD V2, Omicron; LC-L2, Hamamatsu) unless otherwise noted. The PL intensity for electrophysiological recordings was routinely measured with a photodiode sensor (1 cm × 1 cm; PD300-1W, Ophir) placed over the recording chamber through a UV-cut filter fabricated from UV-cut goggles (SSUV 297, AS ONE) on each experimental day. In experiments using acute slices, the PL intensity over the slice in the recording chamber was measured. The intensity of unfiltered UV light over the recording chamber was <0.1 µW/cm 2 . The RL power of a Ce:GAGG crystal was measured with a fiber-coupled photoreceiver (Newport 2151) through an optical fibre (tip diameter: 200 µm) placed close to a Ce:GAGG crystal exposed to X-ray irradiation in an X-ray machine (MX-160Labo, mediXtec). The photoreceiver current, which was sampled using an analogue-digital converter (Picoscope 4262, Pico Technology), was calibrated against the PL power measured by the photodiode sensor and converted to luminescence intensity (in watts). PL emission spectra under UV illumination (340 ± 10 nm, LAX-103, Asahi Spectra) were measured using a spectrometer (QE-Pro, Ocean Optics). RL emission spectra under X-ray irradiation (70 kV, 1 mA) were measured through an optical fibre using a CCD spectrometer (DU-420-BU2, Andor) (12).

Animals

All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Physiological Society of Japan and approved by the institutional review board of the Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Nagoya University, Japan. Adult C57BL6/J mice and DAT-IRES-Cre mice (27) (B6.SJL-Slc6a3 tm1.1(cre)Bkmn /J, The Jackson Laboratory) of both sexes were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle (lights were turned on at 8:00 am), with free access to food and water. DAT-IRES-Cre mice were maintained as homogenic mutants. Only 11−18-week-old male DAT-IRES-Cre mice were used for the CPP experiments.

Plasmids

For expression in HEK293 cells, all plasmids encoding opsins and fluorescent proteins were constructed by subcloning into an empty pCMV vector unless otherwise noted. pCMV-PsChR-Venus and pCMV-C1V1-Venus were obtained from H. Yawo (Tohoku University). bReaChES-TS-eYFP was isolated from pAAV-CaMKIIa-DIO-bReaChes-TS-eYFP gifted by K. Deisseroth (Stanford University). A full-length gene encoding BeGC1 (accession number KF309499) was synthesized after human codon optimization and inserted into the peGFP-N1 vector. For expression in primary cultured neurons, the bReaChES-TS-eYFP fragment was subcloned into an empty pCAG vector. For AAV production, pAAV-Ef1a-DIO-bReaChes-TS-eYFP was obtained from K. Deisseroth (Stanford University) and pAAV-hSyn1-SIO-stGtACR1-FusionRed was obtained from Addgene (#105678).Cell culture and transfection For electrophysiological recordings in cultured cells, expression vector plasmids encoding opsins or hrGFP were transfected into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 3-4 hours after transfection, and then seeded on a coverslip (12 mm diameter) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained in the medium in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO 2 /95% air for 24−36 hours before recordings.Dissociated hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic (E17.5) mice. Isolated hippocampal tissues were incubated with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1% DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.5% trypsin for 10 min at 37°C, and then washed three times with HBSS. The tissues were then dispersed by pipetting in Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After removing aggregated cells by filtration, the hippocampal cells were seeded on a coverslip (12 mm diameter) coated with poly-L-lysine in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The culture medium was subsequently replaced by Neurobasal medium supplemented with 0.5 mM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2% (vol/vol) B-27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. After 2 days in vitro (DIV 2), DNA plasmids carrying bReaChES-eYFP (1 µg/dish) or hrGFP (1 µg/dish) were transfected into cultured neurons using Lipofectamine 2000. The cultured neurons were maintained in the medium in an incubator at 34°C with 5% CO 2 and 95% air.Viral production For AAV production, HEK293 cells were transfected with vector plasmids including pAAV encoding an opsin, .

After three days, transfected cells were collected and suspended in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0). After four freeze-thaw cycles, the cell lysate was treated with 250 U/ml benzonase nuclease (Merck) and 1 mM MgCl 2 for 10−15 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. AAV was then purified from the supernatant by iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation. The purified AAV solution was concentrated in PBS via filtration and stored at −80°C.In vitro X-ray irradiation test Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 µM) was applied to the primary hippocampal culture by adding a stock solution of TTX to the culture media at DIV 9, and the culture dishes were maintained at 34°C with 5% CO 2 and 95% air for 24 h. At DIV 10, the culture media was replaced with TTX-free Neurobasal media, and then the dishes were placed over Ce:GAGG crystals and irradiated with X-rays (150 kV, 3 mA, 1.35 Gy/min, 20 sec, every 1 min, 30 times) at room temperature (RT). The dishes were then maintained at 34°C with 5% CO 2 and 95% air. At 2 h after X-ray irradiation, the cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at RT, and then rinsed with PBS.GloSensor assay HEK293 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing L-glutamine and phenol red (Wako) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and penicillinstreptomycin. The cells were co-transfected with the BeGC1 plasmid and the pGloSensor-42F cGMP vector (Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fischer Scientific). After transfection, 0.5 µM all-trans-retinal (Toronto Research Chemicals) was added to the culture medium. Before measurements, the culture medium was replaced with a CO 2 -independent medium containing 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 2% (vol/vol) GloSensor cGMP stock solution (Promega). The cells were then incubated for 2 h at 27°C in the dark. Intracellular cGMP levels were measured by monitoring luminescence intensity using a microplate reader (Corona Electric) at 27°C (28).Stereotactic surgery AAV-Ef1a-DIO-bReaChes-TS-eYFP (titer: 6.0 × 10 13 copies/ml), AAV-hSyn1-SIO-stGtACR1-FusionRed (titer: 1.1 × 10 13 copies/ml) or AAV-CMV-DIO-hrGFP (titer: 6.0 × 10 12 copies/ml) was injected bilaterally into the VTA (AP: from -3.0 to -3.3 mm, LM: ±0.5 mm, depth: 4.2 mm) of DAT-IRES-Cre mice under ~1.2% isoflurane anesthesia. Injection volume was 200 nl per site. The mice were kept in their home cages for at least 3 weeks after AAV injection, prior to behavioral or electrophysiological experiments. The biocompatibility of the scintillator crystal was assessed by implanting a rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystal (0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 1.0−1.5 mm) over the VTA using a metal guide tube (inner diameter: 0.5 mm) with a movable metal plunger. After crystal implantation, the metal guide tube was first withdrawn and then the plunger was retracted. An optical fiber (0.4 mm diameter) attached to a stainless steel ferrule (CFM14L10, Thorlabs) was implanted over the VTA using a cannula holder (XCF, Thorlabs). The optical fiber cannula was permanently cemented to the skull.Slice preparation Mice were perfused under isoflurane anesthesia with icecold dissection buffer containing (in mM): 87 NaCl, 25 NaHCO 3 , 25 D-glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 CaCl 2 , 7 MgCl 2 , and 75 sucrose, aerated with 95% O 2 + 5% CO 2 . The mice were then decapitated, and the brain was isolated and cut into 200-μm-thick horizontal sections on a vibratome in the ice-cold dissection buffer. The slices containing the VTA were incubated for 30 min at 35°C in the dissection buffer and maintained thereafter at RT in standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO 3 , 25 D-glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 1 MgCl 2 , and 2 CaCl 2 ), aerated with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 .In vitro electrophysiology Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from cultured HEK 293 cells or VTA-DA neurons in acute brain slices were performed using an IPA amplifier (Sutter Instruments) at RT. Fluorescently labelled cells were visually identified using an upright microscope (BX51WI; Olympus) equipped with a scientific complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (sCMOS) video camera (Zyla4.2plus; Andor). The recording pipettes (5−7 MΩ) were filled with the intracellular solution containing (in mM): 135 potassium gluconate, 4 KCl, 4 Mg-ATP, 10 Na 2phosphocreatine, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3, 280 mOsmol/l). Patch pipettes (5-7 MΩ) had a series resistance of 6.5-25 MΩ, which was compensated to have a final value of 6.5-7.0 MΩ for voltage-clamp recordings (29). For measuring photocurrents of depolarizing opsins, HEK 293 cells or DA neurons were voltage-clamped at −60 mV. For measuring the photocurrents of GtACR1 and GtACR2, cells were voltage-clamped at 0 mV (HEK 293 cells) or −30 mV (DA neurons). For measuring the photocurrents of ArchT or eNpHR3.0, cells were voltage-clamped at −20-0 mV to achieve near zero holding currents. For currentclamp recordings from DA neurons, the membrane potentials were held at around −60 mV to prevent spontaneous firings. The PL intensity of the specimen was measured using a photodiode sensor that was routinely calibrated for each experiment.Conditioned place preference test More than 2 weeks after AAV injection, mice were bilaterally implanted with the rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystals (0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 1.0−1.5 mm) and used for behavioral tests at >1 week after crystal implantation. Conditioned place preference (CPP) tests were performed in an X-ray machine (MX-160Labo, mediXtec Japan) at the dark period. On the first day of the tests, mice were placed in a test chamber with two compartments (each 10 cm × 12 cm) with different floor textures and visual cues on the walls (Fig. 4B) . The mice were habituated to the chamber for 5 min and then allowed to explore freely for 10 min without X-ray irradiation. On the second and third days, the mice were conditioned for 10 min in the chamber in the chamber in which only one of the compartments received X-ray irradiation (150 kV, 3 mA; fig. S8 ). To restrict the X-ray irradiation to one side, the other compartment was partially shielded with lead boards (Fig.  4B ). On the fourth day, the mice were placed in the chamber for 10 min without X-ray irradiation. In the unbiased CPP tests, the mice were videotaped at an oblique angle using a USB camera while the whole chamber was illuminated by ambient white LED light, and the ears of mice were tracked offline using DeepLabCut (30). For the biased CPP tests (fig. S9 ), a soft floor mat was placed in the non-X-irradiated compartment so that the mice could spend less time in the X-irradiated compartment. In the biased CPP tests, the mice were filmed under infrared (IR) light using an IR camera, and the total time spent in each compartment was measured based on the location of the mouse head. After completion of the CPP tests, the mice were perfused with 4% PFA and the brain was postfixed overnight. The brain was cut into coronal sections (section thickness: 80 µm) and the Ce:GAGG implantation sites were observed. The trace of the implanted crystal was observed at 0−200 µm from the closest edge of labelled VTA. One mouse that showed considerable damage to the VTA caused by a ventrally-implanted crystal was excluded from the analysis.

Immunostaining

For immunostaining of cultured neurons, fixed neurons were washed three times with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.25% Triton-X in PBS (blocking buffer), and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-GFP, mouse monoclonal, 1:1000, Wako; anti-c-Fos, rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer for 24−48 h at 4°C. The fixed neurons were washed three times with blocking buffer and then incubated with secondary antibodies (CF594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 1:1000, Biotium; CF488A donkey anti-mouse IgG, 1:1000, Biotium) overnight at 4°C.For immunostaining of brain slices, we performed transcardial perfusion and post-fixation for overnight using 4% PFA. The fixed brains were sectioned into coronal or horizontal slices on a vibratome (section thickness: 80 µm). The slices were washed three times with blocking buffer, and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-tyrosine hydroxylase, rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000, Merck Millipore; anti-Iba1, rabbit monoclonal, 1:1000, Wako; anti-GFAP, mouse monoclonal, 1:1000, Merck Millipore; anti-GFP, mouse monoclonal, 1:1000, Wako; anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175), rabbit polyclonal, 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology) in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The slices were then washed three times with blocking buffer and then incubated with secondary antibodies (CF594-or CF488A-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 1:1000, Biotium; CF488A-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, 1:1000, Biotium) in blocking buffer for 1-2 h at RT. Cellular nuclei were stained by incubation for 10-15 min with DAPI (2 µM in phosphate buffer) at RT. The stained samples were mounted using DABCO, and observed under a florescence microscope (BZ-9000, Keyence) or confocal microscope (LSM710, Zeiss). The green signal of bReaChES-eYFP ( Fig. 4A and fig. S4a ) was further enhanced by immunostaining using anti-GFP antibody.

Data analysis

The number of HEK 293 cells in 35-mm culture dishes ( fig.  S6 ) was counted by randomly selecting 100 µm × 100 µm squares surrounding the Ce:GAGG crystal for the dishes containing the crystal or anywhere on the coverslip for control dishes. The mean cell density was calculated as the average of the cell densities of three sites per dish.To estimate the survival rate of dissociated hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3E) , we randomly selected three 0.2 mm × 1.0 mm rectangles per dish, surrounding the Ce:GAGG crystal (one of the longer sides of the rectangle was attached to the edge of the crystal) for the dishes containing the crystal or anywhere on the coverslip for control dishes. The dissociated neurons within these sites at DIV1 were monitored at DIV2, 4, and 7.To quantify the pixel intensity in epifluorescence images ( fig. S7) , a 0.1 mm × 0.3 mm rectangle was drawn around the trace of the Ce:GAGG crystal or the optical fibre (one of the shorter sides of the rectangle was attached to the edge of the trace; three sites per image). The rectangle was divided into three sections measuring 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm, and the mean pixel intensity of each square was calculated. The mean global intensity for one image was calculated as the average pixel intensity of the nine squares.To analyze animal movements in the CPP tests using DeepLabCut (30), the left and right ears of mice were manually annotated using 20−80 frames per movie to train a deep neural network. An estimated ear position with low likelihood (<0.8) was omitted and replaced with a pixel value obtained using linear interpolation of neighboring .

The middle pixel coordinate between the tracked left and right ears was considered the animal trajectory, assuming that the coordinate represented the location of the mouse head. The heat maps shown in Fig. 4D indicate the probability of the presence of the animal trajectory within each 100 × 100 pixel image. The number of rearing events was calculated by counting the number of times that the height of the mouse head exceeded a threshold level.

"Abstract

Strict interventions were successful to control the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China. As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. These findings can help guide global intervention policies.

also estimate age differences in susceptibility to infection and clinical disease based on contact tracing information gathered by the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), China. Based on those findings, we develop a mathematical transmission model to disentangle how transmission is affected by age differences in the biology of COVID-19 infection and disease, and altered mixing patterns due to social distancing. In turn, we project the impact of social distancing and school closure on COVID-19 transmission.To estimate changes in age-mixing patterns associated with COVID-19 interventions, we performed contact surveys in two cities, Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and Shanghai, one of the largest and most densely populated cities in southeast China. Shanghai experienced extensive importation of COVID-19 cases from Wuhan as well as local transmission (3) . The surveys were conducted from February 1, 2020 to February 10, 2020, as transmission of COVID-19 peaked across China and stringent interventions were in place. Participants in Wuhan were asked to complete a questionnaire describing their contact behavior (4, 5) on two different days: i) a regular weekday between December 24, 2020 and December 30, 2020, before the COVID-19 outbreak was officially recognized by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (used as baseline); and ii) the day before the interview (outbreak period). A similar survey was conducted in Shanghai to obtain information on contacts during the COVID-19 outbreak period; contacts for the baseline period were based on a survey using the same design conducted in the same city in 2017-2018 (6) . Details are given in the Supplementary Material.We analyzed a total of 1,245 contacts reported by 636 study participants in Wuhan, and 1,296 contacts reported by 557 participants in Shanghai. In Wuhan, the average daily number of contacts per participant was significantly reduced from 14.6 for a regular weekday (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 14.0) to 2.0 for the outbreak period (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 1.9) (p<0.001). The reduction in contacts was significant for all stratifications by sex, age group, type of profession, and household size, except for pre-school children aged 0-6 years old (Tab. 1). A larger reduction was observed in Shanghai, where the average daily number of contacts declined from 20.6 (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 21.7) to 2.3 (weighted mean contacts by age structure: 2.1). Although an average individual in Shanghai reported more contacts than one in Wuhan on a regular weekday, this difference disappeared during the COVID-19 outbreak period.The typical features of age-mixing patterns(5, 6) emerge in Wuhan and Shanghai when we consider the regular baseline weekday period ( Fig. 1A and 1D ). These features can be illustrated in the form of age-stratified contact matrices (provided as ready-to-use tables in the Supplementary Materials), where each cell represents the average number of contacts that an individual has with other individuals, stratified by age groups. The bottom left corner of the matrix, corresponding to contacts between school age children, is where the largest number of contacts is recorded. The contribution of contacts in the workplace is visible in the central part of the matrix, while the three diagonals (from bottom left to top right) represent contacts between household members. In contrast, for the outbreak period where strict social distancing was in place, much of the above-mentioned features disappears, essentially leaving the sole contribution of household mixing ( Fig. 1B and 1E ). In particular, contacts between school-age individuals are fully removed, as highlighted by differencing baseline and outbreak matrices ( Fig. 1C and  1F ). Overall, contacts during the outbreak mostly occurred at home with household members (94.1% in Wuhan and 78.5% in Shanghai), thus the outbreak contact matrix nearly coincides with the within-household contact matrix in both study sites and the assortativity by age feature observed for regular days almost entirely disappear (see Supplementary Materials).To understand the interplay between social distancing interventions, changes in human mixing patterns, and outbreak dynamics, we also need to consider potential age differences in susceptibility to infection. This is currently a topic of debate, as little information on the age profile of asymptomatic cases is available (7, 8) . To this aim, we analyzed contact tracing information from detailed epidemiological field investigations conducted by the Hunan CDC (Supplement). We calculated the age-specific relative risk of infection for close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 index cases. Briefly, all close contacts of COVID-19 cases reported in Hunan province were placed under medical observation for 14 days and were tested using real-time RT-PCR. Those who developed symptoms and tested positive were considered as symptomatic confirmed cases, while contacts who tested positive without exhibiting symptoms were considered as asymptomatic infections. The total of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was used to estimate the relative susceptibility to infection by age. The ratio of symptomatic cases to total infections was used to estimate the relative probability of developing symptoms (see Supplementary Material). We found age differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection, where young individuals (aged 0-14 years) had a lower risk of infection than individual ages 65 years and over (OR=0.41 (95%CI: 0.18-0.93), p-value=0.026). There was a weak non-significant trend towards lower susceptibility in middle-aged adults, relative to seniors (OR=0.76, 95%CI: 0.46-1.24, Tab. 2). These findings are in contrast with a previous study in Shenzhen, where susceptibility to infection did not change with age (7). Moreover, we found that the relative probability of developing symptoms also increased with age, however the difference was not statistically significant (Tab. 2).Based on the estimated age-specific mixing patterns and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, we developed a SIR model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and tested the impact of social distancing measures on disease dynamics. In the model, the population is divided into three epidemiological categories: susceptible, infectious, and removed (either recovered or deceased individuals), stratified by 14 age groups. Susceptible individuals can become infectious after contact with an infectious individual according to the estimated age-specific susceptibility to infection. Because we did not see age differences in the probability of developing symptoms upon infection, we assumed equal infectivity across all age groups. The rate at which contacts occur is determined by the estimated mixing patterns in each age group.A key parameter regulating the dynamics of the model is the basic reproduction number (R0), which corresponds to the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case in a fully susceptible population. The mean time interval between two consecutive generations of cases was taken to be 5.1 days (2) . Details are reported in the Supplementary Materials.For baseline R0 values in the range 2.0-3.5 associated with a regular weekday contact patterns (corresponding to the early phase of COVID-19 spread in Wuhan (9-15)), we find that the profound alteration of mixing patterns of the magnitude observed in Wuhan and Shanghai leads to a drastic decrease in R0. When we consider contact matrices representing the outbreak period, keeping the same baseline disease transmissibility as the pre-intervention period, the reproductive number drops well below the epidemic threshold both in Wuhan and Shanghai ( Fig. 2A) . In an uncontrolled epidemic (without intervention measure, travel restriction, or spontaneous behavioral response of the population), we estimate the mean infection attack rate to be in the range 64%-92% after a year of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, with slight variation between Wuhan and Shanghai (variations of about 5%-12%, Fig. 2B ).On the other hand, if we consider a scenario where social distancing measures are implemented early on, as the new virus emerges, the estimated R0 remains under the threshold and thus the epidemic cannot take off in either location. Furthermore, we estimate that the magnitude of interventions implemented in Wuhan and Shanghai would have been enough to bring the reproduction number below 1.0 for baseline R0 up to ~7 in Wuhan and ~11.5 in Shanghai (Fig. 2A) . We also conduct sensitivity analyses on assumptions about the susceptibility profile of infections, since there is still uncertainty about this parameter (see Supplementary Material). Our conclusions are robust to assuming equal susceptibility in all age groups.Finally, armed with a carefully calibrated model, we turn to assess the impact of a preemptive mass school closure. We used the same estimates of relative susceptibility to infection by age as in our main analysis (see Supplementary Material for a sensitivity analysis assuming equal susceptibility to infection). We considered two different contact pattern scenarios, based on data from Shanghai: contacts estimated during vacations period (6) and contacts estimated during regular weekdays, after all contacts occurring in school settings have been removed (6) . Either one of these scenarios represent a simplification of a school closure strategy as during vacations children can still attend additional education, while removing all contacts in the school setting does not take into account that, for instance, parents may need to leave work to take care of children. We estimated that limiting contact patterns to those observed during vacations would interrupt transmission for baseline R0 up to 1.5 (Fig. 2C) . Removing all school contacts would do the same for baseline R0 up to 1.2. If we apply these interventions to a COVID-19 scenario, assuming a baseline R0 of 2 -3.5, we can achieve a noticeable decrease in infection attack rate and peak incidence, and a delay in the epidemic, but transmission is not interrupted (Fig. 2D ). For instance, for baseline R0=2.5 and assuming a vacation mixing pattern, the peak daily incidence is reduced by about 57%. In the corresponding scenario where school contacts are removed, we estimate a reduction of about 20%. Overall, school-based policies are not sufficient to entirely prevent a COVID-19 outbreak but they can have a significant impact on disease dynamics, and hence on hospital surge capacity.This study suffers from several limitations. First, the estimated mixing patterns for a regular weekday in Wuhan may be affected by recall bias since contacts were assessed retrospectively. For Shanghai, we relied on a survey conducted in December 2017 -May 2018, using the same design as the one conducted during the outbreak period, thus avoiding recall bias. It is also important to note that changes in contact patterns were measured in a context where social distancing was applied together with rapid isolation of infected individuals (including suspected cases) and quarantine of close contacts for 14 days. Only a small portion of the population in the two study sites was affected by contact tracing and quarantine, thus having little to no effect on the average contact patterns of the general population. However, in reconstructing the observed epidemics in Wuhan and Shanghai, it is not possible to separate the effects of case-based strategies from population wide social distancing. In our simulation model, we estimated the effect of social distancing alone; combining social distancing and case-based interventions would have a synergistic effect to further reduce transmission. Further, our estimates of age differences in susceptibility to infection and probability of developing symptoms are based on active testing of contacts of 57 primary confirmed cases. These data suffer from the usual difficulties inherent to identifying epidemiological links and index cases. Seroepidemiology studies are currently lacking but will be essential to fully resolve the population susceptibility profile of COVID-19.While the age patterns of contacts were not significantly different between the two study locations during the COVID-19 outbreak period, these patterns may not be fully representative of other locations in China and abroad, where social distancing measures may differ. Modeling results may possibly be underestimating the effect of social distancing interventions as our results account for a decreased number of contacts but ignore the impact of increased awareness of the population, which may have also affected the type of social interactions (e.g., increased distance between individuals while in contact, or use of face mask (16, 17) ). Finally, our school closure simulations are not meant to formulate a full intervention strategy, which would require identification of epidemic triggers to initiate closures and evaluation of different durations of intervention (5) . Nonetheless, our modeling exercise provides an indication of the possible impact of a nation-wide preemptive strategy on the infection attack rate and peak incidence. To generalize these findings to other contexts, location-specific age-mixing patterns and population structures should be considered.Our study provides evidence that the interventions put in place in Wuhan and Shanghai, and the resulting changes in human behavior, drastically decreased daily contacts, essentially reducing them to household interactions. Assuming the same scale of contact-distancing measures were to be put in place in other locations, human mixing patterns could be captured by data on within-household contacts, which are available for several countries around the world (4) (5) (6) (18) (19) (20) . Further research should concentrate on refining age-specific estimates of susceptibility to infection, disease, and infectivity, which are instrumental to evaluating the impact of school-and work-based control strategies currently under consideration worldwide (21, 22) .

"Abstract

1Background: With new cases of COVID-19 surging around the world, many countries have to prepare for mov-2 ing beyond the containment phase. Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, 3 delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the ongoing seasonal influenza 4 activity.Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures 6 (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to the spread of COVID-19 awareness and of short-7 term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the 8 peak number of diagnoses. 9Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack 10 rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy 11 of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number 12 of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term 13 government interventions can only delay the peak (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention).14 Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination 15 about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of 16 rapidly spreading awareness on the use of these self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-17 initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for 18 an increasing COVID-19 burden.Evidence to date suggests that containment of SARS-CoV-2 using quarantine, travel restrictions, isolation of symp-26 tomatic cases, and contact tracing may need to be supplemented by other interventions. Given its rapid spread 27 across the world and immense implications for public health, it is urgent to understand whether non-case-based 28 interventions can mitigate, delay or even prevent a COVID-19 epidemic. One such strategy is a broader-scale 29 contact rate reduction enforced by governments which was used during previous outbreaks, e.g., the 1918 influenza 30 pandemic and the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Mexico. Alternatively, governments and media may stimu-31 late self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) by generating awareness 32 about COVID-19, especially when economic and societal consequences are taken into account. Both of these strate-33 gies may have a significant impact on the outbreak dynamics. Currently, there are no comparative studies that 34 investigate their viability for controlling a COVID-19 epidemic.Added value of this study 36 Using a transmission model parameterized with current best estimates of epidemiological parameters, we evaluated 37 the impact of handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing due to COVID-19 awareness and of government-38 imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses. 39 We show that a short-term (1-3 months) government intervention initiated early into the outbreak can only delay 40 the peak number of diagnoses but neither alters its magnitude nor the attack rate. Our analyses also highlight the 41 importance of spreading awareness about COVID-19 in the population, as the impact of self-imposed measures is 42 strongly dependent on it. When awareness spreads fast, simple self-imposed measures such as handwashing are more 43 effective than short-term government intervention. Self-imposed measures do not only diminish and postpone the 44 peak number of diagnoses, but they can prevent a large epidemic altogether when their efficacy is sufficiently high 45 (above 50%). Qualitatively, these results will aid public health professionals to compare and select interventions 46 for designing effective outbreak control policies.Implications of all available evidence 48 Our results highlight that dissemination of evidence-based information about effective prevention measures (hand-49 washing, mask-wearing, and self-imposed social distancing) can be a key strategy for mitigating and postponing a 50 COVID-19 epidemic. Government interventions (e.g., closing schools and prohibiting mass gatherings) implemented 51 early into the epidemic and lasting for a short-time can only buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an 52

Introduction self-imposed prevention measures on reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are currently missing but are of 88 crucial importance in the attempt to stop its spread. Moreover, if a COVID-19 epidemic cannot be prevented, it 89 is important to know how to effectively diminish and postpone the epidemic peak to give healthcare professionals 90 more time to prepare and react effectively to an increasing health care burden. For affected areas like Europe, 91 where the outbreak runs concurrently with the influenza season, the importance to identify such interventions is 92 profound.

94

Using a transmission model we evaluated the impact of self-imposed measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and 95 social distancing) due to awareness about COVID-19 and of a short-term government-imposed social distancing 96 intervention on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses since the 97 first case. We provide a comparative analysis of these interventions and assess the range of intervention efficacies 98 for which a large COVID-19 outbreak can be prevented. However, severely symptomatic patients in isolation may be removed from the population due to disease-associated 116 mortality. Individuals with severe symptoms (I S ) are diagnosed and kept in isolation (I D ) at rate ν until they recover (R S ) at rate γ S or die at rate η. In the extended model with disease awareness, the population is stratified not only by the disease status but also by mask-wearing and self-imposed social distancing that can lower their susceptibility, infectivity and/or contact rate.

127

Individuals who know their disease status (I D and R S ) do not adapt any such measures since they know that they 128 cannot contract the disease again. Hence, they are excluded from the awareness transition process and we assume 129 that their behaviour in the contact process is identical to disease-unaware individuals. B). We assume that awareness fades and individuals return to the unaware state at a constant rate. The latter 134 means that they no longer use self-imposed measures. For simplicity, we assume that awareness acquisition and 135 fading rates are the same for individuals of type S, E, I M , and R M . However, the rate of awareness acquisition 136 6 .

Infectious individuals with severe symptoms who are disease-aware (I a S ) get diagnosed and are kept in isolation (I a D ) at rate ν a , recover at rate γ a S and die from disease at rate η a . (B) shows awareness dynamics. Infectious individuals with severe symptoms (I S ) acquire disease awareness (I a S ) at rate λ aware proportional to the rate of awareness spread and to the current number of diagnosed individuals (I D and I a D ) in the population. As awareness fades, these individuals return to the unaware state at rate µ S . The acquisition rate of awareness (kλ aware ) and the rate of awareness fading (µ) are the same for individuals of type S, E, I M , and R M , where k is the reduction in susceptibility to the awareness acquisition compared to I S individuals. Table 1 provides the description and values of all parameters. 140 We considered short-term government intervention aimed at fostering social distancing in the population and a 141 suite of measures self-imposed by disease-aware individuals, i.e., mask-wearing, hand washing, and self-imposed 142 social distancing.

The efficacy of handwashing is described by the reduction in susceptibility 152 (i.e., probability of transmission per single contact) of susceptible disease-aware individuals (S a ) which ranges from 153 0% (zero efficacy) to 100% (full efficacy).

154

Self-imposed social distancing 155 Disease-aware individuals may also practice social distancing, i.e., maintaining distance to others and avoid congre-156 gate settings. As a consequence, this measure leads to a change in mixing patterns in the population. The efficacy of social distancing of disease-aware individuals is described by the reduction in their contact rate which is varied 158 from 0% (no social distancing or zero efficacy) to 100% (full self-isolation or full efficacy).

159

Short-term government-imposed social distancing 160 Governments may decide to promote social distancing policies through interventions such as school and workplace 161 closures or by issuing a ban on large gatherings. These policies will cause a community-wide contact rate reduction, 162 regardless of the awareness status. Here, we assume that the government intervention is initiated if the number of 163 diagnosed individuals exceeds a certain threshold (10-1000 persons) and terminates after a fixed period of time (1-3 164 months). As such, the intervention is implemented early into the epidemic. The efficacy of government-imposed 165 social distancing is described by the reduction of the average contact rate in the population which ranges from 0% 166 (no distancing) to 100% (complete quarantine of the population). and of all individuals (government-imposed social distancing). We refer to these quantities as the efficacy of a 175 prevention measure and vary it from 0% (zero efficacy) to 100% (full efficacy) ( Table 1 ). The main analyses were 176 performed for two values of the rate of awareness spread that corresponded to scenarios of slow and fast spread 177 of awareness in the population (Table 1) . For these scenarios, the proportion of the aware population at the peak 178 of the epidemic was 40% and 90%, respectively. In the main analyses, government-imposed social distancing was 179 initiated when 10 individuals got diagnosed and was lifted after 3 months.

Figure 4 shows the impact of all considered self-imposed measures as well as of the government-imposed social 217 distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and the time to the peak for slow rate of awareness spread. 218In this scenario, the model predicts progressively larger reductions in the peak number of diagnoses and in the 219 attack rate as the efficacy of the self-imposed measures increases. In the limit of 100% efficacy, the reduction in the 220 peak number of diagnoses is 23% to 30% (Figure 4 A) and the attack rate decreases from 16% to 12-13% ( Figure 221 11 .

The efficacy of prevention measures was varied between 0% and 100%. In the context of this study, the efficacy of social distancing denotes the reduction in the contact rate. The efficacy of handwashing and mask-wearing are given by the reduction in susceptibility and infectivity, respectively. The simulations were started with one case.

Since the proportion of aware individuals who change 223 their behavior is too small to make a significant impact on transmission, self-imposed measures can only mitigate 224 but not prevent an epidemic. When awareness spreads at a slow rate, a 3-month government intervention has a 225 contrasting impact. The time to the peak number of diagnoses is longer for more stringent contact rate reductions. 226For example, at 100% efficacy (full quarantine) the government can postpone the peak by almost 7 months but 227 its magnitude and attack rate are unaffected.

For many countries around the world, the focus of public health officers in the context of COVID-19 epidemic has 256 shifted from containment to mitigation and delay. Our study provides new insights for designing effective outbreak 257 control strategies. We show that hand-washing, mask-wearing, and social distancing adopted by disease-aware 258 individuals are all viable strategies for delaying the epidemic peak, flattening the epidemic curve and reducing the 259 attack rate. We show that the rate at which disease awareness spreads has a strong impact on how self-imposed CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034827 doi: medRxiv preprint measures, a large epidemic can be prevented when the efficacy exceeds 50%. Moreover, the effect of combinations 264 of self-imposed measures is additive. In practical terms, it means that SARS-CoV-2 will not cause a large outbreak 265 in a country where 90% of the population adopt handwashing and social distancing that are 25% efficacious (i.e., 266 reduce susceptibility and contact rate by 25%, respectively).

268

Although the effects of self-imposed measures on mitigating and delaying the epidemic are similar (see Figure 4 269 and Figure 5) , not all explored efficacy values may be achieved for each measure. For instance, handwashing with 270 soap or using alcohol-based sanitizers may remove the virus completely leading to 100% efficacy. 19 For surgical 271 masks, their filtration efficiency has a wide range (0%-84%) and thus their actual efficacy is difficult to quantify. 21

272

For this reason, the promotion of handwashing might become preferable. Thus, for a fair comparison between 273 measures, realistic efficacy values of a specific measure should be taken into consideration.

275

We contrasted self-imposed measures stimulated by disease awareness with mandated social distancing. Our anal-276 yses show that short-term government-imposed social distancing that is implemented early into the epidemic, can 277 delay the epidemic peak but does not affect its magnitude nor the attack rate. For example, a 3-month government 278 intervention imposing community-wide contact rate reduction that starts after tens to hundreds diagnoses in the 279 country can postpone the peak by about 7 months. If this intervention is combined with a self-imposed measure, 280 then the delay can be even longer (up to 10 months for handwashing with 30% efficacy). Such an intervention is 281 highly desirable, when a vaccine is being developed or when healthcare systems require more time to treat cases or 282 increase capacity.

283

Since for many countries the COVID-19 epidemic is still in its early stages, government-imposed social distancing 285 was modeled as a short-term intervention initiated when the number of diagnosed individuals was relatively low. 286Our sensitivity analyses showed that government intervention introduced later into the epidemic and imposed for 287 the authors also showed that the optimal strategy is highly dependent on the desired outcome. A detailed analysis 292 of government interventions with different timings and durations that also takes into account the economic and 293 societal consequences, and the cost of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is a subject for future work.

Our study provides the first comparative analysis of a suite of self-imposed measures and of short-term government-296 imposed social distancing as strategies for mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic. In our analyses, we 297 15 . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Our model has several limitations. It does not account for stochasticity, demographics, heterogeneities in contact 305 patterns, spatial effects, inhomogeneous mixing and imperfect isolation. Our conclusions can, therefore, be 306 drawn on a qualitative level. Detailed models will have to be developed to design and tailor effective strategies 307 in particular settings. To take into account the uncertainty in SARS-CoV-19 epidemiological parameters, we 308 performed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the model predictions. As more data become available, 309 our model can be easily updated. In addition, our study assumes that individuals become disease-aware with a 310 rate of awareness acquisition proportional to the number of currently diagnosed individuals. Other forms for the 311 awareness acquisition rate that incorporate, e.g., the saturation of awareness, may be more realistic and would be 312 interesting to explore in future studies.

"Abstract

The focused drug repurposing of known approved drugs (such as lopinavir/ritonavir) has been reported failed for curing SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. It is urgent to generate new chemical entities against this virus. As a key enzyme in the life-cycle of coronavirus, the 3C-like main protease (3CL pro or M pro ) is the most attractive for antiviral drug design. Based on a recently solved structure (PDB ID: 6LU7), we developed a novel advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential lead compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . We obtained a series of derivatives from those lead compounds by our structure-based optimization policy (SBOP). All the 47 lead compounds directly from our AI-model and related derivatives based on SBOP are accessible in our molecular library at https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov. These compounds can be used as potential candidates for researchers in their development of drugs against SARS-CoV-2.author/funder. All rights reserved.

To face the considerable threat of SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent to develop new inhibitors or drugs against this deadly virus. Unfortunately, since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) eighteen years ago, there has been no approved treatment against the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 3 which is similar to SARS-CoV-2. Repurposing potential drugs such as lopinavir and ritonavir also failed to SARS-CoV-2 injected patients. 4 Structure-based antiviral drug design with a new artificial intelligence algorithm may represent a more helpful approach to get the SARS-CoV-2 targeted inhibitors or drugs. Thanks to the prompt efforts of many researchers, we have several pieces of important information about this vital virus genome and protein structures. We now know that the non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 and it is a cysteine protease, which also been called ""3C-like protease"" (3CL pro ). Moreover, we know that the 3D structure of 3CL pro is very similar to SARS-CoV with a sequence identity of >96% and 3D structure superposition RMSDCα of 0.44 Å as shown in Figures S1 and S2. 3CL pro has been reported as an attractive target for developing anti-coronaviral drugs: 1) this protease is highly conserved in both sequences and 3D structures; 5 2) 3CL pro is a key enzyme for related virus (including SARS and SARS-CoV-2) replication; 3) it only exists in the virus, not in humans. Developing specific antiviral drugs targeting 3CL pro of the specific virus has shown significant success; for example, both approved drugs lopinavir and ritonavir can completely occupy the substrate-binding site of 3CL pro to break down the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, due to the large difference between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro , lopinavir and ritonavir were validated ineffective for inhibiting SARS-Cov-2. 4 On the other hand, the substrate-binding site of 3CL pro is almost the same between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS as Figure S3 presents. The developed potential inhibitors and drug-design experience targeting SARS-3CL pro may also be applicable to SARS-CoV-2. For author/funder. All rights reserved.

","Introduction

The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused an outbreak of coronavirus example, the recently solved structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (PDB ID: 6LU7)indicates that the developed inhibitor N3, 6 which is a covalent inhibitor derived from non-covalent inhibitors against SARS can also bind SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro with a similar binding conformation ( Figure S4 ).All the above available information paved a way to design new targeted covalent inhibitors (TCI) 7 against SARS-CoV-2. A successful TCI against 3CL pro must first be able to fit in the binding site of 3CL pro with an appropriate pose that keeps its reactive groups close enough to the Cys145, which then undergoes a chemical step (nucleophilic attack by Cys145) leading to the formation of a stable covalent bond as presented in the scheme below:TCIs usually have a longer target residence time than the relative non-covalent inhibitors in theory given the following: 1) For the inhibition, k1 must be larger than k2, and thus the non-covalent binding is determined by the equilibrium constant k1/k2; 2)TCIs have the chemical reaction step with the target, where usually k3 >> k4; and 3) for TCIs, the binding process is controlled by k1 k3/(k2 k4), which is bigger than k1/k2 in non-covalent inhibitors. In some extreme cases k4 = 0, and hence, these irreversible inhibitors covalently bind the target until the target disappears. 7, 8 Considering the inhibitors of SARS 3CL pro may be also bio-active to SARS-CoV-2, we have created a molecular library including all the reported SARS-3CL pro inhibitors (284 molecules) 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and we will also add new validated molecular structures into this library with our research progresses. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or drugs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2.Thus, with the hope to discover novel candidate drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, we combine artificial intelligence (AI) with the structure-based drug design (SBDD) to accelerate generating potential lead compounds and design TCIs. AI, especially deep learning, has been applied in predicting molecular properties 30, 31, 32, 33 and designing novel molecules 34 . Unlike earlier deep-learning molecular design by adding single atom one at a time 34, 35 , our approach explores new molecules by adding a meaningful molecular fragment one by one, which is not only computationally more efficient but also chemically more reasonable. To make our AI model work well, the first step is to prepare the molecular fragment library as shown in Figure 1 . We used our collected SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors (284 molecules) as the initial molecule database targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . Then, we split this set of molecules into fragments with a molecule weight no more than 200 daltons. Both of the collected inhibitors and the fragments are supplied in https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov.Then we applied an advanced deep Q-learning network with the fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential lead compounds. Noted, if researchers have enough experience and internal lead compounds or biased fragments, they can inject all such information into ADQN-FBDD by manually adding the lead compounds and biased fragments to the corresponding files. By using the same fragments directly from existing bioactivate molecules, our ADQN-FBDD agent can easily access the potential chemical space focused on 3CL pro of SARS-CoV-2.author/funder.

In total, 47 of these compounds were selected with high scores from our AImodel's reward function. Then these molecules were further evaluated by docking and covalent docking studies. The lead compound #46 with a high covalent docking score attracts our attention, which also has a low difference between non-covalent and covalent docking pose among the 47 lead compounds. After carefully checking the lead #46's interaction mode with 3CL pro , we believe there is still much space to optimize lead it. Then we designed a series of derivatives from compound #46 based on our chemical biology knowledge and the structure-based optimization policy. All the generated molecular structures are published in our code library https://github.com/tbwxmu/2019-nCov. We encourage researchers who are interested in finding a potential treatment for this viral infection to synthesize and evaluate some of these molecules for treating COVID-19.

These 47 virtual leads display suitable 3Dcomplexity with common characteristics of peptidomimetics and protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors. They are mainly ranked by covalent-docking scores, considering covalent-docking also contains the scores of non-covalent docking. 36 And we also paid attention on the RMSD difference between the covalent binding and noncovalent binding poses based on all heavy atoms. Finally, we selected the lead molecule #46 as displayed in Figure 3 with both a good covalent docking score and a small RMSD value (Table S1 ). We further optimized it and get a series of derivatives based on the SBDD approach.

Results

Molecule #46 was ranked number 1 based on the covalent docking score and its interaction model with the binding site was carefully checked as shown in Figure 3 .Although compound #46 has the best covalent docking score, it has the alerting group aldehyde. Considering there is still much space for compound #46 to fill in the S1'subsite and α-ketoamides may be good to fit the oxyanion hole ( Figure 4A ) of 3CL pro , 3 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The triazole ring forms an H-bond with His163; the fragment of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde forms a covalent bond with Cys145, i.e., the key residue in the catalytic center of the protease, resulting in covalent inhibition; aldehyde carbonyl forms an H-bond with His41; and besides, the hydroxyl of chromone at position 7 forms an H-bond with Thr190.The non-bonding interaction between compound 46-14-1 and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro is mainly hydrogen bond. The carbonyl group of covalent scaffold α-ketoamide forms Hbonds with Leu141 and Gly143 as a hydrogen acceptor or a hydrogen donor. The hydrogen on the nitrogen atom of the triazole ring forms an H-bond with Glu166, while Glu166 also forms an H-bond with the carbonyl group on the main chain. The oxygen in the β-lactam ring forms an H-bond with His41. In order to enhance the polarity of the compounds, sulfonic groups were introduced to replace the ketone carbonyl groups on the main chain and sulfonamides 46-14-2 were obtained. The covalent docking model of compound 46-14-2 with SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro is shown in Figure 4 C and D.In order to make the compound 46-14-2 fit the active pocket with a higher affinity, we added a carbon atom to the sulfonic acid group of the original molecule, extending the carbon chain to increase the flexibility of the molecule, and obtained another optimized compound 46-14-3. The mode of covalent docking with SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro is shown in Figure 5 . Due to the introduction of carbon atoms and the enhancement of molecular flexibility, the β-lactam ring can be inserted deeper into the S2 pocket and the other fragments of the compound can better adapt to the S1, S1' and S3 subsites. The αcarbonyl carbon on the α-ketoamide of compound 46-14-3 forms a covalent bond with the key residue Cys145 on the protease, but the main non-bond interaction is still hydrogen bond (indicated by a yellow dash). The triazole ring mainly forms H-bonds with Phe140 and Glu166 residues in the S1 pocket; α-ketoamide covalent binding fragment mainly forms H-bonds with key amino acid residues Cys145, Gly143 and Ser144 in the S1' subsite, which forms an oxyanion hole in the red circle in Figure 9 ; the β-lactam side chain mainly forms H-bonds with residues Tyr54 and AsS187 in the author/funder.

Our ADQN-FBDD and related pipeline can be used not only for designing anti-COVID-19 drugs but also other structure-based drug discoveries, especially for emerging infetious diseases that require treatments timely.

Markov Decision Process for Molecule Generation

Intuitively, the problem of chemical structure graph generation is formulated as learning a reinforced agent, which performs discrete actions of chemical reaction-based fragment addition or removal in a chemistry-aware Markov Decision Process (MDP). Ac={At} denotes a set of actions that describe the modification made on the current molecule structure at each time step t. Here, each action can be classified into three author/funder.

P =p(st+1 |st … s0) =p(st+1|st, at) is the basic assumption in MDP. The state transition

probability, which specifies the next possible state given the current state and action at time step t. Here, we define the state transition to be deterministic. For example, as Figure 2C indicates S0 to S1, by adding a 1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl fragment on S0, the next state S1 will be the new structure of added 1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl with a probability of 1.R is the reward function that specifies the reward after reaching state ', (0,1] is the discount factor and typically γ = 0.9 in our study. In our framework, the state always has a valid and complete chemical structure at each step as Figure 2C indicates. A reward is given not just at the terminal states, but at each step. Both intermediate rewards and final rewards are used to guide the behavior of the reinforcement learning (RL) agent. So, there is no delayed or sparse reward issue as many other reinforced frameworks suffered. 40, 41 Furthermore, to ensure that the last state is rewarded the most, we use γ T-t to discount the value of the rewards at state ' . In addition, our reward function can directly integrate the experience of medicinal chemists. For example, given a core of interest, medicinal chemists may add biased fragments of their interests and their input can be used to design a reward function that gives high reward signal values to biased fragments so that ADQN-FBDD may have a better chance to generate the desired structures.

Chemical Environment Design

In our RL framework, the chemical environment receives action at from the agent and emits scalar reward rt and state s ' 3 to the agent as Figure 2A shows. Note that the definition of the environment state is different from the general approach that the environment state is only the environment's private representation invisible to the agent.We define the state of the chemical environment s ' 3 as the intermediate generated molecule structure at time step t, which is fully observable by the RL agent.

For the task of molecule generation, the environment incorporates rules of chemistry. In our study, chemistry rules are not only the basic chemical valency, but also the rules about adding and removing the fragments derived from known inhibitors based on chemical reactions.The detail information of 45 defined chemical reaction rules is presented in Table S2 .

Agent Design

As indicated in Figure where < =~8 (? = ) is the expectation within policy π on state st taken at and R( E , E )denotes the reward at step n. Value function Q π (st , at) measures the value of taking action at on state st. V π (st ) is the value of being at state st means how good to be in this state. Obviously, V π (st ) can be seen as a part of Q π (st , at). Then, the rest part from Q π (st , at) can be defined as the so-called advantage function A π (st , at) 42 as:Intuitively, the advantage value shows how advantageous selecting the action is relative to the others at the same given state.

Prioritized Experience Replay

Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) 45 is a technique to enable reinforcement learning agents remember and reuse experience from the past, and to replay important transitions more frequently. PER is very useful for replaying some less frequent experiences. Here, we use the same code of ""Prioritized Replay Buffer"" from open AI's gym with version 0.15.4. 46 Finally, our RL agent is the double dueling deep Q learning with fixed qtargets and prioritized experience replay.

Fragment Library Design

The fragment-based approach to drug discovery (FBDD) has been established as an efficient tool in the search for new drugs. 47 The idea of FBDD is that proper optimization of each unique interaction in the binding site and subsequent incorporation into a single molecular entity should produce a compound with a binding affinity that is the sum of the individual interactions.

Reward Design

Most reported RL methods using the complete structure information of a positive drug or inhibitor as the template, 38, 39 and they design a reward function for the RL agent to learn to regenerate the template structure or generate highly similar structures to the template. This way may be useful in testing the performance of RL methods but not suitable in a real-world drug design because no one knows the complete structural information of the novel molecule. A more practical approach is to learn the structure features of existing drugs or inhibitors to local, focused chemical space for a specific protein target. Instead of simply putting attention on the diversity of molecule structure, we explore the possibility of generating novel molecules based on the existing knowledge. Here, we designed a deep reinforcement learning reward (DRL-reward) function that consists of the final property score, containing specific fragments (CSF) score and pharmacophore score as:where yez represents weight for the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED)property and its default value is 0.1. yez stands for the QED. QED values can range from 0 (all properties are unfavourable) to 1 (all properties are favourable), which are calculated by eight molecular properties. 53 The score function {?€ of containing specific fragments (csf) is:author/funder.

Molecular Generation and Selection

As discussed in the above reward design part, our reward function considers the molecular descriptor thresholds (QED>0.1), the defined pharmacophores and biased fragments. In total, 4,922 unique valid structures were automatically generated and all matched the defined rules by using ADQN-FBDD without any pre-training as many other methods need. 35, 40, 41, 54, 55 Next, All the molecules with high deep reinforcement learning scores (DRL score: R(S)>0.6) were kept (47 molecules). Then, these 47 unique molecules were prepared to generate at least 1 conformation with the local energy minimization using the OPLS-2005 force field by the ""ligand prepare"" module of Schrödinger 2015 software. The 47 unique molecules generated a total of 163 3Dconformations before docking into the substrate-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro .Considering the balance between precision and calculation time, the stand-precision (SP) Glide 56 was firstly used to predict the possible non-covalent binding poses in this binding site and the binding site grid centered on the original ligand N3 57 with 20 Å buffer dimensions. Following this non-covalent docking, we also calculated the covalent docking poses and scores for those 47 molecules. We reordered the docking results mainly based on the covalent docking score and the RMSD value from covalent docking pose to non-covalent (Table S1 ).

CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a ABSTRACT Vaccine efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES), regardless of symptoms, is an important endpoint of vaccine trials for pathogens with a high proportion of asymptomaticinfection, as such infections may contribute to onward transmission and outcomes such as Congenital Zika Syndrome.

We model an individually randomized vaccine trial by generating a network of individuals and simulating an epidemic. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Symptomatic or Infectious and Asymptomatic, Recovered model. We then use seven approaches to estimate VES, and we also estimate vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VEP). A corrected relative risk and an interval censored Cox model accurately estimate VES and only require serologic testing of participants once, while a Cox model using only symptomatic infections returns biased estimates. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10% sample and imputing the remaining infection statuses yields unbiased VES estimates across values of R0 and accurate estimates of VEP for higher values. Identifying resource-preserving methods for accurately estimating VES is important in designing trials for diseases with a high proportion of asymptomatic infection.

","MAIN TEXT

In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified a list of priority pathogens with potential to cause future public health emergencies of international concern (1). The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has dedicated one billion dollars to vaccine development efforts starting with three of these: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, Lassa virus and Nipah virus (2) . These three pathogens, as well as others on the WHO's list, such as Zika virus, have high proportions of asymptomatic or mild infection (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Vaccine efficacy against susceptibility to infection (VES) (8) , regardless of symptom level, is an important endpoint of vaccine trials for these pathogens, as infection may contribute to onward transmission, and outcomes such as Congenital Zika Syndrome, even without primary symptoms (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . However, VES is resource-intensive to estimate as it requires testing all trial participants, either by periodically conducting assays for infection throughout the trial, or by serologic testing at the trial's conclusion if natural and vaccine-derived immune responses can be distinguished. Testing trial participants is also necessary for estimating a vaccine's efficacy against progression (VEP) to symptoms, another critical outcome measurement (8) . As noted in an analysis of dengue vaccine trial results, protection against symptomatic infection may in general differ from protection against infection (and in the case of dengue, VEP may be negative due to antibody dependent enhancement) (15) . It is therefore important to consider estimates of both VES and VEP when analyzing trial results.We aim to identify a methodology to accurately estimate VES and VEP when only a limited amount of information is available, and resources -both time and money -are constrained.

METHODS

We model a vaccine trial by first generating a model of a main population and a network of individuals grouped into communities, the structure of which has been described previously (see Supplementary Table 1 for parameters) (16) . The model is compartmental, using deterministic (differential equation) dynamics for the main population and stochastic dynamics in the communities. We simulate an epidemic in the main population with a seasonal transmission rate that generates an epidemic curve with a shape similar to the epidemic curve of the 2015 Zika outbreak in Brazil (17) . The disease is introduced into communities via infectious contact with the main population, and transmission occurs when infected individuals transmit to their susceptible connections in the communities. All susceptible individuals have a daily probability of infection from each of their infectious neighbors of 1-e -β , where β is the force of infection, as well as a daily external hazard of infection from the main population, which varies with the prevalence in the main population. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious/Symptomatic (or Infectious/Asymptomatic)-Recovered (SEIS(IAS)R) model, with estimated incubation and infectious periods of a Zika-like disease (Supplementary Table 1 ).Vector transmission is not directly modeled, so the serial interval of the simulated disease is shorter than that of Zika virus disease. Symptomatic and asymptomatic infections are assumed to be equally infectious, and whether an individual is infected by a symptomatic or an asymptomatic individual does not affect their probability of becoming symptomatic. The baseline parameters of the model assume 20% of those infected in both the vaccine and control .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/295337 doi: bioRxiv preprint groups become symptomatic, based on the estimated proportion of Zika infections that are symptomatic (9) . The epidemic and the vaccine trial are simulated in both a network of individuals grouped into five relatively disconnected communities as well as in a network of individuals in one large community.7.5% of the individuals in the communities are enrolled into a 150-day long trial, and individuals are randomized to the vaccine or control groups. All individuals enrolled into the trial are assumed to be naïve to the infection, which in practice might require serologic testing of all individuals prior to enrollment. The vaccine is leaky, meaning it reduces the probability of infection upon each exposure to an infectious individual. The daily probability of infection from vaccinees' infectious contacts is 1-e -β(1-VE) , where VE is the assumed direct leaky multiplicative vaccine efficacy (8, 18) . VES is estimated with seven different approaches, which are described in Table 1 . Trial status (i.e. vaccine or control) is the explanatory variable for all Cox proportional hazards models, and individuals who are never infected are censored at the end of the trial. Approach 1 assumes that the time of infection is known exactly (to the day) even for asymptomatic infections and therefore would be strictly applicable only where very frequent testing is performed throughout the trial. Approach 2 assumes that infection is unobserved for asymptomatic infections, so only symptomatic infections are included in the Cox regression, and those infected asymptomatically are assumed to have survived without infection to the end of follow up.Because this latter approach leads to bias in estimating VES (see Figure 1 and Results), we consider five additional approaches.In the interval censored Cox models, the exact day of infection for the symptomatic individuals is known (and in practice would be laboratory-confirmed). For the asymptomatically . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/295337 doi: bioRxiv preprint infected individuals, the interval for day of infection ranges from the day of their last negative serologic test to the day of their first positive serologic test. Two different interval lengths are assessed to determine if increased frequency of testing yields more precise results (19) . As mentioned above, this method assumes the ability of the serologic test to distinguish between vaccine acquired immunity and naturally acquired immunity, currently possible for some but not all vaccines/pathogens (20-22).The results from the network with five communities are analyzed first with the same seven approaches, treating the five communities as if they were one large community.Alternatively, to account for the potential for heterogeneity in hazard rates between communities, the Cox models in Approaches 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 are stratified by community (16) , and estimates from Approaches 3 and 4 are calculated separately within each community and meta-analyzed using inverse-variance weighting.Empirical coverage probabilities are calculated by the proportion of simulations with 95% confidence intervals that cover the true VES parameter of the model (60%). Power is estimated by the proportion of simulations in which P < 0.05 for the null hypothesis of VES=0 and the estimated VES is greater than 0. The trial is also simulated with fewer participants to assess power in smaller trials.Additionally, to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing progression to symptoms, VEP is estimated by:The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/295337 doi: bioRxiv preprint Finally, to assess whether the results hold in other contexts, trial parameters such as trial length, VES, and the proportion of the infected individuals in each arm of the trial that becomes symptomatic, are varied.R code for these analyses is available at: https://github.com/rek160/Asymptomatic-Infection-Vaccine-Efficacy. Figure 2 displays the results of the median of 500 simulations in the single-community network, showing VES estimates from the seven approaches described above across three values of R0, the basic reproductive number. As expected, Approach 1 returns accurate VES estimates, while Approach 2 returns estimates biased towards the null because there is differential overestimation of person-time at risk, with worse overestimates in the controls (Figure 1 ). This bias is exacerbated as R0 increases. Approach 3 returns an estimate biased toward the null compared to the true value of VES, also as expected and also worsened at higher levels of R0 (8) .

RESULTS

Approach 4 corrects this bias by converting the risk-based analysis into a rate-based analysis (18, 23 ).The interval censored Cox proportional hazards models (Approaches 5-6) return estimates approximately equal to the VES input into the model. These approaches require fewer resources than would be necessitated by the Cox model with perfect knowledge of infection time (Approach 1) because they use only three or one serologic tests, respectively, rather than frequent monitoring for infection throughout the period of follow-up. Approach 6, the interval censored Cox model with testing only at the end of the trial, yields the same results as Approach 5, testing three times, without substantial difference in coverage probability or power in the .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/295337 doi: bioRxiv preprint settings considered (Table 2 and Figure 3 ). Thus, both Approaches 4 and 6 yield accurate estimates with testing only required once at the end of the trial.Even a single serologic test could be resource-intensive. Approach 7, which only requires testing 10% of the trial participants at the end of the trial, results in accurate estimates of VES ( Figure 2 ) for all values of R0 considered and of VEP (Table 3) for R0 values of 1.25 or 1.50.Only testing 10% of the trial participants once at the end of the trial substantially reduces required resources. However, when the number of cases is very low (Supplementary Table 2 ), the sample does not accurately estimate VEP, and this approach is less efficient than others in many of the settings considered (i.e. wider confidence intervals, see Supplementary Table 3 These approaches work in both trials conducted in one large community and trials conducted in disconnected communities, such as the recent malaria trials (24). In trials with more communities or increased heterogeneity, the bias from heterogeneity in hazard rates will likely be more pronounced (16) . Methods to account for this heterogeneity, such as stratification, metaanalyses, or incorporation of random effects, should therefore be used; although when the number of cases is very low, some of these methods may be imprecise.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/295337 doi: bioRxiv preprint While Approaches 4-7 require substantially fewer resources for estimating VES and VEP than Approach 1 and are more accurate than Approaches 2-3, all participants must be tested at the beginning of the trial to ensure they are not exposed or immune. Including those with preexisting immunity in the trial would reduce the total number of overall cases, and thus the power, limiting the ability to draw a statistically significant conclusion about the vaccine's effects. This challenge however is not limited to diseases with high proportions of mild or asymptomatic infection, as prior immunity would reduce the power of any trial. Additionally, distinguishing between natural and vaccine-derived immunity can be challenging, especially at the beginning of an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease about which not much is known and for which serologic tests are likely in early stages of development (22,25). Therefore, investments in diagnostic development will also be critical for ensuring accurate VE estimates. Finally, many simplifying assumptions are made, including complete ascertainment of infectious cases, perfect sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test, and comparability of the infected vaccinees and infected controls for the estimation of VEP (8) .We have identified methods that accurately estimate VES and VEP and only require serologic testing of trial participants once at the end of the trial. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10% sample yields unbiased VES estimates, significantly reducing required resources. While parameterized for a Zika-like disease, the methods and exact parameters described above are not meant to represent a particular epidemic context, but merely to serve as a guide when thinking through how to accurately estimate important endpoints of vaccine trials in different settings with limited resources and information. R code for this simple model can be readily modified to reflect disease-, vaccine-and setting-specific parameters.

"Abstract

Background: During the first week of March, the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 cases reached over 100 countries with more than 100,000 cases. Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19.A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chisquare test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p<0.05.Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (30.2%) and medical students (29.6%). Regarding COVID-19, most of the participants used social media to obtain information (61%), and a significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (61%) and symptom onset (63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19 prevention and control. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of COVID-19.As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs beyond borders, and further studies are warranted.

","Introduction

Coronavirus (CoV) infections are emerging respiratory viruses and are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] . CoV is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted via animal-to-human and human-to-human interaction [2] . Multiple epidemic outbreaks occurred during 2002 (SARS), with ~800 deaths, and 2012 (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: MERS-CoV), with 860 deaths [2, 3] .Approximately eight years after the MERS-CoV epidemic, the current outbreak of novel coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, has emerged as a global outbreak and significant public health issue [4] . On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) [5] . Astonishingly, in the first week of March, a devastating number of new cases were reported globally, and COVID-19 emerged as a pandemic. As of 12 March 2020, more than 125,000 confirmed cases across 118 countries and more than 4600 deaths had been reported [6] .COVID-19 is spread by human-to-human transmission through droplet, feco-oral, and direct contact and has an incubation period of 2-14 days [6] . To date, no antiviral treatment or vaccine has been explicitly recommended for COVID-19. Therefore, applying preventive measures to control COVID-19 infection is the most critical intervention. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the primary sector in contact with patients and are an important source of exposure to infected cases in healthcare settings; thus, HCWs are expected to be at high risk of infection. By the end of January, the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had published recommendations for the prevention and control of COVID-19 for HCWs [8, 9] . The WHO also initiated several online training sessions and materials on COVID-19 in various languages to strengthen preventive strategies, including raising awareness and training HCWs in preparedness activities [10] .

In this regard, the COVID-19 epidemic offers a unique opportunity to investigate the level of knowledge and perceptions of HCWs during this global health crisis. In addition, we aim to explore the role of different information sources in shaping HCWs' knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 during this peak period.

Methods

A prospective Web-based cross-sectional study was conducted using a survey instrument to obtain responses from HCWs globally during the first week of March 2020.A 23-item survey instrument was developed using WHO course materials on emerging respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 [14] . The survey covered the domains of HCW characteristics, awareness, information sources, knowledge and perceptions related to COVID-19. The developed draft survey instrument was distributed to ten randomly selected faculty members to assess its readability and validity before pretesting among 20 randomly selected HCWs for clarity, relevance, and acceptability. Refinements were made as required to facilitate better comprehension and to organize the questions before the final survey was distributed to the study population.

Content of the study tool

The survey instrument comprised 23 closed-ended questions and took approximately 3 minutes to complete. The 23-item questionnaire was divided into three parts, including participant characteristics (3 items), awareness of COVID-19 (2 items), source of information author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033381 doi: medRxiv preprint 1]. Sufficient time was given to participants to read, comprehend, and answer all the questions.

Ethical considerations

Confidentiality of the study participants' information was maintained throughout the study by making the participants' information anonymous and asking the participants to provide honest answers. Eligible HCWs' participation in this survey was voluntary and was not compensated. Informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to participation.The study was performed following the Helsinki Declaration as revised in 2013. The study was conducted following the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys 

Data analysis

The obtained data were coded, validated, and analyzed using SPSS version 24 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive analysis was applied to calculate the frequencies and proportions. The chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

A total of 529 HCWs participated, 453 of whom completed the study questionnaire (85.6% response rate), including 234 (51.6%) men and 219 (48.3%) women; most of the participants were below 44 years of age (82.4%). The majority of participants were doctors (n=137, 30.2%) or medical students (n=134, 29.6%) and were from Asia (68%). Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants. Almost all participants agreed that they had heard about COVID-19 (97.8%), but only 44.1% of them had the opportunity to attend lectures/discussions about COVID-19..

Source of information

When we asked about the participants' source for reliable information about COVID-19, the primary sources of information about COVID-19 were official government websites and social media ( Figure 1 ). Approximately 30% of the participants reported that they used news media (TV/video, magazines, newspapers, and radio) and social media (Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat) to obtain information about COVID-19.Moreover, nearly 40% of the participants sometimes discussed COVID-19-related topics with family and friends. Table 2 shows the knowledge about COVID-19 among HCWs. We identified significant knowledge gaps between doctors and other HCWs. For instance, approximately two-thirds of doctors and half of allied health workers thought that the origin of COVID-19 was bats (65.7% vs. 55.7%, p<0.05). A high majority of the HCWs (85.6%) agreed that maintaining hand hygiene, covering the nose and mouth while coughing, and avoiding sick patients could help to prevent COVID-19 transmission. A majority of the doctors agreed that COVID-19 could lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death (84%, p<0.05) and that supportive care is the only treatment option that is currently available (83.2%, p<0.05). However, the participants' knowledge about questions related to the mode of transmission and incubation period of COVID-19 was poor (p<0.05).

Perceptions about COVID-19

Over 78% of the HCWs exhibited a positive perception of COVID-19. A high majority of the HCWs knew that sick patients should share their recent travel history (92.7%), that flu vaccination is not sufficient to prevent COVID-19 (90.7%), and that COVID-19 is not fatal (88.5%). In addition, 87% felt that washing hands with soap and water could help to prevent .

Moreover, a significant proportion of the doctors perceived eating well-cooked/handled meat to be safe (83.2%) (p<0.05).Medical students were found to have the perception that flu vaccination is not sufficient to prevent COVID-19 transmission (88%, p<0.05). A large number of allied health workers incorrectly believed that it is not safe to eat well-processed meat during the COVID-19 outbreak (25.3%, p<0.05), that COVID-19 is fatal (21.5%), that there is a delay in symptoms (19.8%), and that flu vaccination is sufficient (19.8%; p<0.05) compared with other participants in the respective groups. However, a finding of considerable concern is that 60% of HCWs used social media as a source of information. Currently, the vast diversity of information available through the Internet, including unverified malicious information, can spread quickly and can misguide HCWs. In particular, health authorities and scientists have warned that widespread misinformation about COVID-19 is a serious concern causing xenophobia worldwide [4, [16] [17] [18] [19] . In this regard, HCWs should carefully evaluate COVID-19-related information and should use scientific and authentic content as information sources.

Discussion

The findings of this study suggest significant knowledge gaps between the amount of information available about COVID-19 and the depth of knowledge among HCWs, particularly about the mode of transmission and incubation period of COVID-19.Additionally, many allied health workers had inaccurate knowledge that COVID-19 can be treated with antivirals and that there is a vaccine available. This is unfortunate because the surge of COVID-19 is globally devastating, and a large number of resources are provided by healthcare authorities to educate HCWs and improve their knowledge about COVID-19. Therefore, our findings were disappointing. Greater encouragement from health authorities is needed to assimilate COVID-19-related knowledge among HCWs, including doctors..

However, discrepancies were identified in the perceptions of different categories of HCWs. For instance, only half (52%) of the HCWs aged 45-65 years believed that the symptoms of COVID-19 appeared as early as 2 to 14 days (p<0.05), and more than a quarter of the medical students thought that eating meat during the outbreak was unsafe.Approximately 20% of allied health workers believed that the flu vaccine is sufficient for COVID-19 prevention. Finally, a vast majority of HCWs strongly agreed that maintaining hygiene activities, reporting recent travel history when individuals are sick, and cleaning the equipment used in wet markets are strongly recommended.

Limitations

We used WHO training material for the detection, prevention, response, and control of COVID-19 to develop a validated questionnaire. The developed questionnaire was pilottested, and open-ended questions were limited to reduce information bias.However, this study has some limitations that should be considered. This is a cross-sectional study conducted online among HCWs during alarming cases reported globally in the first week of March 2020. In addition, the data presented in this study are self-reported and partly dependent on the participants' honesty and recall ability; thus, they may be subject to recall bias. Finally, due to the four-week closure of higher educational institutions in the UAE during the COVID-19 outbreak [16], the institutional review board was not approached.Despite these limitations, our findings provide valuable information about the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs during a peak period of COVID-19.

Conclusion

We identified a significant gap in the source of information, poor knowledge levels, and discrepancies in perceptions of COVID-19 among our study participants. As the global threat .

"Abstract

Recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in China has lead a global pandemic around the world. For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, most countries take two typical intervention strategies: suppression approach like immediately lock-downing cities at epicentre of and mitigation; or mitigation approach that slows down but not stopping epidemic of COVID-19 for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention strategy as the most feasible way to certain country. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducts a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR that access the effectiveness of mitigation, suppression and hybrid interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan. The model first extends traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model by considering one key fact: there is a direct link between Exposed and Recovered population. Then, it defines threshold and parameters to classify two stages of COVID control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan, London, Hubei province and the UK during January, 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results show that 1) Suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduces total exposed and infectious populations, but it has to be consistently maintained at least a period of 90 days (by the middle of April 2020) where its success relies on sufficient support from other parts of China. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period. While the total infectious populations will be doubled, the economic performance of London will be less affected due to limited mobility constraints. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases,

one important issue of fitting practical data is that there are a large portion (like 42.5% in Wuhan) of self-recovered population who are asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. These people might think they have been healthy at home because they did not go to hospital for COVID-19 tests. Early release of intervention intensity might increase a risk of the second breakout. One limitation of our model is that its prediction of infections and deaths depends on a parameter estimation of intervention intensity that presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. We assume that each intervention has the same effect on the reproduction number in different regions over time. The practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or other issues of certain county.

INTRODUCTION

Throughout human history, Infectious diseases (ID), also known as transmissible diseases or communicable diseases, are considered as serious threats to global public health and economics [1] . From the 1918 influenza pandemic in Spain resulting in nearly 50 million deaths in 1920s, to recent ongoing global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) from Wuhan in China killing over 11 thousands people in all over the world [2] , infectious disease is a leading contributor to significant mortality and causes huge losses to society as well as personal family burden. Among a variety of factors leading to emergence and breakout of ID, one primary issue is human mobility where in the cities with developed transportation systems, pathogens can be spread to large geographic space within 

million; daily contacts per person: No Interventions (15), Suppression Intervention (3), Mitigation Intervention (8), and Hybrid intervention (8-3-8-3) every two weeks; Contain phase (90% effectiveness of surveillance and isolation )).

a short period of time. For instance, the ongoing global epidemic outbreak of COVID-19 has spread COVID-19 to at least 146 countries and territories on six continents in 2 months, infecting Wuhan Cases. As shown in Fig.1 with Wuhan as a stimulated case using data from [6] , we demonstrate performance of taking different intervention strategies: a) No interventions: the peak of more than 274 thousands people. Thus in the early stage, many researchers have been working in traditional ID propagation models [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] like SIR, SEIR,.et.al, for understanding COVID-19 transmission with human mobility and predicting outbreak process of epidemics. Meanwhile, as realizing a long period of this battle against COVID-19, many of them recently focus on intervention strategies [8] [9] [10] that balance a trade-off between limited human mobility and potential economic loss in COVID-19 control. It poses an important research area that explores how and when to take what level of interventions in light of multiple natures and capabilities of countries.In traditional compartmental models paradigm in epidemiology, SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) [3] and SEIR (Susceptible -Exposure-Infectious-Recovered) [4] are two popular approaches to stimulate and predict how infectious disease is transmitted from human to human. These two models have defined several variables that represent the number of people in each compartment at a particular time. As implied by the variable function of time, these models are dynamic to reflect the changes and fluctuations of these numbers in each compartment over time. As for the investigation of public health interventions for COVID-19 control in Wuhan, Zhong, et.al [6] introduced a modified SEIR model in prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China, where the results show that under strong public intervention of ""lockdown Hubei"", the epidemic of COVID-19 in China would achieve peak by late February and gradually decline by the end of April 2020. Some other extended models [8] [12] are also proposed for predicting the epidemics of COVID-19 in Wuhan and give some similar forecasts. While above methods demonstrate good performance in prediction of COVID-19 breakout by taking strong public intervention, also named as suppression strategy [13] that aims to reverse epidemic growth, one important challenge is that taking suppression strategy only is to treat disease controls as single-objective optimisation of reducing the overall infectious populations as soon as possible, and require strategic consistency in a long term. In real-world, taking public health intervention strategies is actually a multiple-objective optimisation problem including economic loss and society impacts. Thus, most countries have taken different intervention strategies, like enhanced surveillance and isolation to affected individuals in Singapore [14] , four-stage response plan of the UK [15] , mitigation approaches [13] and even multiple interventions taken in many EU countries. Due to the fact that standalone intervention strategy has apparent merits and limitations, it becomes highly necessary to study the feasibility of intervention strategies to certain country in light of its multiple natures and capabilities.Targeting at this problem, this paper conducts a feasibility study that analyses and compares mitigation and suppression intervention strategies for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and daily infectious populations is up to 2.5 million, but will be completed in 100 days. The epidemics will last a relatively shorter period of 90 days, but lead to more death.. CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . b) Contain phase: taking 90% effectiveness of surveillance and isolation from the second day of confirmed case potentially enables controlling a new outbreak of COVID-19, but it needs to be followed a long time. c). Suppression intervention from the 32 nd day: the peak of daily infectious populations greatly reduces to 30 thousands, but this intervention needs to be followed at least 120 days. Nearly 3 months suppression will lead to high economic loss even crisis. d). Mitigation intervention from the 32 nd day: the peak of daily infectious populations increases to 350 thousands, but the period of taking intervention extends to 150 days. It implies a more death but less economic loss compared to suppression intervention. e). Hybrid intervention of taking both suppression and intervention every 2 weeks: the epidemics of COVID-19 appears a long-term multimodal trend where the peaks of daily infectious populations are about 40-60 thousands. This might lead to less daily critical cases and offer more time to hospital for releasing their resources.Above initial analysis demonstrates the complexity and difficulty of how and when to take what level of interventions. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model: SEMCR to analysis this challenge. The model extends traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model by considering one key fact: there is a direct link between Exposed and Recovered population. Then, it defines threshold and parameters to classify two stages of COVID control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan, London, Hubei province and the UK during January, 2020 and March 2020. For each point, we design and set up experimental protocols for comparison and exploration, highlighting following multi-fold contributions:



Suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduces total exposed and infectious populations, but it has to be consistently maintained at least a period of 90 days (by the middle of April 2020) where its success relies on sufficient support from other parts of China. In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period. While the total infectious populations will be doubled, the economic performance of London will be less affected due to limited mobility constraints. Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data is that there are a large portion (like 42.5% in Wuhan) of self-recovered population who are asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. These people might think they have been healthy at home because they did not go to hospital for COVID-19 tests. Early release of intervention intensity might increase a risk of the second breakout.One limitation of our model is that its prediction of infections and deaths depends on a parameter estimation of intervention intensity that presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. We assume that each intervention has the same effect on the reproduction number in different regions over time.The practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or other issues of certain county.The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 introduces an extended SEIR model for controlling COVID-19 breakout. In the Section 3, the materials and implementation of experiment are reported. Section 4 provides detailed experimental evaluation and discussion. The conclusion and future directions are given in Section 5. Fig.2 . Here, we assume that susceptible population E is initial susceptible population of certain region; and  represents the effectiveness of intervention (strict surveillance and isolation) in Contain phase. If effectiveness of intervention in contain phase is not sufficiently strong, susceptible individuals may contract the disease with a given rate when in contact with a portion of exposed population (asymptomatic but infectious) E. After a incubation period, the exposed individuals become the infectious population I (sympotomatic) at a ratio  . Notably, infectious population starts from mild cases M to ciritial cases C at a ratio a. Finally, a portion d of critical cases lead to deaths; the rest of infectious population will be recovered.

Figure 2: Extended SEMCR model structure:

The population is divided into the following six classes: susceptible, exposed (and not yet symptomatic), infectious (symptomatic), mild (mild or moderate symptom), critical (sever symptom), death and recovered (ie, isolated, recovered, or otherwise non-infectious).There are two enhanced features in our model in comparison to popular SEIR models [6] [8] [12] . The first one is a straightforward relationship between Exposed and Recovered population. It is based on our observation that in the early breakout of COVID-19, some portion of exposed people may have no obvious symptoms or only develop as mild cases, but they might be not able to get an official test due to lack of testing kits. This group of populations might be self-recovered in some days, but will not realize they have actually been infected.. CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .The second feature in our model is that we separate infectious population into mild and critical cases in light of their symptoms. It mainly concerns a phenomena of relatively higher mortality rate in the early breakout of COVID-19 in Wuhan after taking immediate suppression intervention on 23 rd Jan 2020. Most likely, suppression intervention has led to fear in Wuhan citizens and chaos in hospital systems, as a result of delaying rescue of many critical cases. Therefore, by introducing above two features in our model, it will be helpful for evaluating positive and negative effects of different interventions. If we assumed the overall population of a certain region is N, the number of days is t, the dynamic transmissions of each components of our model are defined as follow:Regarding Mild cases, Critical cases and Death, the dynamic transmission is as below:Lastly, we define a benchmark in SEMCR model to reflect the strength of intervention over time, as Mt. It is presented by average number of contacts per person per day in a region.

Implementation of dynamic transmission of SEMCR

In order to apply the SEMCR model into practical cases, it needs to estimate the defined parameters in last section, including β, σ and γ 1 , γ 2 , a, b, where β is the product of the people exposed to each day by confirmed infected people (k) and the probability of transmission (b) when exposed (i.e., β= kb) and σ is the incubation rate which is the rate of latent individuals becoming symptomatic (average duration of incubation is 1/σ).According to recent report [8] , the incubation period of COVID-19 has been reported to be between 2 to 14 days, we chose the midpoint of 7 days. γ is the average rate of recovery or death in infected populations. Using epidemic data from [6] , we modeled the SEMCR model to determine the probability of transmission (b) which was used to derive β and the probability of recovery or death (γ). The number of people who stay susceptible in each region is similar to that of its total resident population. Other transmission parameters are estimated with early prediction of Hubei cases in [6] on January 23 2020 using Monte Carlo simulation, as shown in the Table. 1Notably, as for the strength of intervention M, it is closely related to the population density in a region. We use a benchmark reported in [6] that assumes Hubei province with no intervention as M = 15, and after suppression intervention, M reduced to 3. When applying SEMCR model into other simulated cases, M should be initialized according to the population density and human mobility in these places. Also, after taking any kind of interventions, the change of M should follow a reasonable decline or increase over few days, not immediately occur at the second day. Following previous assumptions, the implementation of dynamic transmission of SEMCR model follows steps as below:.

Model evaluation protocol

In order to utilise our proposed SEMCR model into practical cases, we design an evaluation protocol to access multiple effects of taking different intervention strategies to control breakout of COVID-19 in 4 typical cases, including Hubei province, Wuhan city, the UK and London, as shown in Fig.3 .The first stage is initial parameters estimation using COVID-19 data from four cases: Hubei, Wuhan, UK and London. In this stage, a preliminary qualitative assessment of each case is performed, by comparing their similarity and dissimilarity on area, transportation, population density, migration flows, date of the first confirmed case, etc. We would determine value of initial parameters in the SEMCR including N, Mt, and date of the first confirmed case. Notably, in Wuhan, the date of the first confirmed case is not officially released. The work [8] estimates the first confirmed case is by the end of Nov 2019; and Zhong [11] points out the first confirmed case in Wuhan is on 23nd December 2019. Here, we take the same settings of first confirmed case on 23nd December 2019. The next step is to estimate and normalize other parameters in the model. Assuming that COVID-19 has similar transmission ratio and incubation rate in all four cases, we use parameter values fitted from [11] , where incubation rate is 1/7; the rate of transmission for the I to S is 0.157; the rate of transmission for the E to S is 0.787. As for estimation of other parameters, we follow the COVID-19 official report from WHO [15] , including the proportion of Mild, Severe and Critical cases, the probability of death, etc.Thirdly, how to take intervention strategies needs to be evaluated by tuning parameters in SEMCR model. The key tuning operation is to adjust the level of Mt over a period. For instance, we assume that no intervention strategies result in unaltered internal mobility of a region, taking suppression strategy in Wuhan means a reduction of M to 3. But in other cases with larger area, it is extremely difficult to take a complete suppression strategy. So the reduction of M will be relatively adjusted to 4 or 5.Final stage, we perform quantitative analysis of effectiveness of different intervention strategies, including: strict surveillance and isolation, suppression strategy, mitigation strategy, and multiple intervention. The evaluation metric of cross-validation is employed to evaluate the performance of COVID-19 progression model. The final two evaluation indicators are the length of intervention and the peak time. The length of intervention is calculated due the date that confirmed cases are nearly clear to zero.

Data collection

The most recent epidemiological data based on daily COVID-19 outbreak numbers reported by the National Health Commission of China were retrieved. Also regarding the daily update from world meter, we record the number of confirmed cases and death each day in four cases. In order to stimulate four cases, we require the exact confirmed cases in the first 2-5 days to initialise parameters of our model.

Evaluation of cases with no interventions

We first simulate four cases that predict the breakout of COVID-19 without taking any interventions. The initial populations are given as London (9.3 million), Wuhan (14.18 million), UK (66.49 million) and Hubei (58.9 million). The parameter M representing average number of contacts per person per day is given as 15 to London, Wuhan and Hubei; 12 to the UK. The simulation results are given in Figure. 4.The results show that in the peak time, there will be up to 100K, 200K, 450K and 900K exposed population that are infection but no symptoms at London, Wuhan, UK and Hubei. This implies that: 1) the total infectious population of these four cases will be 7.68 million in London, 12.15 million in Wuhan, 50.45 million in Hubei and 47.98 million in the UK. 2) The total death of these four cases will be 761K in London, 120K in Wuhan, 0.493 million in Hubei and 0.475 million in the UK. It equals to about over 80% of total population of each region will be infectious, with the morality rate nearly 1%. The above figures show that without intervention, the breakout of COVID-19 will lead to huge infectious population and deaths. The main reason is that COVID-19 is estimated as relatively high production number R0 equals to 3 [14] , where the transmission ratio β2 from Susceptible to Exposed is up to 78%. Thus, in some regions with high migration and dense population, it will easily lead to a breakout.However, one notable issue is that the initialisation of parameter M seems to impact on the occurrence of peak time and the length of overall period. In the cases of London, Wuhan and Hubei with M = 15, their peak time are all roughly on the 60 th day from the date of first confirmed case; but UK with M = 12, their peak time is delayed to the 100 th day from the date of first confirmed case. That means to regions with similar total population, the low population density will reduce overall infectious population, but delay the peak time of breakout as a result of longer period.

Effectiveness of surveillance and isolation

As for the strategy of taking surveillance and isolation intervention in the contain phase, recent study [15] has developed a stochastic transmission model parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. It proves that highly effective contact tracing and case isolation can control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months, where for a production number R0 of 3.5, more than 90% contacts had to be traced. Thus, we plan to transfer this finding as a tuning parameter β2 to evaluate if the outbreak of COVID-19 could be controlled.Considering that 90% of contacts had to be traced, it implies that the surveillance and isolation is effective to scale down the group of contacts. In other words, we stimulate a situation that from the second day of receiving confirmed case, only 5% of the overall population will be possible to contact the infectious ones. Then, the β2 = 0.05. The results are shown in the Fig.5 . The results show that in all four cases, the outbreak of COVID-19 has been successfully controlled, and has no peak time. There will be only 44, 56, 42 and 120 people that are infection and finally recovered at London, Wuhan, UK and Hubei. The overall period of COVID outbreak is less than 100 days. This finding is same as the proof in [15] .

When taking highly effective surveillance and isolation, the transmission of COVID-19 has been limited and controlled within a small group of population. The population difference will not affect the total infectious ones. But in the UK case with M = 12, low population density will limit the effectiveness of surveillance and isolation, as a result of more infectious population. It implies another fact that to these countries with low population density, it is challenging to take high quality of intervention like surveillance and isolation.Then, we evaluate when the outbreak of COVID-19 could occur by adjusting the value of parameter β2 in the UK case. As shown in Table. 2, we record the total recovered population, and if there is a peak of breakout. As the increased β2, the total recovered population is dramatically increased and generates a peak as β2 = 0.075. That means that if we cannot guarantee at least 92.5% of UK population are not contacted by infectious people, it is indispensable to have an outbreak of COVID-19. Meanwhile, if the isolation intervention is less ineffective; the more population will be infectious; and the peak day will be brought forwarded. Thus, in the early stage of control COVID-19, taking high effective surveillance and isolation in any regions is necessary to avoid the outbreak of COVID-19. 

Effectiveness of Suppression Intervention

The suppression strategy is widely recognised as the most effective solution to reduce the infectious population, where it was taken in Wuhan on 23nd January 2020. In the work [11] , Zhong has reported that taking suppression strategy has successfully limits the overall infectious population in Hubei on 22 nd February 2020 to 50K. And if the suppression strategy was taken one week earlier, this figure would reduce to 18K. Thus, we would like to simulate the situation of taking suppression strategy in London. The parameter M is given as 15 to 4 in London, in comparison to Wuhan from 15 to 3. The simulation results are given in Figure. 6.The results show that by taking suppression strategy, the cases in Wuhan and London appear a quite similar trend that daily exposed and infectious population will be greatly reduced. The outbreak of COVID-19 will be controlled by the 100 th days, and can be nearly ended by the 150 th days. The difference is that the daily infectious population of London will be nearly double to the ones in Wuhan. It is probably because we stimulate the date of taking suppression strategy in Wuhan (the 32 nd day) is 3 days earlier than London (the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . 35 th day). Another possible reason is that considering the impact of culture difference, the value of M is only limited to 4 in London, but not as lower as 3 in Wuhan. In fact, the suppression in Wuhan is actually applied to limit mobility in community level, which is hard to be followed by London.We also consider another two situations of taking suppression intervention 1 week earlier or 1 week later in London, as shown in Fig.6 . The results show that the overall infectious population will be greatly reduced to 35 thousands if taking actions one week earlier; oppositely it will increase to 1.5 million infection if taking actions one week later.However, two important issues of taking suppression strategy are the intervention length and the peak time. In order to effectively control the breakout, the intervention length of taking actions at above three timing points all require at least 100 days. It potentially leads to significant side effects to economic and society, including job loss, mental health, etc. Also, the peak time will arrive earlier than its nature transmission if taking actions one week earlier. This might increase a shorter time to government for preparing sufficient resources, and causing more difficulties in control the breakout of COVID-19.

Effectiveness of Mitigation Intervention

The mitigation strategy is recently highlighted by researchers from Imperial College [16] [17] , where this strategy was initially taken by UK government. The aim of mitigation is to use other strategies like drugs to help individuals so that not to interrupt transmission completely, but to reduce the health impacts of an epidemic. In this cases, population immunity builds up through the epidemic, leading to an eventual rapid decline in case numbers and transmission dropping to low levels. Thus, we simulate the situation of the UK by taking mitigation strategy with different level of strengths. The parameter M representing average number of contacts per person per day is given as 12 to the UK, and gradually reduced to 10 and 8 from the 32 th day of first confirmed case. The simulation results are given in Figure. 7.The results show that firstly taking mitigation strategy is effective to reduce daily infectious population, further lead to huge reduction of total infectious population. By reducing the parameter of M from 12 to 10 or 8, the peak of daily infectious population is reduce from 4.5 million to 2.5 million or 1 million. On the other hand, the peak time of infectious population will be delayed as taking mitigation intervention, where the peak dates of infectious population at M = 12, 10 and 8 are roughly on the 80 th , 110 th and 170 th days. The overall period of breakout will be extended from 180 days to 200 or 250 days.Thus, above simulated figures appear a similar trend as findings from [17] . Taking mitigation intervention in the UK is capable of reducing the impact of an epidemic by flattening the curve, reducing peak incidence and overall death. While total infectious population may increase over a longer period, the final mortality ratio may be minimised at the end. But as similar as taking suppression strategy, the mitigation interventions need to remain in place for as much of the epidemic period as possible. However, the timing of introducing this mitigation intervention is important, where too early execution may allow transmission to return once they are lifted and sufficient author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . 7 ""herd immunity"" has not been developed. Thus, it is necessary to balance the timing of introduction with the scale of disruption imposed and the likely period over which the interventions can be maintained.

Effectiveness of hybrid intervention

In terms of above discussion, the effectiveness of taking any one intervention (either suppression or mitigation) is likely to be limited. It is highly necessary to consider the possibility of taking multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on social and economic cost reduction. Thus, we have simulated one simple situation of taking multiple strategy in London from the 35 days, by giving a hybrid of suppression and mitigation strategies every two weeks. The M is given as a pattern of 6-4.5-3-4.5-6 in London, where it means mitigation and suppression strategies are taken in an every two weeks roll. For minimizing side effects of taking interventions on human mobility, the application of first mitigation to reduce M from 12 to 6 spends 2 days. The simulation results are given in Figure. 8.The results show that the epidemic appears a multi-modal decline trend over 500 days. The first peak of infectious population occurs on the 50 th days with 1000 infections after taking suppression intervention to reduce M from 12 to 3. After two weeks, mitigation strategies are taken so that the second peak of infectious population rises up to 750 infections. The total infectious population will be 530K over 500 days; the deaths will be limited to 520.Apparently, taking multiple intervention in the UK is capable of reducing the impact of an epidemic by fluctuating the curve, reducing overall infections and death. While the total period will be extended, final mortality ratio may be minimised at the end. But the longer period of limiting human mobility might increase economic risks and reduce employment ratio. There will be plenty of choices to taking multiple interventions through adjusting the strength and length of intervention. The consequence possibility show a similar multimodal curve but with different peak incidence.

DISCUSSION AND LIMITATION

As we mentioned in section 1, the question on how and when to take what level of interventions to control an epidemic is highly challenging, particularly in light of multiple natures and capabilities of countries. In many cases, it is even hard to evaluate effectiveness until the end of epidemic, and there is always controversy on taking any one intervention. However, our findings contribute to several useful suggestions on controlling COVID-19 breakout.The first point is that highly effective surveillance and isolation strategy is necessary to control an epidemic in early stage. In theory, if this strategy can be executed in excellent level, there will be no huge breakout later on. The case in Wuhan is a sample that have not taken any effective surveillance and isolation in the early stage of COVID-19, resulting of huge difficulties on late interventions. Also, considering the area, transportation, migration flows and population density of a region, most countries cannot achieve excellent level of isolation in contain phase, probably only in fine or good level. The breakout of an epidemic is avoidable. But considering its low social and economic cost, this strategy is still a very cost-effective option.Secondly, the cases in Wuhan and London has demonstrated high effectiveness of suppression strategy to reduce the overall infection. Probably in the UK or similar countries, suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. But its practical effectiveness is not possible to achieve as same as Wuhan, as the success of suppression strategy in Wuhan is based on locking down human mobility to community level and sufficient resource support from other cities or provinces in China. If there are no sufficient external support, it will be risky to take intensive suppression to entire country due to huge impacts on its economics. Also, taking such intensive intervention to control an epidemic will need to be maintained until vaccine released (up to 12 months or more). If intensive interventions are relaxed at any time points, the transmission will quickly rebound. This is more like a multi-modal curve when taking multi-intervention strategies..

"Abstract

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/ 2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has caused great damage to public health and economy worldwide with over 140,000 infected cases up to date. Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts .

Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r 2 >0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak. This model could provide more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.

","INTRODUCTION

In the first season of 2020, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2 or 2019-nCoV) 1 has spread all over the world and had a great impact on public health and worldwide economy. This new virus has some relations to SARS-CoV but it is more aggressive than SARS, MERS, or the seasonal influenza 2 . It has exhibited relatively high human-to-human transmissibility compared to other coronavirus infections 3 To predict epidemic trend, meteorological conditions are suggested to be an important factor as well as population mobility and human-to-human contact. These meteorological factors such as humidity, visibility, and wind speed can affect droplet stability in the environment, or affect survival of viruses as air temperature does, and thus impact epidemic transmission. Air temperature and absolute humidity have been indicated to significantly influence the transmission of COVID-19. However, there are only five studies published on preprint hubs discussed the involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of COVID-19 up to now, and they all focused on data from China without model validation or prediction.Herein, this study intends to investigate the relationship between meteorological factors and epidemic transmission rate at a systematical level on the world scale.

Those cities with over 50 confirmed cases monthly were taken as a discovery dataset to exclude the confounding effect due to purely imported cases. Four time points delay of the weather conditions from the day of epidemic situation evaluation were considered and compared to find the most possible time delay that best reveals the relationship between weather and COVID-19 outbreak. A multivariate polynomial regression model with factors of wind speed, relative humidity, and average air temperature was established, and then validated in 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Finally, we use this model, in combination with weather forecast, to predict the probable outbreak in several high-latitude big cities around the world.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Epidemiological data. Epidemiological data were collected from various sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) 4 , China Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (especially for data in Italy), Japan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and DXY-COVID-19-Data, a Chinese website that aggregates national and local CCDC situation reports in near real-time 5 . The daily new confirmed case counts were collected from January 20, 2020 (i.e., WHO published the first situation report) to March 11, 2020 . For China, incidence data were collected for every city or district, leading to 430 sites covering the whole country. Considering the potential confounding effect, only cities with no less than 50 cumulative confirmed cases in one month and without official reports of imported cases in majority were taken into a discovery dataset. A second set of cities with 10~49 cumulative confirmed cases in one month was taken as an replication dataset (so called replication_China). For Italy and Japan, incidence data were collected for each province/ city/ district, in total, 21 .

For other countries, only incidence data at the country level were obtained. We scrutinized WHO's situation reports to rule out these countries with only imported cases, and only collected the confirmed cases with possible or confirmed local transmission (i.e., without recent travel history to China). The top 11 countries with high incidence of COVID-19 local transmission except China were selected for a replication dataset representing the world's situation (so called replication_world).Weather data. We obtained hourly values of meteorological observations from the Integrated Surface Database of USA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd) 6 . Temperature and dew point displayed in Fahrenheit were transformed into Celsius forms, and relative humidity (RH) was calculated from temperature and dew point using the following formula for each time point:where RH is the relative humidity, D is the dew point in degrees Celsius, T is the temperature in degrees Celsius, and e is the base of the natural log.Daily data were calculated by averaging the hourly data for each variable in each day.For each city with epidemiological data, the meteorological station in that city or that was closest to the latitude and longitude coordinates of the city center was chosen. For a city with more than one meteorological stations, the one nearest to the city center was chosen. For a province with epidemiological data, the meteorological station in the capital city of that province was chosen. For a country with only nation-wide epidemiological data, weather data were averaged across all the meteorological stations in the cities where outbreak was officially reported. For Japan, the surveillance table of epidemiology only provides weekly data, thus daily weather of each week was averaged to obtain weekly meteorological data..

The number of confirmed new cases on each day was taken as a dependent variable. Four meteorological variables, namely, air temperature, wind speed, visibility, and relative humidity, were taken as independent variables.Considering that there is a latency stage from the day one get infected to the day being confirmed, a time delay of the day COVID-19 was confirmed from the day weather data were collected needs to be taken into consideration. As it is reported that the latency period for COVID-19 is 3~7 days on average and 14 days at most, four time points delay of virus infection were taken into consideration, that is, weather data were collected on the day, three days before, seven days before, 14 days before collecting the epidemiological data. At first, each meteorological variable was plotted against the confirmed new case counts for the Wuhan dataset, with four time delays display on one plot. Only one city Wuhan was chosen for illustrating the time delay effect because it is the original city where SARS-CoV2 was first uncovered, there could not be any imported cases for Wuhan, which might obscure the correlation between weather and virus transmission. A Loess regression interpolation approach was adopted to visually identify the relationship between meteorological variables and confirmed new case counts. After choosing the appropriate time delay, data from the discovery dataset were fitted into generalized linear model or non-linear model (basically polynomial and inverse models) according to the indentified relationship by Loess regression. Each of the four meteorological variables was fitted into models solely, and then two or three variables were combined together to fit complex models.All these models were compared with the full model, to find a best fitted model with not many factors. Basic statistics and modeling was conducted in R 3.5.1 7 (mainly ""glm"", ""nls"", ""ggplot"" packages).Model validation and application. The best fitted model was validated in the replication datasets (replication_world, replication_Italy, and replication_Japan) by correlating the real epidemiological data with the predicted values from the model.We used this best fitted model to predict future COVID-19 daily confirmed new cases with weather observations and forecasts in a sequence of 15 days for seven .

The effects of all these four factors on confirmed new cases 14 days later all exhibited a parabolic or bell-shaped trend ( Figure 1 ). Thus, in the following analyses, epidemiological data were correlated with the weather data 14 days ago..

To fit the model with more data and thus more accuracy, we used the discovery dataset for modeling. In the model, temperature and wind speed were regarded as quadric-related, relative humidity was regarded as cubic-related, and visibility was regarded as inverse-related.

When further reducing variables in the model to obtain a most parsimony and best fitted prediction model, we got better results. When visibility was removed from the model, the predicted values of the fitted model were more significantly correlated with the observed epidemiological data (r 2 = 0.624, p = 6.113e-05 for replication_world; r 2 = 0.287, p = 0.034 for replication_Italy; see Figure 5B & 6). This model, written as follows, was also best fitted compared to the full model and other 3-factor and 2-factor models, with the smallest AIC.case counts = -0.18T 2 + 3.1628T -0.4385SPD 2 + 21.1420SPD -228.4231RH 3 -391.9561RH 2 + 880. in which T is temperature, SPD is wind speed, RH is relative humidity, VSB.When there were only wind speed and relative humidity in the model, we got a prediction that was most significantly correlated with the real data (r 2 = 0.637, p = 3.884e-05 for replication_world; r 2 = 0.310, p = 0.021 for replication_Italy; see .

Figure 8 showed the predicted daily case counts curve. It shows that COVID-19 outbreak in Milan and Toronto will sustain in the future 12 days, but exhibits a transient decrease on March 26; virus transmission in Paris and Cologne will increase and reached a peak on March 26, but quickly drop down after that day; the epidemic trend in New York will fluctuate in the following days..

According to this theory, the year 2020 is predicted to be warm and dry, and plague often outbreaks in warm winter, so respiratory infectious diseases would be frequent in 2020. This theory and its inference are consistent with the current epidemic situation of COVID-19.Previous studies have already implied the spread of many respiratory infectious diseases like influenza is dependent upon air temperature and relative humidity 8, 9 .Recent published papers 10- is an optimal temperature for SARS-CoV2 at 8.07 ℃ and most cities with high epidemic transmission of COVID-19 locate in the humidity range of 60% ~ 90%, which is colder and more humid than Bu et al's suggestions. It might be due to that their conclusion was based on SARS data and their data collection was much earlier.Our optimal temperature 8.07 ℃ is very close to the estimation by Wang et al, which is 8.72℃ 13 . Oliveiros et al. regressed the doubling time of COVID-19 cases by temperature and humidity, and they did not find significant association for wind speed 14 . In our study, though wind speed was not an important factor if modeled singly, it is a necessary factor in the final model and adding wind speed in the model would significantly improve model prediction performance.

It suggests that caution about outbreak should be taken if visibility drops below 10 statute miles to nearest tenth. Upon now, all of these studies focused only on data from China, with very few worldwide data implemented. Our research investigated the worldwide data more thoroughly and explored a set of meteorological factors systematically.None of the published research has considered the influence of imported cases in modeling. In our study, when collecting epidemiological data for other countries in the world, those cases with travel history to China or indicated by WHO as ""imported case only"" were excluded, leaving the world data most likely local transmitted.However, it's difficult to separate the imported cases from local transmission for Chinese cities, as there was a dramatic and complex migration due to Spring Festival.It might explain why the predicted values for Wuhan and countries other than China correlated with the observed data much better than those for Chinese cities other than Wuhan. Future research should investigate the epidemiological data more carefully and thoroughly to distinguish imported cases and local transmission. A final prediction model is proposed in the current study, which is easy to use for estimating the future 14-day epidemic trend of COVID-19 by using weather observations in the past two weeks. However, if strict control on population movement and clustering is implemented, the real case counts might deviate from the predicted values. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037168 doi: medRxiv preprint

RESULTS

There were in total 39,888 confirmed cases in Wuhan, and 14,511 confirmed cases in 59 Chinese cities /districts with monthly confirmed cases no less than 50, therefore, the discovery dataset was consisted of 1133 records of data with 54,399 confirmed cases in 60 cities in China. The confirmed new cases in Wuhan on February 13, 2020, reached 13,436, which was oddly high as the daily confirmed new cases were no larger than 3,000 on all the other dates in Wuhan or in all the other cities. We suppose that it might be due to supplement of enough virus test kits on that day. In order to reduce the potential contamination of modeling by this outlier, we substituted the counts on that day by four, that was 13,436/4=3,359, which was still the largest number but not deviated from the dataset too much. Except this outlier, the daily confirmed new cases in the discovery dataset ranged from 1 to 2997, the average temperature ranged -23.54℃ ~ 22.85℃, the wind speed ranged 1.33 ~ 26 miles per hour, visibility ranged 0.425 ~ 110 statute miles to nearest tenth, and relative humidity ranged 31.4% ~ 100%. The temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity ranges in the other replication datasets were similar to the discovery dataset, while the maximum visibility in the replication datasets was lower than that in the discovery dataset (Table 1) . .

Loess regression interpolation curves with 95% confidence intervals in shadow were illustrated for each dataset.

To elucidate the contribution of each meteorological factor to the case counts, we first performed single-factor non-linear regression modeling for each meteorological variable in the Wuhan dataset as well as in the discovery dataset. Temperature and wind speed were fitted into quadratic models; relative humidity was fitted into a cubic model; visibility was fitted into two models, an inverse model when modeling in the discovery dataset and a quadratic model when modeling in the Wuhan dataset because distribution of visibility in the two datasets was different. We used these fitted models to calculate a predicted value for case counts for each studied site, and then compared this predicted value with the real observed case counts by calculating a Pearson's correlation coefficient between them. Model fitting results showed that using the Wuhan dataset for single-factor modeling produced better model fitness. There was 0.40, 0.24, and 0.35 correlation between the observed data for Wuhan and values predicted by average air temperature, relative humidity, and visibility, separately, while wind speed alone could not explain much of the variance in confirmed case counts ( Figure 4 ). According to the equation, SARS-CoV2 transmission reaches a peak when the air temperature is 8.07 ℃, or when the wind speed is 16.1 mile/hr, or when the visibility is 2.99 statute miles to nearest tenth, or when the relative humidity is 64.6%..

Introduction

The pandemic Coronavirus-disease 19 (COVID-19) is characterized clinically by a highly variable course. While most patients experience only mild symptoms, a relevant proportion develop severe disease progression with increasing hypoxia up to acute respiratory distress syndrome. About 5% of patients require intensive care treatment including mechanical ventilation. [1] [2] [3] This variability of COVID-19 and the shortage of health care resources in heavily affected regions make efficient allocation of resources towards patients at high risk for deterioration crucial. 4 We aimed to identify variables that allow the prediction of patients with a high risk of respiratory failure and need of mechanical ventilation.

Methods

All patients with PCR proven symptomatic COVID-19 infection hospitalized at our institution from 29 th February to 27 th March 2020 (n=40) were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings. Decision on endotracheal intubation was made following internationally accepted recommendations (PaO2/FiO2 <150mmHg). 5 Patient data were anonymized for analysis and the study was approved by the local ethics committee (No: 20-245). All variables with less than 50% of missing data were tested for the association with respiratory failure. Categorical variables were compared with the χ 2 -test, and numerical variables were tested with the Mann-Whitney-U-Test. The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing with the Bonferroni-Holm-Method. An adjusted p-value (q-value) of ≤0.05 was considered significant.

Results

In total, 13/40 (32.5%) patients deteriorated during hospitalization and required mechanical ventilation. The time from hospital admission to intubation varied from less than one hour to 9 days (median 2 days). All patients who required intubation were of male sex, compared to 59% of males in the group that did not require intubation (p=0.020, q=0.057). Patients requiring mechanical ventilation did not differ in age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score (table) .Pulse, markers of inflammation, LDH and creatinine at admission were associated with respiratory failure (table). Elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) was very strongly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (figure 1A, p=1.2·10 -5 , q=0.00032).In addition to IL-6 values at first assessment, follow-up data on IL-6 were also available (median number of values per patient: 6, range 1-10). These data were used to assess the maximal IL-6 level for each patient during disease (for patients requiring ventilation, only values before intubation were used). These values predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (figure 1B/C, p=1.7·10 -8 , AUC=0.98). The statistically optimal cutoff for IL-6 was 80 pg/ml, identifying all but one patient with respiratory failure correctly, and misclassifying only one patient that still does not require intubation. The risk of respiratory failure for patients with IL-6 levels of ≥80 pg/ml was 92% and thus 22 times higher compared to patients with lower IL-6 levels. After reaching an IL-6 value of 80pg/ml, the median time to mechanical ventilation was 1.5 days (range 0-4 days).

Discussion

Even though IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in patients requiring ventilation, they are relatively low compared to levels observed in patients with septic shock. 6 Our data suggests that even moderately elevated IL-6 levels above 80pg/ml are sufficient to identify COVID-19 patients with a high risk of respiratory failure. Further studies and larger sample sizes will be needed to validate our findings and possibly determine a more accurate cutoff. To date, it is unclear whether IL-6 merely represents a biomarker or a central pathogenetic element of severe COVID-19 that should be used as a parameter for therapeutic intervention.In the current situation with overwhelmed intensive care units and overcrowded emergency rooms, correct triage of patients in need of intensive care is crucial. Our study shows that IL-6 is an effective marker that might be able to predict upcoming respiratory failure with high accuracy and help physicians correctly allocate patients at an early stage.

"Abstract

The respiratory tract surface is protected from inhaled pathogens by a secreted layer of mucus that is rich in mucin glycoproteins. Disrupted mucus production is a cardinal feature of chronic respiratory diseases but how this alteration affect interactions between mucins and pathogens is complex and poorly understood. Here, we identify a central and unexpected role for the major airway mucin MUC5AC in pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Virus induction of MUC5AC is augmented in COPD compared to healthy subjects, is enhanced in frequent exacerbators and correlates with inflammation, symptom severity and secondary bacterial infection during exacerbation. MUC5AC is functionally related to inflammation as MUC5ACdeficient (Muc5ac-/-) mice had attenuated rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation whilst exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein administration augmented virus-induced inflammatory responses and bacterial load. Mechanistically, MUC5AC-augmentation of rhinovirus-induced inflammation occurred through release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Therapeutic suppression of virus-induced MUC5AC release using an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor ameliorated exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses in a mouse COPD exacerbation model. Collectively, these studies demonstrate previously unrecognised pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC during infection and thus highlight a key unforeseen role in driving COPD exacerbation severity.author/funder.

","INTRODUCTION

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory airway disorder punctuated by acute exacerbations, frequently precipitated by rhinoviruses (RVs) 1,2 . Exacerbations are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in COPD 3, 4 and a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is urgently needed to facilitate development of new therapies to reduce the impact of these debilitating episodes.Respiratory mucosal surfaces are continuously exposed to inhaled pathogens and a protective layer of secreted mucus that is rich in mucin glycoproteins acts as a first-line of defense against infection. Alterations in mucus secretion including enhancement of the major airway mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B are a cardinal feature of inflammatory airway COPD [5] [6] [7] . The complexity of interactions between mucins and pathogens and how the perturbations in mucin expression that occur in COPD affect infection susceptibility and subsequent exacerbation pathogenesis are poorly understood and it is not known whether inhibition of mucus production would be beneficial or harmful in this context.Animal studies have revealed critical roles for MUC5AC and MUC5B in anti-viral and antibacterial host-defense 8, 9 suggesting that use of anti-secretory therapies may compromise a protective role for mucins during exacerbations. Conversely, mucin levels are higher in COPD patients who experience frequent exacerbations 7 raising speculation for a possible functional role in exacerbation pathogenesis. Additionally, accumulation of small airway mucus-containing inflammatory exudates has been shown to be associated with early death in patients with COPD treated by lung volume reduction surgery 10 and airway MUC5AC mediates airway hyperresponsiveness 11 and is over-expressed in cases of fatal asthma 12 , suggesting that mucins could be a marker or cause of adverse outcome. These studies would support the opposing view that targeted suppression of mucins during exacerbations might provide desirable improvement in outcomes.Here, using human studies in combination with functional experiments in mouse models, we identify a central and unforeseen role for MUC5AC in amplifying virus-induced airway inflammation and driving subsequent exacerbation severity in COPD. We identify a mechanism for augmentation of virus-induced inflammation by MUC5AC through release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and show that therapeutic suppression of virusinduced MUC5AC release using an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor ameliorates exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses in a mouse COPD exacerbation model.

MUC5AC is induced during naturally-occurring COPD exacerbations and enhanced in frequent exacerbators

We initially evaluated the expression of the major mucin glycoproteins MUC5AC and MUC5B in sputum samples taken from COPD patients during virus-associated naturallyoccurring exacerbations (Fig.1a) in our community-based cohort study. A total of 27 exacerbations were reported, of which 18 exacerbations (67%) were associated with positive virus detection by PCR of sputum samples (rhinovirus n=11, coronavirus n=4, RSV n=2, influenza n=1) as previously reported. 13 These 18 virus-positive exacerbation samples were used for analyses (see Table 1 for the clinical characteristics of the subjects reporting these 18 exacerbations). Significant increases from baseline were observed for sputum supernatant MUC5AC protein concentrations at exacerbation presentation and at 2 weeks during exacerbation with no significant increase observed for MUC5B protein (Fig.1b) .During exacerbation, peak concentrations of MUC5AC (i.e. maximal concentrations detected during exacerbation) protein were increased compared to baseline with no significant increase observed for MUC5B (Fig.1c) . Frequent exacerbators (patients with a history of >2 exacerbations in the preceding year) had increased sputum MUC5AC concentrations at exacerbation presentation and at 2 weeks during exacerbation compared with infrequent exacerbators (0 or 1 exacerbations in the preceding year), with no significant differences observed for MUC5B (Fig. 1d) .Given that ELISA-based quantification of sputum mucins may be influenced by proteases present in this sample type 14 , we further confirmed our observations using quantitative PCR to measure mucin expression in RNA extracted from sputum cells from the same subjects.In keeping with our findings for mucin proteins, we also observed that sputum MUC5AC mRNA was significantly increased at exacerbation onset with no increase observed for MUC5B mRNA (Fig 1e) , providing additional evidence that MUC5AC is the major induced mucin during naturally-occurring COPD exacerbations.

COPD is associated with augmented MUC5AC responses to experimental rhinovirus challenge

We next utilised our previous human RV challenge studies 1, 15 to more accurately define the temporal dynamics of mucin expression during RV-induced COPD exacerbations ( Fig.2a and Supplementary Fig.1a )(Clinical characteristics of these subjects are shown in Table 2 ). author/funder.

MUC5AC was increased in patients with COPD versus healthy controls on days 3, 9 and 12 post-infection (Fig.2b) . There was no significant change in MUC5B from baseline at any time point in patients with COPD or healthy controls and no difference in MUC5B was observed between these two groups during infection (Supplementary Fig.1b) . MUC5AC peak concentrations were increased in patients with COPD compared to baseline with no significant change observed in healthy individuals and peak MUC5AC concentrations were higher in COPD compared to healthy subjects (Fig.2c) . MUC5B peak concentrations were increased in both groups of volunteers when compared to baseline with no significant difference observed between the two groups ( Supplementary Fig.1c ).

RV-induced MUC5AC is related to COPD exacerbation severity

Having characterised the expression of mucins during exacerbation, and noting that MUC5AC induction occurs at day 3, a time-point that precedes peak airway inflammation, which occurs between days 9 and 15 post-infection 1,15 , we next sought to assess relationships between MUC5AC responses and inflammatory responses to infection in our human experimental challenge model. We observed highly significant positive correlations between sputum MUC5AC and cellular airway inflammation (total cell counts and neutrophil counts, Fig.2d ) and between MUC5AC and concentrations of soluble mediators of inflammation including CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL10/IP-10, IL-1b, GM-CSF IL-6 and TNF (Fig.2d) .Since virus replication acts as a driver for airway inflammation 1,15 , we also examined relationships between sputum mucins and virus load and found a positive correlation between sputum MUC5AC and sputum virus load (Fig.2e) .We have previously reported that rhinovirus infection induces secondary bacterial infection in COPD through neutrophil elastase cleaving the anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) and elafin to promote bacterial growth 16 . We found that sputum MUC5AC correlated positively with sputum neutrophil elastase concentrations during infection (Fig.2f) and negatively with the change from baseline in sputum SLPI and elafin concentrations during infection (Fig.2g) , consistent with greater MUC5AC levels during infection being associated with greater induction of neutrophil elastase, and consequent increased degradation of these AMPs. COPD patients with positive bacterial cultures during RV infection also had higher concentrations of sputum MUC5AC during infection and sputum MUC5AC concentrations correlated with bacterial loads determined by 16S qPCR (Fig.2h) . To confirm these latter findings observed in the rhinovirus challenge model, we performed similar analyses in the naturally occurring COPD exacerbation study author/funder. All rights reserved.

Although not induced during infection at any time point assessed, similar analyses were carried out for MUC5B. However, in contrast to MUC5AC, MUC5B did not significantly correlate with any inflammatory marker except GM-CSF (Supplementary Fig.1d) . Similarly, there were no significant correlations of MUC5B with virus load (Supplementary Fig.1e) , and changes from baseline in antimicrobial peptide concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 1f) or bacterial loads during experimental (Supplementary Fig.1g ) or naturally-occurring ( Supplementary Fig.2b ) COPD exacerbation.Pro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular airway inflammation are believed to contribute to duration and severity of RV-induced asthma exacerbations 17,18 and secondary bacterial infection is also associated with greater exacerbation severity in RV-induced COPD exacerbations 16 . Having observed associations between concentrations of MUC5AC and airway inflammation, virus load and secondary bacterial infections, we next determined whether airway mucins during exacerbations were related to clinical outcomes during exacerbation. We observed that sputum MUC5AC concentrations correlated with both upper and lower respiratory tract symptom scores ( Fig.2i ) with no significant correlations observed for MUC5B (Supplementary Fig.1h ). Since chronic mucus hypersecretion is associated with long term FEV 1 decline 19 , we also hypothesized that the amplified induction of MUC5AC during RV infection would be related to acute lung function changes during COPD exacerbation. In experimental RV-induced COPD exacerbations, sputum MUC5AC concentrations correlated negatively with the maximal fall from baseline in peak expiratory flow during exacerbation ( Fig. 2j ) with no such correlation observed for MUC5B ( Supplementary Fig.1i ).To confirm these findings, we additionally measured MUC5AC in an alternative sample type, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), as subjects in the experimental infection study also underwent bronchoscopy at baseline and day 7 after RV infection. BAL MUC5AC protein was similarly increased in COPD subjects versus healthy non-smokers with no difference observed for MUC5B (Supplementary Fig 3) .Combined, these observations confirmed that MUC5AC is the major induced mucin during human virus-induced COPD exacerbations and that concentrations of MUC5AC correlate with inflammation, virus load, secondary bacterial infections and clinical measures of exacerbation severity. author/funder.

Muc5ac-/-mice have attenuated inflammatory responses to RV infection

We next sought to further understand the functional importance of MUC5AC during RV infection using mouse models in which cause and effect relationships can readily be assessed. Mice with gene-targeted deletion of Muc5ac (Muc5ac-/-) (Fig.3a) had attenuated cellular airway inflammation (BAL total cell counts and neutrophil numbers; Fig.3b ) and reduced concentrations of the neutrophil chemokines CXCL1/KC and CXCL2/MIP-2 ( Fig.   3c ) following RV infection compared to wild-type controls. BAL concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF were also reduced in RV-infected Muc5ac-/mice compared to wild-type controls (Fig. 3d) . The pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5ACwere not mediated via interference with antiviral immune responses or virus control as Muc5ac-/-mice and wild type controls had similar levels of IFN-α and IFN-l2/3 protein in BAL and no difference in lung virus loads ( Supplementary Fig 4a-d) .These data indicated that MUC5AC is functionally related to airway inflammatory responses during RV infection.

Exogenous MUC5AC protein augments RV-induced airway inflammation and increases bacterial loads in mice

To further confirm a functional role for MUC5AC in RV-induced inflammation and exacerbation severity, we evaluated the in vivo effects of exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein in the mouse model of RV infection (Fig.4a) . Exogenous MUC5AC administration alone had no effect on BAL inflammatory cell numbers (Fig.4b) or pro-inflammatory chemokine or cytokine concentrations ( Fig.4c&d ) but MUC5AC administration (0.5mg/mL) enhanced RVinduced airway inflammation including increased total cell and neutrophil numbers (Fig. 4b) ,and increased BAL concentrations of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2 and CCL5/RANTES and cytokines IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF (Fig.4c&d) .Conversely, administration of MUC5B protein or a control polymer solution of agarose/dextran at the same concentration (0.5mg/mL) had no effect on inflammation, either alone or when administered in combination with RV infection in mice. (Supplementary Fig   5) Consistent with our hypothesis that MUC5AC drives neutrophil elastase-mediated cleavage of AMPs and subsequently increases bacterial loads, we also observed that exogenous MUC5AC increased RV-induction of neutrophil elastase (Fig.4e) , suppressed RV-induction of SLPI and augmented lung bacterial loads during virus infection (Fig.4f) .

MUC5AC exerts pro-inflammatory effects via extracellular ATP

We next sought to understand how MUC5AC amplifies inflammation during RV infection.Given our prior observations that Muc5ac deletion was anti-inflammatory, while augmentation with exogenous MUC5AC protein in mice had broad pro-inflammatory effects, we reasoned that this mucin could be mediating its effects via a danger signal that promotes inflammatory mediator release and cell recruitment. A previous study demonstrated that supernatants of mucopurulent material from subjects with cystic fibrosis can induce epithelial release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 20 , a well-recognised promoter of inflammation 21 that is also virus-inducible 22 . We therefore hypothesised that MUC5AC exerts its pro-inflammatory effects during RV infection via induction of extracellular ATP and examined the effect of ATP neutralisation using the ATP-hydrolysing enzyme apyrase in exogenous MUC5AC-treated RV-infected mice (Fig 5a) . Exogenous MUC5AC protein administration augmented BAL concentrations of ATP in RV-infected mice, an effect that was abrogated by instillation of apyrase (Fig 5b) . Apyrase administration also suppressed exogenous MUC5AC-mediated increases in airway inflammation during RV infection including BAL total cells and neutrophils (Fig. 5c) , inflammatory chemokines CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2 and CCL5/RANTES (Fig. 5d) and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1b (Fig. 5e) . Apyrase also prevented the exogenous MUC5AC-mediated increase in neutrophil elastase, reversed the MUC5AC-mediated suppression of SLPI and suppressed MUC5ACmediated increased bacterial loads in RV-infected mice (Fig 5f-g) . Apyrase-mediated reversal of pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC did not occur via interference with antiviral immune responses or virus control, as we also observed no effect of apyrase on RVinduction of IFN-α, IFN-l2/3 (Supplementary Fig.6a -c) or lung virus loads ( Supplementary   Fig.6d) .These data confirmed that MUC5AC exerts its pro-inflammatory effects during RV infection through MUC5AC-mediated induction of release of extracellular ATP.

Rhinoviruses induce MUC5AC expression through EGFR signalling 23 . We therefore assessed the effect of EGFR inhibition in a mouse model of elastase-induced emphysema combined with RV-infection in which many features of human COPD exacerbation including mucus hypersecretion are recapitulated 24 .Administration of the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 prior to RV infection in elastase treated mice ( Fig.6a) suppressed RV-induction of lung Muc5ac mRNA, BAL MUC5AC protein (Fig.6b) and suppressed airway epithelial cell mucus staining in lung sections (Fig. 6c , control groups are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7) . AG1478 had no effect on BAL MUC5B protein concentrations (Supplementary Fig.8a&b ). AG1478 administration in elastase-treated mice also suppressed RV-induction of BAL cellular airway inflammation (Fig.6d) , as well as chemokines CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2 and CCL5/RANTES (Fig.6e) , pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, TNF and GM-CSF ( Fig.6f ) and neutrophil elastase (Fig.6g ). AG1478 treatment in elastase-treated RV-infected mice also enhanced BAL SLPI levels and reduced pulmonary bacterial loads (Fig.6h ).

DISCUSSION

The mechanisms underlying virus-induced exacerbations in COPD and the factors that drive inflammation and clinical severity during these episodes are poorly understood. Here, we provide insight into the role that the major airway mucin glycoprotein MUC5AC plays in the biology of these episodes. Using a combination of human and mouse models of rhinovirus infection in COPD, we demonstrate a novel central role of virus-induced MUC5AC in driving COPD exacerbation severity through amplification of airway inflammation, findings that open up new opportunities for targeting MUC5AC therapeutically. We indicate a mechanism for MUC5AC augmentation of RV-induced inflammation via release of extracellular ATP.We show here, that MUC5AC is selectively induced during virus-induced COPD exacerbations and increased compared to virus-infected healthy subjects. By contrast, MUC5B was not induced above baseline and did not differ between COPD and control subjects at any timepoint, indicating that MUC5AC is the major induced mucin during exacerbations. We also found positive correlations between MUC5AC and a range of inflammatory markers. Since airway inflammation is enhanced in COPD exacerbations and believed to contribute to duration and severity of RV induced illnesses 17, 18 we also determined the relationship between MUC5AC and exacerbation severity, finding positive correlations with virus loads, symptom scores and acute lung function decline. MUC5AC is one of the major glycoprotein components of airway mucus and it is therefore unsurprising that its expression during virus infection correlates with lower respiratory symptom scores which comprise an assessment of sputum production. The correlation of MUC5AC with PEF decline can be explained by the fact that greater mucus production is likely to contribute directly to airway obstruction during exacerbation. Our findings in this acute human infection model are in keeping with clinical studies that have reported the association of symptomdefined chronic mucus hypersecretion phenotype with airflow limitation and FEV 1 decline 19, 25 and an animal study showing that genetic deletion of Muc5ac reduces mucus occlusion and improves lung function in models of allergic airway inflammation 11 .We have previously reported that experimental RV infection in patients with COPD is associated with increased frequency of secondary bacterial infection compared to healthy subjects 16,26 via a mechanism of virus-induced neutrophil elastase-mediated cleavage of the anti-microbial peptides SLPI and elafin. The positive correlation of sputum MUC5AC with neutrophil numbers, neutrophil elastase concentrations and secondary bacterial infection and negative correlation with SLPI and elafin levels observed in the current study suggests that increased MUC5AC could be one mechanism contributing to enhanced neutrophilic author/funder.

MUC5AC in inhibiting anti-bacterial responses during virus infection. A previous study by

Ehre et al evaluated responses to influenza infection in a transgenic Muc5ac overexpressing mouse strain and showed reduced viral titres and attenuated neutrophilic inflammation in this model 9 . This contrasts our findings using exogenous MUC5AC administration where there was no effect on virus loads and MUC5AC enhanced virus-induced inflammation. The transgenic strain employed by Ehre et al was associated with ~18-fold increase in airway MUC5AC levels 9 . This level of augmentation greatly exceeds the increases observed in our human analyses where a ~2-fold increase was observed in stable state levels of MUC5AC in COPD versus healthy subjects and ~2-to 3-fold increase was observed from baseline to exacerbation. The concentrations of exogenous MUC5AC protein administered in our animal experiments (0.25-0.5mg/mL) were ~ 1.5-3.5 fold higher than the baseline MUC5AC protein concentrations we measured in the mouse airway (~150µg/mL) and are therefore more likely to be physiologically relevant to human exacerbation. Further, the effect of MUC5AC in reducing virus loads at the much higher MUC5AC levels generated in the MUC5AC transgenic strain reported by Ehre et al may be virus-specific 9 . The authors reported that MUC5AC binds to the influenza virus receptor, α2,3-linked sialic acids in transgenic animals, consistent with a mechanism of influenza protection in vivo through impairment of efficient binding of virus to receptors on the bronchial epithelium leading to reduction in virus loads and consequently lesser inflammation. It is important to note that we used a non-human purified mucin protein in solution for our experiments which does not fully recapitulate the complex biophysical properties of mucin glycoprotein contained within endogenous airway mucus. We confirmed that the mucin preparation used was free of endotoxin and DNA but we cannot exclude that other mucin-bound proteins are present in the solution that may be contributing to the observed effects. Future validation of our findings using administration of human or mouse MUC5AC in similar mouse models is warranted, although extraction and purification of mucins from these sources is technically challenging and was not feasible for the current studies.We identified a mechanism for amplification of rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation by MUC5AC through release of ATP, a danger signal that is released during infection and contributes to nucleotide receptor-dependent inflammatory responses 32 . This mechanism was suggested in a previous study that indicated that administration of sterile supernatants of mucopurulent material from subjects with cystic fibrosis can induce ATP release by human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro 20 . The role of ATP as a potential driver of airway inflammation in stable asthma and COPD is well recognised 33,34 .

We therefore speculate that mucin-induced airway inflammation might trigger further production of MUC5AC leading to a vicious cycle which contributes to enhanced airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion to drive exacerbation severity in COPD. We thus hypothesised that early targeting of MUC5AC during rhinovirus infection might beneficially interrupt this cycle and evaluated the effect of upstream inhibition of rhinovirus-induction of MUC5AC using the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 in a COPD exacerbation mouse model. AG1478 suppressed rhinovirus-induced MUC5AC levels, accompanied by reduced airway inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, neutrophil elastase and AHR, as well as enhanced SLPI production and reduced bacterial loads in rhinovirus-infected elastase-treated mice. Importantly, AG1478 had no impact on anti-viral responses, or virus control, reassuringly indicating that therapies aimed at inhibiting MUC5AC production would not be expected to adversely affect anti-viral host-defence. Jing et al recently reported in COPD airway epithelial cell cultures that administration of an EGFR inhibitor had no effect on RV-induction of MUC5AC and concluded that EGFR does not play a role in promoting virus-induced mucin expression in COPD 36 . However, in this study, the authors examined mucin expression solely at a late timepoint (15 days) post RV infection and did not evaluate effects of the treatment on mucin expression at earlier timepoints nor subsequent effects on production of inflammatory mediators. The data from our human challenge model indicates that peak RV induction of MUC5AC occurs at a much earlier timepoint (3 days) and previous studies have shown that EGFR inhibition can attenuate the early induction of MUC5AC in RV-stimulated airway epithelial cell cultures 23, 37 Our data in a mouse model of COPD-like disease supports the assertion that the early production of MUC5AC in response to RV infection occurs through EGFR and is thus amenable to therapeutic inhibition. A previous study using an inhaled EGFR inhibitor in stable COPD reported more effective EGFR inhibition was related to greater decreases in epithelial mucin stores at higher doses, but this drug was poorly tolerated 38 . Systemic EGFR antagonists are now commonly used in lung adenocarcinoma therapy 39 . Our data in mice now provides justification for human studies to evaluate the role of repurposing these agents for use in COPD exacerbations to inhibit MUC5AC production which could theoretically suppress airway inflammation, reduce secondary bacterial infection and diminish exacerbation severity.author/funder.

Sputum plugs from severe asthmatics have previously been shown to contain more MUC5AC than MUC5B 40 and this constituent likely contains more surface goblet cell derived mucin which may contribute to the differences observed between induction of these two mucins in our studies. However, we also observed increased RVinduced MUC5AC but not MUC5B in an alternative sample type (BAL) from COPD subjects versus healthy subjects, supporting our findings in sputum. There is also evidence to suggest that proteases within sputum samples can interfere with immunodetection of mucins 14 . Some studies have attempted to address this by using treatment with protease inhibitors shortly after sputum collection 6, 41 . We have previously reported, using samples from the same study, that neutrophil elastase is increased in COPD subjects compared to healthy subjects following virus challenge 16 . Given that we observed greater induction of MUC5AC protein in COPD subjects compared to healthy subjects, despite increased levels of proteases, this suggests that the actual difference between these two groups could be even more substantial than observed in our study. Additionally, our finding that sputum MUC5AC but not MUC5B mRNA expression was increased during naturally-occurring exacerbation (mirroring what was observed at the protein level) provides an additional confirmatory approach that would not be subject to these potential confounders. Other studies have used alternative semi-quantitative antibody-independent techniques 7,14,42 but it is unclear whether these approaches would have sufficient sensitivity to detect subtle changes in mucin expression during infection. The primary aim of the human component of our study was to study how mucin levels change during virus-induced exacerbations and our study was unique in that we had sequential sampling from individual patients during exacerbation with consistent methods used to measure mucins in all subjects.In conclusion, we show that MUC5AC is the major induced mucin during virus infection in COPD and that virus-induced MUC5AC plays a central role in driving airway inflammation and exacerbation severity in COPD. Future development or repurposing of therapies that specifically target this component of mucus could lead to improved clinical outcomes. author/funder. All rights reserved.

"Abstract

Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten wildlife populations. Most studies focus 27 on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting 28 long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We 29 used individual-based modelling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and 30 transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian 31 devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed Approximate Bayesian 32 Computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and 33 demographic system properties derived from ten years of data after disease emergence, 34 enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population 35 declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics. Only 21% of 36 matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 years following devil facial tumour 37 disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the 38 remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 years, usually with 39 long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen 40 coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial 41 management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-42 term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that 43 immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of 44Tasmanian devil populations. This is because strong population declines of devils after 45 disease emergence do not necessarily translate into long-term population declines at 46 equilibria. Our modelling approach is widely applicable to other host-pathogen systems to 47 predict disease impact beyond transient dynamics.

"Abstract

We plotted daily data on the frequencies of keywords related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from WeChat, a Chinese social media. Using ""Feidian"", Chinese abbreviation for SARS, may detect the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2019 two weeks earlier. WeChat offered a new approach to early detect disease outbreaks.

","Introduction

An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province of China, occurred in December 2019 [1] . Shortly, the cause was identified as a novel coronavirus [2] , which resembles severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) and now is named SARS-Cov-2 [3, 4] . As of February 23, 2020, 78,811 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,462 deaths have been reported globally and the vast majority of the cases and deaths has happened in China [5] . With a series of measures such as knockdown of 13 cities in Hubei province and stringent travel restrictions throughout the nation, the disease spread is slowing down. However, China still reports quite a few new cases and new deaths every day and the epidemic may rebound as people return to workplace after extended Spring Festival holiday. Meanwhile, the number of infected patients is increasing in other countries (especially in South Korea, Japan, and Italy) [5] .Better early warning and response systems should be established to avoid such disasters.Traditional surveillance systems, including those used by Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), typically rely on clinical, virological, and microbiological data submitted by physicians and laboratories. Due to time and resource constraints, a lack of operational knowledge of reporting systems, and regulations in these systems, substantial lags between an outbreak event and its report are common [6] . On average, the reporting delay is around two weeks for traditional surveillance systems [6, 7] .With the popularization of Internet and smartphones, an increasing number of people use social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, to share information. An event may have been posted in social media for several days or even months before its report through health institutions and .

Internet-based search engines are an important source for health information for people from all walks of life. Analyzing data on search behaviors in turn provides a new approach for detection and monitoring of diseases and symptoms. Technologies using social media, search queries and other Internet resources offer novel and economic approaches for detecting and tracking emerging diseases and have been successfully used in the cases of SARS [8] , influenza [9] , dengue [10] , etc. Herein, we describe the use of such an approach with WeChat, a Chinese social media, to early detect the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak in China, 2019. Internet search queries from Hubei province were also explored.

Methods

WeChat (called Weixin in China), provided by Tencent Inc., is the largest social media in China with over 1 billion monthly active users. WeChat Index, accessed in WeChat app, is a publicly available data service that shows how frequent a specific keyword has appeared in posts, subscriptions, and search on WeChat over a period of last 90 days. Using WeChat Index, we obtained daily data from Nov 17, 2019 to Feb 14, 2020 for the keywords related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease such as ""SARS"", ""Feidian (Chinese abbreviation for severe acute respiratory syndrome)"", ""pneumonia"", ""fever"", ""cough"", ""shortness of breath"", ""dyspnea"", ""fatigue"", ""stuffy nose"", ""runny nose"", ""diarrhea"", ""coronavirus"", ""novel coronavirus"", and ""infection"" (see the raw data in Appendix A). All the keywords except ""SARS"" were used in Chinese.Baidu is the dominant Chinese Internet search engine. Baidu Index (https://index.baidu.com), provided by Baidu Inc., can show how frequent a keyword has been queried over a time period from a region. The keywords related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease as mentioned above were also .

As the outbreak is an isolated rather than recurrent event and the cut-off value to detect an outbreak based on social media and online search behavior is unknown, statistical analysis were not performed. The outbreak was announced by Wuhan Health Commission (WHC) on Dec 31, 2019 (D-day) andChina CDC involved in investigation and response this day [11] . If WeChat Index for a keyword spiked or increased before D-day, the index for the keyword was considered as a potential candidate for the outbreak sign [12] .

Results

During the period from Nov 17, 2019 to Dec 30, 2019 (44 days), WeChat Index spiked or increased for the keywords Feidian, SARS, coronavirus, novel coronavirus, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and diarrhea (Table 1) .WeChat Index for Feidian stayed at a low level with small variance before Dec 15, 2019, on which it increased significantly. Then, the index persisted at relative high levels from the next day to Dec 29, 2019 and rose rapidly just on the day before D-day, up to a peak on D-day ( .

Discussion

By exploring daily data from WeChat, a Chinese social media, we found that the frequencies of several keywords related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease behaved abnormally during a period ahead of the outbreak in China, 2019. Of these keywords, Feidian is especially worthy of attention. In 2003, the SARS outbreak caused mass panic among people in China and approximately half of the victims were health care workers [13] . Since then, Chinese physicians are alert to SARS and similar diseases [14] . If the manifestations and chest images indicate viral pneumonia and similar cases occurs in a region during a short time, they naturally think of SARS that is called Feidian in Chinese language. When suspected cases admitted to hospitals, involved physicians may mention Feidian and communicate in WeChat using this word. As showed in the current study, the activity of Feidian in WeChat began to rise on Dec 15, 2019. According to publications of early cases with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection, five to eleven patients had symptom onset by this day, with the first onset on Dec 1, 2019 [1, 11] . Furthermore, the activity of Feidian persisted at levels higher than those ahead of Dec 15, 2019 and it dramatically rose to a peak on the day of the outbreak announcement. Altogether, WeChat Index for Feidian is a strong warning sign for the .

Using it may early detect the outbreak ahead of two weeks compared with the traditional surveillance systems in China.The activity of SARS in WeChat was abnormally high in Dec 1 to 3, 2019 compared to the days ahead and after. Data by now shows that the symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. Whether there was an inner link between the word activity in WeChat and early patients is unknown. The activity of novel coronavirus in WeChat was abnormally high on Dec 11, 2019 with an Index value of 400. However, its baseline value of WeChat Index (value equals 0 or 50) was very low compared with those of other keywords (Appendix A). It is unclear whether the abnormality was a signal or a noise. As for keywords related to symptoms such as shortness of breath, dyspnea, and diarrhea, WeChat Index increased in value ahead of 9-13 days of the outbreak announcement. These symptoms are not specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. The increases may have some association with emergence of the disease, or just a coincidence. Though lack inner link and not performed that well in detecting the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak compared with keyword Feidian, other keywords explored in the study, including those not considered as potential candidates for the outbreak sign, and even keywords not explored in the study (such as the names of drugs treating SARS-CoV-2 infection), may still have value in future outbreak detection and monitoring. Experience from Google Flu Trends showed that a combination of potential keywords other than a single keyword is more successful [9] .Gathering and analyzing data from social media, Internet search queries, news wires and web sites represents a novel approach to early warning and detection of disease outbreaks and is a supplementary to traditional surveillance systems [6] .

As far as we know, GPHIN and other established tools do not gather data from WeChat, the dominant Chinese social media. The current study shows that gathering and analyzing data from WeChat may be amazing to early detect disease outbreak. This may have an advantage especially for detecting outbreaks in China considering the population of WeChat users. Previous studies used search query data, including Baidu Index, to monitor the activity of emerging infectious diseases [15] [16] [17] . As far as we know, this is the first time to use WeChat data in this field. As the current study indicated, using WeChat data may perform better than using Baidu search query data in early detecting the outbreak of a new disease because people may communicate first in WeChat in the times of WeChat as a lifestyle of ChineseThe main limitation of the study lies on its retrospective nature. The outbreak is a solitary case.Using WeChat data to early detect outbreaks like this should be valued in the future. In addition, history data of WeChat Index 90 days ago is unavailable and how the index is calculated is not open.In summary, using data of WeChat, a Chinese social media, may early detect the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China in 2019. If WeChat Index for the keyword Feidian were monitored, the outbreak would be detected 2 weeks earlier. Future studies can prospectively gather and analyze data from WeChat to early detect SARS-CoV-2-like outbreaks as well as outbreaks of other diseases in China.

"Abstract

I estimate plausible true positive (TP) rates for the number of COVID-19 tests per day, most relevant when the number of test is on the same order of magnitude as number of infected persons. I then modify a standard SEIR model to model current growth patterns and detection rates in South Korea and New York state. Although reducing transmission rates have the largest impact, increasing TP rates by ~10% in New York can have an impact equal to adding tens of thousands of new tests per day. Increasing both TP rates and tests per day together can have significant impacts and likely be more easily sustained than social distancing restrictions.

","Introduction

As the COVID-19 virus spreads there are wide calls for increased testing to identify cases and slow the spread. Colburn (2020) has pointed out that we need to model the effects of testing, contact tracking, isolation, and related interventions in order to better use resources. Currently, (March 28 th , 2020), South Korea seems to have successfully contained the spread using a variety of strategies, including wide-spread testing and tracking. However, unless the number of tests approaches the size of the population, or the size of all possibly infected persons, there will be some criteria for choosing whom to test. Choosing whom to test is a decision problem for which predicting who is pre-symptomatic would be most beneficial. How beneficial depends on the true positive rate (i.e. ratio of true positives to sum of true positives and false negatives). But the difficulty in modeling the true positive (TP) rate of testing and related strategies is that the number of false negatives (misses) are unknown.Here, using preliminary online data reports, I derive rough approximations of TP rates from numbers of tests relative to a population to produce a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, which, to my knowledge, has not been presented yet even in such a rough form. I then modify a standard SEIR model (R, Epidynamics package) to use TP rate to decrease the pool of infected individuals. Using model parameters published elsewhere, a grid search of TP rates and beta (time to contact) values shows that, in regions of parameter space that match empirical data, increasing TP rate can have critical impacts in slowing spread of the virus. TP rate can increase with large increases in testing or by improving the prediction on whom to test for. In fact, public health agencies should be gathering data for such endeavor which could be done independently of any need for material resources of testing kits.

Estimating TP Rate

It is not known how effective limited COVID-19 testing can be for slowing the spread of the virus, but there is some preliminary cases that can help give rough estimates of TP and FP rates from the number of testing per day. For example, South Korea health board reported to have been testing up to about 13000-15000 individuals per day, from when the maximum increase in cases was near 1000 per day at the end of February up to the end of March (South Korean Public Health Board). The new cases rate has dropped to about 100 per day (March 28 th ). The ratio of 15-to-1 ratio of tests-per-new-cases at the peak is much higher than in US states like New York and California currently, and these and others states are trying to rapidly increase these number (COVID Tracking Project). Studies suggest that COVID-19 can incubate for an average of 6.4 days (e.g. Prem et al., 2020) . In the standard SEIR epidemiological model new infected individuals (I) come from the exposed incubating group (E). Therefore, if one assumes that the COVID-19 test is near 100 percent accurate for candidates from both groups, and that results are produced in 1 day, then at the peak of new cases in South Korea there were about 6000 cases in group E and the TP rate was ~ 0.16. Of course, this is an approximation that does not take into account many other factors, such as travelers, individuals who have symptoms but do not have COVID-19, retesting, or the accuracy of the test itself, as opposed the accuracy of selecting whom to test.Another example to consider is the Diamond Princess cruise ship case. According to the CDC all individuals were tested over several weeks, some multiple times (Moriarty, et al., 2020) . There were ~10% of individuals on board who tested positive and showed symptoms, ~10% who tested positive and showed no symptoms at the time of testing, and 80% negative. This suggests that if you have a number of tests on the order of the number of infected individuals you would only get about 50% TP rate. If you had more tests and only considered symptoms as a predictor, then after the first 10% of the population (with symptoms), the TP rate would increase at the baseline rate of 1 out 9 tests. Contact tracking could help, but in some sense the whole ship was in the sphere of possible contact.Using these two examples one could produce a plausible ROC curve of sensitivity (TP rate) vs specificity (FP rate), Figure 1 . In this case, the values on the axis are percentages from 0 to 1. Importantly, the graph is not easily parameterized by the absolute number of tests but should be thought of as parameterized by relative values as follows. If we think of the cruise ship example, we imagine that all the passengers & crew are given a score that predicts their likelihood of having COVID-19, and then tested in sequence of rank 1 to rank P, the population size, according to the score. As we test from 1/P to P/P fraction then the TP rate and FP rate . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050393 doi: medRxiv preprint will go from 0 to 1 as function of time. In other words, as we test more and more of a population, the TP rate will increase as shown.

Figure 1.

An estimated ROC curve of TP rate and FP rate, with an inflection point given by a parameter called TP-infpt, i.e. the TP rate when the number of tests per day is maximal but still somewhat lower than number of persons thought to be possibly infected. The region between the dashed lines are suggested plausible regions of rate values based on reported data. In simulations for South Korea and New York state the initial TP rate at the origin is 0.01 (1%) and rises quickly. The time before it rises and hits the inflection point depends on number of days and speed with which health agencies ramped up their testing capacity.Conversely, we can also imagine the curve is parameterized as a function of the score threshold. As we get more and more tests our threshold for who gets tested will decrease, and TP rate will increase. Of course, the false positive rate (i.e. individuals who are predicted to be positive but are negative) will increase as well but that cost is much less than misses (false negatives). A third way to consider the parameterization is a function of number of infected individuals (I), which is perhaps most relevant for current situation. If our testing is on the order of magnitude as I, and if we think we need to have 15* I tests, then the units could be considered multiples of I. In either case, the shape of the graph is the same but the increase in the efficacy of testing will depend on whether we can increase the number of tests, or decrease the pool of potentially infected persons, or just test for more days. If we could also improve the score thresholding, then that could increase the whole shape of the graph and change the inflection point.In the next sections the SEIR model is adapted to incorporate TP rates, and using parameters published elsewhere, the model is applied to South Korea and New York state. A vital question is how much impact an increase in testing will have in New York. We run the model to show tradeoffs and potential benefits of more testing, better predictions, and possible growth curves..

Modifying the SEIR Model

The SEIR infectious disease spread model was implemented in the R package EpiDynamics (Baquero & Marques, 2015) , using methods from Keeling & Matt (2008) . I modified the model so that the change in number of persons infected, dI/dt, is decreased by [-1 * TP rate * I] and the recovered pool (R) is increased by the same amount, which implies detected cases are immediately removed from the susceptible pool (S). The TP rate was given by the curve in Figure 1 with 4 parameters; TP-infpt, is the TP rate inflection point, t1='time-to-start' is the time during which few tests were done as the epidemic started, t2='time-to-ramp-up' is the time at which maximum daily tests were given, and P for population size. For example, South Korea did not start with 15000 tests but took some days to get organized and ramp up. Based upon reports, tests increased rapidly and steadily after February 10 th up to March 28th (South Korea CDC). Use a starting time around mid-January, I set t1=20, t2=68. The other parameters are set as described in Table 1 . Note that beta was varied to model and test different effects of TP rates, and mu was set to 0 to ignore birth/death rates. I ran the model for TP-infpt = 0.1 to 0.5, beta= 0.22 to 0.42 (R0~beta*7, or R0~1.5 to 3.0, where 1/7 is recovery rate, and beta is the contact rate). The contour plot in Figure 2 shows the maximum values reached in simulations (up to t = 120). The goal of the simulations is not to precisely match reported number of infected persons, which likely do not reflect true values, but to match the general time of peaking in the growth curve to within an order of magnitude. The growth plot in Figure 2 shows an example where the TP-infpt and beta parameters match the empirical growth curve for South Korea (e.g. www.worldodemeters.info). For South Korea, the peak value of infected cases was about 7300, and peak days were about 45-60 days (early to mid-March). The effective TP rate can have a big impact on whether growth is suppressed or increases because it essentially counteracts R0, the reproduction number (i.e. transmission rate). However, when R0 is very high (i.e. beta > 0.40) the impact of TP rate is relatively smaller, which is why Figure 2 has non-linear contour lines in that region. Even so, as the example growth plot shows, the TP rate can make a big difference over time. I also ran the model to compare to New York state. Based on reported testing numbers (COVID Table 2 . Simulation parameters for New York state simulation. Notice the testing phase time points are higher but steeper than South Korea.The contour plot in Figure 3 shows maximum values reached during the simulation, and a sample growth curve with a peak value of 188K infected persons, and a value on day 58 near the currently reported number (~50K). The true number is likely higher, but it gives a starting point to consider tradeoffs in parameters. The parameters for the sample growth curve were beta =0.42 (same as Figure 2 ) and TP-infpt 0.15. It is reasonable that TP-infpt is lower for New York than South Korea based on reports that South Korea has been more aggressive in testing and tracking contacts. Using the model values at day 58 as initial values, I ran the model again from that time point but with slight variations. It turns out that increasing TP-infpt rate by 10%, from 0.15 to 0.165 after day 58 has the same effect as increasing the number of tests by 50% to 37500 tests per day after day 58. The effect in both cases is to cut the number of cases at the peak by about 25% from 188K about day 120 to about 140K on or about day 108. These values should not be taken as predictions about absolute infected counts that might occur, but rather they suggest the relative importance of improving the efficacy of testing and increasing the number of tests. Figure 4 extends the simulation for a range of new parameter values that take effect after day 58. In the contour plot, starting from the lower left corner with TP-infpt rate of 0.15 and test per day at 25K, increasing TP rates have a bigger impact on decreasing the peak value of infected person. In the sample growth curve plot, change both TP-infpt rate and number of tests per day by 50% will dramatically change the growth curve. The contour plot shows maximum number of infected persons as TP-infpt rate and tests per day are increased. The increases are relative to the values using in the growth plot in Figure 3 which is similar to data observed in New York. The sample growth plot suggests that increasing TP rates and tests by a factor of 1.5 will start flattening the growth curve immediately.

Discussion

I presented a rough estimate of a ROC curve to simulate how increasing the number of tests slow the spread of COVID-19. An important point that is easily overlooked is that knowing the TP rate relative the number infection cases is likely more useful than knowing the absolute number of tests or number of tests per capita, as is often reported in the news media. In fact, the relation between the number of tests and proportion of detected cases out of all positive cases is indicated by the TP rate. In the current crises, this is unknown. Nonetheless, with plausible values of the TP rate one can model the impact of increasing TP rates. With a modified SEIR model, I have shown that simulations of virus spread can produce valid estimates of currently infected persons and enable estimates of future growth under different scenarios.It has become painfully obvious that the number of COVID-19 cases in New York will still be increasing for some time. A critical strategy is to reduce the reproduction number by reducing contact and movement because the growth factor has an exponential effect. However, at this point in time it may not by itself slow the spread enough unless restrictions become draconian and long lasting. More testing and quarantining will help mitigate the rise, but if testing is going to copy the South Korean numbers, the testing in New York must increase faster than the virus spread, perhaps to get up to 15 to 1 ratio of new cases (as of March 28 th , that would be about ~75000 tests per day). But just as important is to increase efficacy by collecting good data to better score and allocate tests. A good scoring model and allocation strategy, that increases TP rate by a one or two percentage points could have the same impact as increasing the number of tests by tens of thousands. The scoring model perhaps could include contacts and locations, along with demographics, weather, type of places visited, time of day, and anything else that could help build a robust model on top of virus spread models and tracking contacts. In some high profile machine learning competitions, intensive application and modeling efforts have shown improvements of 10 percentage points in accuracy (e.g. Netflix Prize, Wikipedia, Zillow Landing Pages). There should be low technical or material barriers to gathering and using data, and I would argue that health agencies should start doing so and making the anonymized data available. .

"Abstract

The epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now is spreading worldwide. The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan.

","Introduction

In December 2019, a pneumonia case caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was firstly reported in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, China 1 . The serious clinical symptoms of the viral infection including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia, may result in progressive respiratory failure and even death 2 . The disease which quickly spread to the rest of China and other continents, was currently been named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) 3, 4 . Till March 1 st , 2020, at least 79,971 confirmed cases and 2,873 death caused by SARS-CoV-2 were reported by the National Health Commission of China 5 .The epidemiological study of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia provided evidence of human-to-human transmission 6, 7 . Subsequently, the Chinese government quickly responded to this epidemic with a series of public health policies. For example, Wuhan, the largest city in central China with over 9 million permanent residents, was blocked for both outside and internal transportation to contain the spread of the epidemic on Jan 23 rd , 2020 8 . Meanwhile, 31 provinces, cities and autonomous regions launched the level 1 public health response before Jan 30 rd , 2020 9 . Moreover, multiple converted hospitals including Huoshenshan hospital, Leishenshan hospital, and mobile cabin hospital were constructed or renovated to support the battle against the epidemic in Hubei, China 10 .Currently, several epidemic models were established for SARS-CoV-2 and the basic reproductive number R0 was estimated from 2 to 5 [11] [12] [13] [14] . The rapid transmission at the early stages might have been accelerated because of the out-break time is close to the Chinese Lunar New Year. The positive news is, besides Hubei province, the daily increase of new laboratory-confirmed patients in other regions of China has been declining since the peak on Feb 3 rd , 2020, 11 days after the lockdown of Wuhan and 4 days after level 1 public health response in other regions 15 . This further indicated that timely public health policies might significantly prevent the rapid spread of the epidemic.Here, we proposed a status dynamic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Out of the system (with Medical care/maximum beds in Hospital) SEIO (MH) model, to reveal the influence of the national public health response for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics outbreak in Wuhan, China. Different from the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) continuous model 13 . SEIO(MH) model is a real-time discrete model with two more essential parameters: 1) the number of people with medical care (M), and 2) the currently available beds in hospitals. The local status dynamic SEIO (MH) model could simulate the population in each status at any date during the epidemic. Also, this model could simulate multiple national public health responses including: 1) lockdown of the traffic in one city, 2) the hospital bed shortage as well as the amelioration in the medical system when multiple converted hospitals are available, and 3) the temporary public gathering events.According to the simulation results, the first patient (patient zero) was more likely to appear on Nov. 29 th , 2019. From Nov. 29 th , 2019 to Jan. 23 th , 2020, the basic reproduction number ܴ was estimated at 2.65 before the lockdown of Wuhan. Till Jan 22 th , 2020 before lockdown, the cumulative number of infections and exposures was 4,153 and 6,536, respectively. After the lockdown, the value of ܴ decreased to 1.98 for the first 30 days. The peak point was simulated on Feb. 17 th , 2020 with 24,115 infected people and the endpoint would be near June 17 th , 2020. The total number of infected people in Wuhan was predicted to be 77,453. Moreover, we also simulated the infections under the three aforementioned public health responses. The construction of this model could not only study the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic outbreak in Wuhan, but also help design appropriate national public health policies for other countries.

Dataset

The increasing number of infected, cured and dead from Jan 27 th , 2020 to Feb 2 nd , 2020 were derived from the Health Commission of Hubei Province 16 . Migration index before the lockdown and after the lockdown was derived from BAIDU migration 17 . Beds in hospitals were derived from the news and reports from the Wuhan government 18 .

Notation of Parameters

The following variables denote the total number of people in each of the following statuses: 

Model construction and status dynamic modeling of epidemic in Wuhan

The parameters of the status dynamic SEIO (MH) model were fitted according to the daily reports of new infections in Wuhan from Jan 27 th to Feb 2 th , during which the daily new increase of people in status ‫ܫ‬ was monotonously increasing with time. The initial number of people in status ‫ܫ‬ and ‫ܧ‬ were simulated from 500 to 10,000, while parameter ߙ and ߚ were simulated from 10 -9 to 10 -11 , respectively. Also, the median time of people from status ‫ܯ‬ to status ܱ and people from status ‫ܫ‬ to status ܱ were simulated according to the increasing number of cured and dead from Jan 27 th to Feb 2 th . By minimizing the absolute error to the ground truth number in status ‫ܫ‬ , the statuses on Jan 27 th can be inferred.Based on the fitted parameters, the simulation showed that it would take 14 days for people to transfer from status ‫ܯ‬ to status ܱ . For those out of the system before been hospitalized, it would take 28 days to transfer from status ) raised up to 8,509 on Jan 26 th . With the default parameters, the epidemic in Wuhan was described by local status dynamic SEIO (MH) modeling. Illustrated in Figure 2a , patient zero was inferred to appear on Nov. 29 th , 2019. From that day to Jan 23 th , 2020, when less intervention was applied to prevent the epidemic, the number of infected people increased exponentially. After Jan 23 th , the circulation intensity of people in Wuhan decreased sharply after the city lockdown 19 . However, the people infected with symptoms, exposed and in hospitalization were estimated to be 1,682, 6,536 and 2,471 respectively on Jan 22 nd , 2020 and increased to 1,999, 7,676 and 2,877 respectively on Jan 23 rd , 2020 (Figure 2b) , which was a large population with infected people and would lead to the outbreaks of the epidemic in the early period even after the lockdown.Notably, the hospital was full of people (>80% of the current ‫ܪ‬ ) in status ‫ܫ‬ from Jan 22 th , 2020 to Feb 10 th , 2020. After the increasing number of beds in hospitals at Date Jan 25 th , Jan 31 th , Feb 6 th , and Feb 10 th , the hospital was still full immediately, indicating the deficiency of medical resources in Wuhan at the early period ( Figure  2a ). After the large scale of mobile cabin hospitals, the shortage of beds in hospitals was improved. We expected that the peak point in Wuhan would be Feb 17 th , 2020 with 24,115 infected people, including 7,676 exposed, 1,999 infected with symptoms and 2,877 with medical care (Figure 2c) , and the epidemic would end on Jun. 17 th , 2020 with 77,453 infected people eventually, which was basically consistent with Yang's study 14 . The basic reproduction number ܴ was estimated to be 2.65 and would drop to 1.98 after one month since the lockdown. This result suggested that the choice of lockdown date and the number of hospital beds would significantly affect the development of the epidemic. Also, it should be noticed that the time of the epidemic period is overlapped with the Chinese Lunar New Year, in which public gathering events are expected. Thus, 1) the date of lockdown, 2) the number of available hospital beds 3) the public gathering events, were considered in our simulation..

Impact of different public health policies

Impact of the lockdown of Wuhan. Here, we studied the effect of advancing or delaying the lockdown date by 1 to 7 days. Results indicated that, if Wuhan was blocked on Jan 16 th , the accumulated infectious would be 4,063 on Jan 22 th , which was slightly below 4,521 on the same date in current status. However, the exposed people on Jan 22 th were 2,427, only 37% of the simulated number (2,428/6,536) with the current lockdown date. Moreover, the peak time and endpoint . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .would be advanced by 10 days (Figure 3 ). The total number of infected people would be 21,508, 28% (21,508/77,453) of the current situation and even one-day advance would cause only 82% (63,226/77,453) infections at the end point (Table 1) .On the contrary, if the lockdown was delayed by 1 to 7 days, the peak number would be dramatically increased. It could be found that, if the city was blocked 1 to 6 days later than Jan. 23 th , 2020, the total infected people would be 1.23 times (95,273), 1.47 times (114,105), 1.83 times (141,409) , 2.28 times (176,300), 2.90 times (222,384) and 4.94 times (382,695) than Jan. 23 th , 2020 (Supplementary Figure 1 & Table 1 ), which was also consistent with one previous study 14 . When the lockdown was 7 days later than the current choice, the first peak would arrive at Mar. 1 st , 2020 with 97,779 infected people and the second peak would reach 243,693 on Sept. 1 st , 2020. The number of total infected people would exceed 1.9 million and make the epidemic uncontrollable within the year 2020 (Figure 3b) .

Impact of hospital bed numbers.

Our simulation results showed that there was a shortage of hospital beds at the early stage of the epidemic, in which people in status ‫ܫ‬ would not be completely isolated and treated with medical care. In that case, we simulated the effect of hospital bed numbers by multiplying its value by factors from 0.5 to 3 times, for each time point compared with current situations. Results indicated that if the beds in hospitals were halved, the peak time and endpoint would be Feb. 26 th and Jul. 15 th , respectively. Moreover, 34,526 total infectious would be observed in the peak time, 1.43 times than the current situation, and 148,848 people would be infected eventually (Figure 3c ). If the beds in hospitals were 1.5, 2, 2,5 and 3 times compared to the current situation, the total infectious number would be 62,353, 56,031, 53,245 and 51,898, respectively (Supplementary Table 1 ). Typically, tripling the beds in hospitals would end the epidemic 9 days earlier than the current situation ( Figure 3d) . Different from the lockdown of the city, when beds in hospitals were 2 times of current situations at each time point, the effect of increasing beds in hospitals was no longer significant (Supplementary Figure 2) . In fact, when increasing the beds of hospitals by 3 times of the current situation, the total infectious at the endpoint would only decrease by 2.6% (1,347) than the 2.5-fold increase.Impact of public gathering events. Since the time of the epidemic was overlapped with the Chinese Spring Festival and winter holiday, people were gathering together for celebration during the epidemic time. Thus, public gathering events would frequently happen if no prevention policies were imposed. For example, Wuhan conducted the banquet for ten thousand families on Jan 18 th , 2020 20 , 5 days before the city lockdown. Here, we simulated the impact of public gathering events by increasing the transmission parameter α from 5% to 25% in an individual day such as Jan 20 th , 2020.Results showed that, if we increase α by 5% in one single day such as Jan 20 th , the number of infections in peak time and end point will increase by 1,237 (5%) and 4,243(5%), respectively (Figure 3e ). If α is increased by 25%, the number of people in peak time and endpoint will increase by 7,449 (31%) and 24,929 (32%), respectively (Figure 3f ). Other results were also illustrated in Supplementary Figure 3 &  Supplementary Table 2 . Thus, the public gathering events in one single day could .

The delay of city lockdown might easily make the epidemic out of control. Also, the public gathering events were inconducive for the prevention and control of the epidemic, since the slight increase of transmission parameter α would significantly affect the total infectious numbers at the end point. The number of beds in hospitals was essential in the early period of the epidemic when infected people increased rapidly, after the peak point, the beds would be enough for the increasing number of infected people. .

Simulation of no intervention and early time to release the Wuhan

Finally, we simulated the extreme situation that no intervention is performed. The circulation intensity in the same time period last year was derived from BAIDU migration data 17 to generated the α and β without any interventions. By setting the total number in human as 9 million 21 the results showed that the ܴ would reach to 4.4 and over 7,697,484 people would be infected on Jun. 21 st , 2019 (Figure 4a ), which indicated that the epidemic was totally out of control without any intervention.Another issue was about the early release of Wuhan. We experimented with the release time point of 150 days after the occurrence of patient zero, which is Apr. 27 th , 2020 (Figure 4b) . Results showed that, at that time the epidemic seemed to be under control with only 168 infected with symptoms and 2,912 with medical care on Apr. 27 th , 2020 ( Figure 4c ) and kept decreasing until Mar 9 th , 2020, in which the status number of infected with symptoms and 2,912 with medical care was 178 and 2,201 respectively. However, the number of exposed people increased from 863 on Apr. 27 th to 1,085 on Mar 9 th , 2020, with the epidemic rapidly rebounded. After 120 days of releasing the city, on Aug. 25 th , 2020, 11,203 exposed, 2,315 infected with symptoms and 20,516 with medical care were predicted (Figure 4d ). The beds in hospitals would not be enough again on Oct. 2 nd , 2020 with over 256,730 accumulated infections.Although the transmission parameter α and β would not be the same as those before the lockdown, they were both increased by 25% (compared to the values during lockdown) to simulate the early release of the city. The results indicated that it was still a great risk to release the city before the epidemic reached the end point, even though the situation seemed to be under control.

Discussion

The epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has spread to China and multiple continents, which will be developed into a worldwide epidemic. During the epidemic period, nowcasting and forecasting are crucial for public health planning and control domestically and internationally 12, 22 . Here, we constructed a real-time status dynamic SEIO (MH) model to estimate the local outbreaks. By adding the parameters of status M and H, this model could accurately forecast the epidemics when the medical system under unexpected pressure. Moreover, this model could simulate the influence of different public health policies such as 1) lockdown of the city and 2) construction of temporary hospitals, which could help design the appropriate public health policies for epidemic control. At present, besides Wuhan, the epidemic situation in China has been effectively contained within a short period of time. This is largely due to the rapid response of the Chinese governments at various levels and the decision to lock down Wuhan, which is the first time to block a city with over 9 million permanent residents in human history. The lockdown of Wuhan would not only prevent the transportation between Wuhan to other cities, but also decrease the circulation intensity of people within Wuhan. According to BAIDU migration data, the circulation index of Wuhan is 6 to 8 times lower than those before the lockdown. The number of newly confirmed cases increased rapidly after the lockdown may due to the fact that, there have been already 4,521 infected and 6,536 exposed without symptoms before lockdown. It is noted that only 444 confirmed cases were reported by the Health Commission of Hubei Province 16 . However, by facing an epidemic with the new pathogen, it is difficult to invent the diagnosis kit in such a short time. Thus, the diagnosis quantity might affect the early understanding of the epidemics and the lockdown decision at that time was decisive and timely. In fact, even one day delay of the lockdown would make 17,631 more infected people at the end point and a one-week delay would make the epidemic in Wuhan uncontrollable with over 1.9 million infectious.Despite the advantage of epidemic control, the lockdown of Wuhan has significantly increased the pressure of local medical resources, including the rapidly growing demands for hospitalization, lack of medical staff such as doctors and nurses, and shortage of medical supplies. The simulation results illustrated the establishment of new temporary hospitals that could accommodate more patients could significantly help the control of the epidemic. In fact, if the beds in hospitals were three times more than the current situation, the total infectious would decrease by 33% at the end point. After the period of rapidly rising, beds in hospitals were not an essential parameter since the daily increase of infected people was less than the people out of the system. The lock of medical staff and the shortage of medical supplies increased the death rate in Wuhan, which was significantly higher than the rest of China. Based on this situation, multiple provinces sent medical teams and supplies to support Wuhan for epidemic control and treatment, which might help improve the curative ratio. Till Feb.. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . 5 th , 2020, nearly 7,000 medical staff were sent to Wuhan by governments at all levels in China 23 .Another noteworthy point is the public gathering events. Since the epidemic is overlapped with the Chinese Lunar New Year, public gathering events such as banquet of one thousand families in Wuhan could promote the spread of the epidemic. By adding a small turbulence (5%) in transmission parameter α on Jan 20 th , 2020, 4,194 more people would be infected at the end point, which indicated the public gathering events at the early period of the epidemic should be stopped. Thus, the Chinese government prohibited the public gathering events with policies such as close large public places, extend the winter holiday for both staff and students. It is noted that, Japan and Koran also organized public gathering activities such as marathons, sacrifices activities, and rally in early February, 2020, which would be inconducive to the prevention and control of the epidemic.The model forecasted that the peak time in Wuhan has been past and the epidemic in China is now under control. Currently, multiple countries including Koran, Japan, Iran, Italy, and the United States are in the outbreak stage 24 . As the first country facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the experience of China in fighting the epidemics might provide useful guidance for other countries. According to our modeling study, we believe that the most effective public health policies for SARS-CoV-2 epidemic prevention are provided as follows: 1) reduce the local circulation intensity of people, 2) prepare enough medical resources, especially available beds in hospitals, 3) try to prohibit large public gathering events. It is expected that this study might provide useful guidance for other countries in fighting against the epidemic of COVID-19 or other similar infectious diseases.

for automotive warranty data by author to predict the failures numbers at field. When the coronavirus infected cases and death were plugged in this model for Michigan, it is interested to see it fits this model very well since the outbreak of this disease. Then the author continues to update this fitting by using the daily reported data in Michigan, and attempt to predict the next few day's infected cases and death. On 3/28/2020, the author decided to plug all the U.S.A 25 infected cases and death data in this model, it is also surprised that this fits the Crow-AMSAA model as well. Then the author decided to write this paper to describe what is the Crow-AMSAA model and how the analysis has been done by author. The Crow-AMSAA model might be useful to predict the infected cases and death for a future pandemic. n(t) = λt β (1) taking the natural logarithms of equation (1) Ln n(t) = Ln (λ )+ β Ln (t)The model intensity function ρ (t) = λβt β-1The cumulative failure rate is use the equation (1) divided by t. it is C(t) =λt β-1 (4) 5 The intensity function is the derivative of the cumulative events n(t) = λt β , ρ (t) is called the rate of occurrence (ROC). In equation (2), the scale parameter, λ, is the intercept on the y axis of n(t) when t =1, (ln(1) =0); the slope β, is interpreted in a similar manner as a Weibull plot, If the slope β is greater than 1, the failure rate is increasing, the failure rate come more rapidly, if the slope β is smaller than 1, the failure rate is decreasing, the failure rate come more slowly, if the 10 slope β is equal to 1, the process is called homogenous Poisson process, if the slope β is not equal 1, the process is called non-homogenous Poisson process.There are three methods to be used to fit the line, the regression, IEC unbiased, and IEC MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation). The regression solution is not as accurate as the newer IEC unbiased and MLE methods except for very small samples.

Data Analysis:

The daily infected cases and death data in Michigan are reported in the website in the reference [IV] . The daily confirmed data is shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 . The Crow-AMSAA model in SuperSmith package is used to fit the data, the Crow-AMSAA fitting in Log-Log scale is shown in Fig. 2 . From the Fig. 2 , in the first 9 days (3/10/2020 to 3/18/2020), it has the less infected 20 cases, so the infected cases do not follow the Crow-AMSAA line, but after 3/19/2020, when the outbreak starts, the infected data fits the Crow-AMSAA line significantly.(See Fig. 2 , pink line). The death data in MI is also fitting Crow-AMSAA model. (See Fig. 2 , blue line). The interval prediction for both infected and death in Michigan are shown in Fig. 3 based on Crow-AMSAA. The author observed the predicted data versus the real data for past 13 days, although the 25 predicted number has the some deviation from the real number, the Crow-AMSAA is still a useful model for the Coronavirus 19 cases.The same study has been done for both infected cases and death data in U.S.A. The data and results are shown in Table 1 , Fig. 4 , 5, and 6. From Fig. 5 , from 2/15/2020 to 3/1/2020, the infected cases do not follow Crow-AMSAA, from 3/2/2020 to 3/18/2020, the infected cases fit 30 one Crow-AMSAA line, but after 3/19/2020, the infected cases fit another Crow-AMSAA line. The death data fits the Crow-AMSAA line after 3/16/2020.

Conclusion:

From the above analysis for the confirmed cases (infected and death) for Coronavirus 19 in Michigan and U.S.A, the Crow-AMSAA model can be used to fit the infected cases and death in 35 the outbreak period. Although there is a deviation between real and Crow-AMSAA prediction, the Crow-AMSAA is still a good model to fit the data.also thanks the Fulton Findings company to provide the SuperSmith package.All rights reserved.

"Abstract

To compare the sex differences in the clinical findings among patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 .We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and compared differences between men and women.: Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs.0.04ng/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16 (57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037).

","Introduction

From December 2019, a pneumonia with unknown cause emerged in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, Wuhan, Hubei province. On January 3, 2020, the first complete genome of the novel β genus coronaviruses was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from a patient [1] , which is different from the known 6 coronaviruses and named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by WHO [2] . Soon later, the novel virus has proved to share more than 79% of same sequence with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3] . Therefore, the virus is formally designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [4] . The disease caused by the virus is named as coronavirus disease 2019 .In the following months, SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread throughout China and even other countries [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, the knowledge and understanding of the COVID-19 are still limited. Generally, the disease could be classified into four clinical types: mild, moderate, severe and critical pneumonia [9] . According data released by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on February 17, 2020, a total of 44,672 cases (61.8%) has been confirmed COVID-19 [10] . Among them, more than 80% are mild or moderate with relatively good short-term prognosis due to self-limiting process. However, 6,168 (13.8%) cases belong to the severe type and is more likely to develop All rights reserved.

Although some data regarding clinical characteristics of COVID-19 has been recently revealed [5-7, 10, 11] , those focusing on patients with the severe type is scarce. Moreover, since SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous with prior SARS-CoV, it comes naturally that they may have similar clinical features, such as highly contagious infection, high lethality rate, and even sex differences [12] .In this study, we aim to compare clinical findings between men and women with severe type of COVID-19, and hope to contribute to the prevention and treatment.All rights reserved.

Data collection

We obtained demographic, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and outcome data from patients' medical records. Blood oxygen saturation was measured after oxygen therapy. Clinical outcomes were followed up by February 22, 2020.Laboratory tests were conducted within 24 hours after admission, including a complete blood count, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, Ferritin, hypersensitive troponin I (hsTnI) and N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP).

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables were expressed as median (IQR) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared by χ² test or Fisher's exact test between the men and women groups.

Results

From February 8 to February 11, 2020, 47 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were classified as severe pneumonia at the area, 28 (59.6%) cases were men. About 63.8% of patients had comorbidities. History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was non-significant higher but hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) was lower in men than in women. The initial symptoms were mainly fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue.Three men and one woman had oxygen saturation below 93% after routine nasal oxygen supply (Table 1) . the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is The serum procalcitonin and NTproBNP level were higher in men than in women.

Discussion

In this retrospective study, we analyzed data from 47 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 of severe type. Common symptoms were similar between men and women, consistent with the recent research [6, 7, 11, 13 ]. Men were more likely to have prior COPD, develop secondary infections, receive complicated treatments as well as experience worse in-hospital outcomes, as compared to women.During two-week treatment, men accounted for five of six patients (83.3%)shifting from severe to critical type. On the other side, only one man (20.0%) in five patients discharged from hospital. The similar phenomenon has also been reported in prior SARS-CoV infection in 2003. Karlberg et al. [12] analyzed 1755 SARS cases and found that men had a significantly higher mortality than women did (21.9% versus 13.2%, p < 0.0001). Leung et al. [14] showed that male sex was independently associated with a greater risk for adverse events in SARS patients. Interestingly, there is no clear evidence showing the sex difference in prognosis of influenza [15] [16] [17] . It seems that the different prognosis between men and women might be a feature for coronavirus infections.The reason for sex difference is unknown. Some studies suggested that different outcomes between men and women could be explained by estrogen which might protect females from worse outcomes after SARS-CoV infection [12, 18] . Another possible explanation for this is that the prevalence of malignancy was higher in males. Liang et al. [19] found that in severe COVID-19 patients, those with cancer had poorer outcomes from COVID-19.In addition, more men in our study were co-infected with bacteria or influenza virus, which may somewhat result in high risk.Rothberg et al. [20] reported that bacterial infection was a common pulmonary complication of influenza. We found that positive influenza A antibody were detected in 5 men patients but not in women. Otherwise a higher rate of increased procalcitonin was also observed in men. These findings suggested that men with severe COVID-19 is susceptible to secondary infections with virus or bacteria, resulting in higher utilization rate of advanced antiviral therapy and antibiotics. Chen et al. [11] observed that 71% of confirmed COVID-19 patients used antibiotic treatment, but no comparison between men and women. It will be clinically meaningful to further investigate why and which type of influenza virus or bacteria are more likely to co-infect with SARS-CoV-2 in men.Another, we observed that NTproBNP but not cTnI was higher in men, suggesting more damage in heart function might exist in men after SARS-CoV-2 infection. It was reported that women were associated with less remodeling after cardiac injury, due to the protection of estrogens [21] . Our findings imply that physicians should pay more attention to cardiac function in men with severe COVID-19.All rights reserved.

"Abstract

Summary Statement: DUX4 is thought to mediate cytopathology through p53. Here, DUX4 is shown to kill primary myoblasts and promote pathological phenotypes in the iDUX4[2.7] mouse model on the p53-null background, calling into question this notion.FSHD is a genetically dominant myopathy caused by mutations that cause expression of the normally silent DUX4 gene. This transcription factor has been shown to interfere with myogenesis when misexpressed at very low levels in myoblasts, and to cause cell death when overexpressed at high levels. A previous report using adeno-associated virus to deliver high levels of DUX4 to mouse skeletal muscle demonstrated severe pathology that was suppressed on a p53 knockout background, implying that DUX4 acted through the p53 pathway. Here, we investigate the p53-dependence of DUX4 using both in vitro cellular and the transgenic iDUX4[2.7] mouse models. We find that inhibiting p53 has no effect on the cytoxicity of DUX4 in vitro. When crossed onto the p53 null background, we find no suppression of the male-specific lethality or skin phenotypes of the DUX4 transgene, and find that primary myoblasts from this mouse are still killed by DUX4 expression. These data challenge the notion that the p53 pathway is central to the pathogenicity of DUX4.166 words. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

","Introduction

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) affects over 25,000 people in the U.S. alone, making it one of the most prevalent genetic diseases. The genetic mutation underlying FSHD is usually a reduction in the copy number of a macrosatellite repeat on chromosome 4 referred to as D4Z4 (van Deutekom et al. 1993; Wijmenga et al. 1992 ). This repeat is GC-rich, highly methylated, and normally subjected to repeat-induced silencing, which is disrupted in an allelespecific manner by contractions to 10 or fewer copies (van Overveld et al. 2003) or on all D4Z4 repeats by mutation in the chromatin protein SMCHD1 (de Greef et al. 2009; Hartweck et al. 2013 ; Lemmers et al. 2012) . When silencing at D4Z4 breaks down, an RNA transcript encoding the DUX4 protein (Gabriels et al. 1999 ) is expressed. The presence of a poly(A) signal downstream of the D4Z4 repeats on chr4 (Dixit et al. 2007 ) leads to DUX4 expression and explains why disease is associated only with contractions of the D4Z4 repeats on chr4, and only on specific 4qter alleles, so called permissive alleles, which harbor the poly(A) signal (Lemmers et al. 2010; Lemmers et al. 2004 ). The DUX4 protein has been observed by immunostaining of cultured FSHD myoblasts which show infrequent, possibly episodic, expression (Jones et al. 2012; Snider et al. 2010 ) and differentiated myotubes which show more prevalent expression (Block et al. 2013; Rickard, Petek and Miller 2015) .Mechanisms of DUX4-mediated pathology are currently being investigated actively. At high levels of expression, DUX4 causes toxicity that leads to cell death of myoblasts (Bosnakovski et al. 2008; Kowaljow et al. 2007 ), while at low levels of expression, it impairs myogenic differentiation (Dandapat et al. 2014) and sensitizes cells to oxidative stress (Bosnakovski et al. 2008 ). A mouse model allowing doxycycline-regulated DUX4 expression has recapitulated these phenotypes in primary myoblasts (Dandapat et al. 2014) while also having several nonmuscle related phenotypes due to low basal levels of DUX4 expression in the absence of All rights reserved.

Other animal model work includes a mouse carrying human D4Z4 repeats (Krom et al. 2013) which showed some evidence of sporadic DUX4 expression, but no myopathy; and adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated delivery of DUX4 to skeletal muscle, which showed profound myopathy (Wallace et al. 2011 ). This latter work implicated the p53 pathway in DUX4 pathology, as the p53 knockout background suppressed AAV-DUX4 toxicity. The linkage to p53 is compelling, as this pathway has the potential to push cells into apoptosis, however precisely how DUX4 would activate p53 is not clear. The immediate targets of the DUX4 transcription factor include genes with regulatory elements containing the sequence TAATCTAATCA (Geng et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2015) , or variants thereof. ChIP-seq has identified many genomic targets (Choi et al. 2016; Geng et al. 2012 ) and at the majority of these, DUX4 displaces nucleosomes, recruits p300 and/or CBP through its C-terminus which promotes acetylation of histone H3 and activation of transcription (Choi et al. 2016 ).Here, we directly test the p53-dependence of the pathogenic phenotypes of DUX4 expression, by inhibiting p53 in cell lines while DUX4 is expressed, and by crossing the iDUX4[2.7] transgene onto the p53 knockout background. These experiments reveal that p53 is not necessary for DUX4-mediated pathology, neither in myoblasts, nor in other tissues.

Results

Previously, overexpression of Pax3 or Pax7 was been shown to reduce the toxicity of DUX4 to C2C12 mouse myoblasts (Bosnakovski et al. 2008) . To see to what extent inhibiting p53 could similarly reduce DUX4 toxicity, we transduced iC2C12-DUX4 cells, which are immortalized mouse myoblasts engineered for doxycycline-inducible DUX4 expression, with retroviral vectors expressing several constructs known to interfere with p53: a dominant negative p53 (R175H All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/118315 doi: bioRxiv preprint mutation), MDM2 (Momand et al. 1992) , and TRIM24 (Allton et al. 2009 ). Overexpressing cell lines were established and cells were exposed to two different doses of doxycycline, both of which resulted in significant cell killing in the absence of overexpression (empty vector control).Notably, although the positive controls, Pax3 and Pax7, protected substantially at 24 hours, cells transduced with the three p53 inhibitors did not show a reduced death rate compared to empty vector (Fig. 1 ). This indicates that in this system, p53 is not a relevant player in the cell death phenotype.We have previously generated a mouse model with a doxycycline-inducible 2.7 kb DUX4 transgene (Dandapat et al. 2014; Dandapat et al. 2016) , referred to as iDUX4[2.7]. One of the interesting features of this mouse is that the very low basal level of expression from the Tet-on promoter in the absence of doxycycline leads to various non-muscle phenotypes, especially in males, where 80% die as embryos, with the remaining 20% being severely runted and all dying before 6 weeks of age. Females are less severely affected and can thus propagate the strainbecause the transgene is X-linked, X-inactivation diminishes the phenotype in females. We reasoned that if p53 were necessary for the pathological effects of DUX4 on embryonic cell types, then on a p53 knockout background, males ought to be born at normal ratios, and ought to be relatively healthy compared to siblings with a functional copy of p53. We therefore crossed the iDUX4[2.7] transgene onto the p53 knockout background. Female carriers were obtained that were homozygous for the p53 knockout and these were bred to male p53 heterozygotes. We genotyped 65 progeny from this backcross and obtained no DUX4+ males, neither on the p53 knockout nor on the heterozygous background (Fig. 2) . Thus, absence of p53 has no effect on the pathological effects of DUX4 on development in the iDUX4[2.7] strain.Although no males were produced from the backcross described above, we did eventually obtain live born p53 iDUX4[2.7] knockout males from F1 crosses to Rosa-rtTA p53 double All rights reserved.

These sorted primary cultures were then exposed to doxycycline over a series of doses to induce DUX4 expression to different levels. DUX4 expression was clearly cytopathic (Fig. 3A) and caused a dose-dependent loss of cellular viability in myoblasts (Fig. 3B) . The same was observed for fibroadipogenic progenitors (Fig.   3B ) on the p53 knockout background. Thus, in the absence of p53, DUX4 is still cytotoxic, to both myogenic and fibroadipogenic progenitors.

Discussion

Using both the inducible C2C12 cell culture system, where it was originally demonstrated that DUX4 was pathogenic to myogenic progenitors (Bosnakovski et al. 2008) , and the iDUX4[2.7] mouse model (Dandapat et al. 2014 ), we find no evidence for p53 involvement in DUX4 pathogenicity. Interestingly, this applies to phenotypes caused by very low basal levels of DUX4 expression, as the developmental effects and runting are thought to be, as well as overt cytotoxicity in primary or immortalized cells, which is the result of high level DUX4 expression.The previous study implicating p53 in DUX4 toxicity made use of a very different experimental system with vastly higher levels of DUX4 expression: recombinant adeno-associated virus vector-mediated production. The levels of DUX4 expression achieved in a cell infected with multiple copies of DUX4 driven from the CMV promoter are much higher than those in which DUX4 is expressed from its endogenous promoter from a single (terminal) D4Z4 repeat in All rights reserved.

It is possible that at these exceptionally high levels of expression, the p53 pathway does in fact become necessary for some aspect of extreme pathology, however the relevance of such high levels of expression is debatable. The nature of the muscle damage seen in the AAV model is quite distinct from that seen in FSHD, and DUX4 expression is in fact quite difficult to detect in biopsies of FSHD muscle, to the point where the most reliable readout of its expression in biopsies is its target gene fingerprint (Yao et al. 2014 ). It is also theoretically possible that some aspect of the AAV experimental system combines with the effect of DUX4 to make the pathology more severe than it would otherwise have been, and the p53 effect ascribed to DUX4 was in fact downstream of the cellular response to AAV infection.Nevertheless, the studies presented here clearly demonstrate that p53 is not necessary for cytotoxicity of DUX4.

Mice

Animal work was conducted under a protocol approved by the University of Minnesota IACUC.The p53 mutant allele used in these studies was obtained from Jackson Labs (strain 008651) and carries a floxed stop codon upstream of a dominant negative (R270H) p53 mutant. In the absence of cre, no functional p53 is produced, thus as used in the current study, it is a null allele. Mice homozygous for this allele developed papillomas and most eventually succumbed to thymic lymphomas, as predicted for a p53 null.

"Abstract

Background: Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are caused by coronaviruses and have infected people in China and worldwide. We aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 and SARS exhibited similar spatial and temporal features at the provincial level in mainland China.

","

Compared to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which was also caused by a similar coronavirus, COVID-19 has been much more transmissible and rapidly spread from a single city to the entire country in just 30 days [2] . The estimated basic reproductive numbers (R0s) for COVID-19 and SARS were approximately 3.1 [3] and 2.7 [4] , respectively. The transmission mechanisms of COVID-19 are currently poorly understood, although this disease is considered to be one of the most widespread and destructive infectious diseases. There is a need for a more integrated investigation and coordinated international response to the outbreak.Spatiotemporal analyses, which integrate spatial and time-series analyses, can provide additional information on the persistence of patterns over time and illuminate any unusual patterns.Therefore, in this study, by collecting the daily numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 and SARS cases during the two epidemics, we aimed to determine the spatial behavior and temporal features of the COVID-19 spread in mainland China and compared then with the respective features from the SARS epidemic using .

Data source

The present study included incident cases of COVID-19 and SARS in 31 provinces (provincial-level regions on the Chinese mainland). Incident cases infected by COVID-19were extracted from the daily briefings on novel coronavirus cases from Jan. 20 to Mar. 4, 2020, provided on the official website of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China [5] . We confirmed the daily total numbers of reported cases with the surveillance data provided by the WHO [6] .Incident cases of SARS were extracted from daily situation reports for mainland China from Apr. 21 to Aug. 3, 2003 , which were posted by China.org.cn (in Chinese) andwere also provided by the National Health Commission. We confirmed the daily total numbers of reported cases of SARS with the cumulative numbers of reported cases provided by the WHO [7] . The SARS data were left-truncated when day-by-day data before Apr. 21, 2002 were not available for each province.

Case definition

Cases of COVID-19 included diagnosed cases confirmed by at least one of the following three methods: isolation of COVID-19 virus, at least two positive results for COVID-19 virus by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay or a genetic sequence that matches COVID-19 virus [8] . A clinically diagnosed case was defined as a suspected case with imaging features of pneumonia, which has only been only applicable in Hubei Province since Feb. 12, 2020 [9]..

Statistical analyses

We used ArcGIS software v10.2.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) to depict the spatial distribution and perform global and local spatial autocorrelation analyses. We used Kulldorff's space-time scan statistical analysis to detect the space-time clusters of SARS and COVID-19 and to verify whether the geographic clustering was caused by random variation. Considering the relatively low incidence rate, we used the discrete Poisson probability model as the scanning statistical model. In Kulldorff's space-time scanning, the radius of the population coverage was used, and the maximum spatial scanning area was set to cover 10% of the risk population. The maximum temporal scanning window was set to cover 50% of the total research time. The scan window was increased gradually from 0 to the maximum, and the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) were calculated for each window. The window with the maximum likelihood was defined as the most likely cluster area. Other clusters with statistically significant LLRs were defined as the secondary potential clusters. The LLR P-value was estimated through 99,999 Monte Carlo simulations. A P-value < 0.05 indicated a significantly high risk inside of the scan window and a potential high-risk cluster of the disease.

Thus, the selection of the maximum radius of the spatial scanning window and the maximum length of the temporal scanning window were very important. In this study, we selected the maximum spatial cluster sizes as 10% and 30% of the total population at risk and the maximum temporal cluster sizes as 50% of the total study period. Based on the optimal spatiotemporal parameters, retrospective space-time scanning analysis was applied to identify the geographic areas and time periods of potential clusters with significantly higher COVID-19 and SARS incidence than those of nearby areas.The spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted by using Open GeoDa software v1.2.0 (GeoDa Center for Geospatial Analysis and Computation, Arizona State University, AZ, USA). To identify the spatial clustering of the COVID-19 and SARS incidence at the provincial level, we used row standardized first-order contiguity Rook neighbors as the criterion for identifying neighbors, as described in [11] . We calculated Moran's I value and the local indicators of spatial association (LISA) statistic to analyze the global and local clusters as well as spatial outliers. There were four categories of spatial patterns in the LISA map. The high-high and low-low locations (positive local spatial autocorrelation) were typically referred to as spatial clusters, while the high-low and low-high locations (negative local spatial autocorrelation) were termed spatial outliers. A cluster was computed as such when the value at a location (either high or low) was more similar to its neighbors than would be the case under spatial randomness. The .

We also performed spatiotemporal clustering analysis for COVID-19 by excluding cases in Hubei. (range: 0.00-16.72). (Fig. 1) .

Temporal trends and patterns

To illustrate the spread of the two diseases nationally, we plotted the temporal changes in COVID-19 and SARS in 31 provinces in mainland China (Fig. 2 , ordered by .

Identification of spatiotemporal clusters

Through spatiotemporal clustering analysis, we identified 4 high-risk clusters for COVID-19 within 4 cluster time frames (Fig. 3a) . The most likely cluster was the epicenter, Hubei, with an RR of 135 compared with the neighboring provinces and the longest high-risk period of 22 days (P < 0.001). Two significant secondary clusters were identified in Zhejiang (from Jan. 28 to Jan. 30, 2020, P < 0.001) and Shandong (in Feb. 20, 2020, P < 0.001), with similar RRs of 1.64 and 1.56, respectively. Another possible cluster was identified in Jiangxi (from Feb. 3 to Feb. 4, 2020, P = 0.982).When considering the measure of quarantine in Hubei, the RR of 223 in stage 2 (from Feb. 7 to Mar. 4, 2020) was largely increased compared to the RR of 69 in stage 1 (Jan. 20 to Feb. 6, 2020) (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). There were different spatial behaviors and temporal features between the two stages. When excluding cases in Hubei, the high-risk clusters were centered on the areas around Hubei and in Beijing, Shanghai, and .

Moreover, the RRs in both stages were significantly decreased for the most likely cluster, with RRs of 3.56 in stage 1 and 5.31 in stage 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2) .Different from COVID-19, the most likely cluster of SARS was centered on Beijing ( Fig. 3b) 

Spatial autocorrelation

The global Moran's I values for COVID-19 and SARS were -0.022 and 0.073, respectively (both P > 0.05), which indicated that the case distribution may have been due to chance rather than global autocorrelation (Fig. 4) .The LISA cluster map showed the significant locations color coded by the type of spatial autocorrelation. For COVID-19, the high-low spatial clustering was in HubeiProvince. In addition, we identified 4 significant clusters at P < 0.01 and 5 significant clusters at P < 0.05. Specifically, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and most western provinces had significantly low-low spatial clustering, whereas Anhui, Hunan and Jiangxi of Central China had significantly low-high spatial clustering. For SARS, two significant high-high (Beijing and Tianjin) and low-high (Hebei) clusters were detected. Sichuan, Tibet and Anhui showed significant low-low clustering (Fig. 4) ..

Discussion

In our study, we found that there were different spatiotemporal clustering patterns between COVID-19 and SARS. Compared to SARS, COVID-19 had a higher incidence as well as wider and faster transmission in mainland China. The significant high-risk areas for COVID-19 were predominantly clustered in south-central China, around Hubei, from Jan. 28 to Feb. 18. Additionally, our results showed that the quarantine measure taken in Hubei might have played a crucial role in restricting the infected areas, shortening the epidemic period, and reducing the national infected risk of the disease.The 2003 SARS outbreaks represented one of the most serious public health challenges to China and the world [12] . Seventeen years later, the outbreak of COVID-19 could encounter a similar situation but lead to a different outcome. The different transmission mechanisms of these coronaviruses can also present different spatial and temporal distributions nationally and globally. For SARS, we observed that the distance transmission chain started from Guangdong to Beijing and the nearby provinces.However, for COVID-19, we observed a shorter transmission chain around Hubei but a wider infected region nationally. Outside the epicenter, we identified more secondary clusters for SARS, which indicated that the transmission was wider for second generations. Compared to SARS, the secondary clusters of COVID-19 were mainly clustered around Hubei. This could be explained by the relatively high infection rate nationally, as well as the different demographic factors and local government containment strategies regionally. Another secondary cluster identified in Shandong around Feb. 20 was mainly due to the newly reported cases previously identified in jails [13] . Because the reporting system of the jails was independent from the national .

When these cases were not considered, the incidence was generally low during the last two weeks in February.Because the mandatory quarantine for Hubei (""Wuhan lockdown"") has been in effect since Jan. 23, 2020, and because social-distancing measures, such as population movement restrictions, school closures and temperature monitoring at public locations, have also been in effect in most provinces in mainland China since this date, we distinguished the spatial patterns of the COVID-19 epidemic before and after this date plus a 14-day incubation period. We found that COVID-19 cases were clustered mainly in Hubei, and other secondary clusters disappeared, except in Shandong. This reinforced that quarantine and isolation can help to contain the virus, prevent transmission and effectively reduce the number of secondary clusters.The present study was based on the daily briefings provided by the health department.Although our study covered the peak period of the outbreaks in most provinces, transmission patterns of SARS in Beijing and Guangdong were biased due to lack of the available data before Apr. 21, 2003. Comparatively, reported cases for COVID-19 could also be biased due to missing data before Jan. 21, 2020 in this study. Moreover, early infections with atypical presentations may have been missed [14] . Therefore, the conclusions should be interpreted with caution with regard to the early stages of the two epidemic outbreaks. When more data become available on transmission patterns and epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS, a detailed comparison with the corresponding characteristics between the two diseases would be more informative..

"Abstract

We study a novel multi-strain SIR epidemic model with selective immunity by vaccination. A newer strain is made to emerge in the population when a preexisting strain has reached equilbrium. We assume that this newer strain does not exhibit cross-immunity with the original strain, hence those who are vaccinated and recovered from the original strain become susceptible to the newer strain. Recent events involving the COVID-19 virus demonstrates that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well-known virus with a vaccine readily available for some of its strains, is active in a population. We solved for four different equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability. The reproduction number was also determined for the epidemiological model and found to be consistent with the local stability condition for the disease-free equilibrium. 4 susceptibility to diseases amongst others [1-3]. The drop in numbers in vaccination has 5 led to outbreaks of diseases such as mumps [4-6] that could have been prevented by 6

More recently, the anti-vaccination movement has been gaining traction in different 2 parts of the world. Individuals who do not advocate vaccination commonly cite reasons 3 such as fear of adverse side-effects, perceived low efficacy of vaccines, and perceived low influenza-like illness in Israel accounting for weather and antigenic drift by adding terms 48 that account for weather signals and lost of immunity. Finkenstadt et al. [31] created a 49 predictive stochastic SIRS model for weekly flu incidence accounting for antigenic drift. 50 Roche et al. [32] used an agent-based SIR model to describe the spread of a multi-strain 51 epidemic, while Shi et al. [33] used the same approach and empirical data from Georgia, 52 USA to model an influenza pandemic that incorporates viral mutation and seasonality. 53 However, these approaches have been stochastic in nature, which does not provide 54 information regarding the stability and existence of equilibrium points in an infected 55 population. The abovementioned articles also do not take vaccination and the presence 56 of other strains into account in their models. Consequently, one can model the presence 57 of a mutated virus spreading into a population using a multi-strain model, which was 58 used in the following studies for avian flu [23, 24] . These models study the birds and the 59 humans as one population in an SI-SIR model, where the first SI corresponds to the 60 compartments for the avian species. However, the two infected compartments in this 61 model do not cross since they are separated by species. Casagrandi et al. [25] 62 introduced a non-linear deterministic SIRC epidemic model to model the influenza A 63 virus undergoing an antigenic drift. The SIRC model is a modified SIR model with an 64 additional compartment, C, for individuals that receive partial immunity from being which did not investigate the equilibrium model in detail.In the case of the influenza virus, it is possible to have multiple strains exist in a 72 population, but only have vaccine for a certain strain that will not be effective for 73 others. The fact that viruses undergo changes regularly indicates that people who have 74 recovered from the virus, as well as individuals who have been vaccinated for a specific 75 strain of the virus, can be susceptible again to a newly-emerged strain. It is important 76 to determine the conditions in which a newly emerged strain and a common strain that 77 has a means of immunity will coexist in a population. 78 Another apt example for emerging diseases is the emergence of the COVID- 19 virus 79 in 2019 [39, 40] . As of March 17, 2020, there have been 167,545 confirmed cases of 80 COVID-19 in 150 different countries that has led to 6,606 deaths since it was declared 81 as an outbreak in January 2020 according to the WHO situation report [41] . At the 82 time that this paper is being written, there are papers that have modeled the dynamics 83 of the virus using different modifications of the SIR model. Zhou et. al. [42] included 84 compartments corresponding to suspected cases, which consists of the individuals that 85 show similar symptoms but are not confirmed cases, and indirectly infected individuals. 86 Pan et. al. [43] used a modified SEIR model which included asymptomatic and given that one of these strains has a vaccine available. This paper introduces a model 97 that approaches the lack of cross-immunity across different viral strains by introducing 98 new compartments to the SIR with vaccination model. This enables us to introduce 99 acquired immunity through vaccination and cross-immunity between strains in a simple 100 compartmental model and investigate the existence and stability of the resulting 101 equilibrium points. We aim to model the dynamics of an epidemic where a new emergent strain of an 103 existing virus affects a closed population. The existing virus will be modeled using a 104 modified SIR model with vaccination, however we assume that the vaccine does not 105 provide immunity to the newer strain. The equilibrium points were determined for the 106 system based on the transition equations and local stability was investigated for each 107 point. Once the stability conditions have been established, the epidemic model was 108 simulated using R [46] to check the steady-state behavior of the surveillance data for next two subsections will explain the dynamics before and after the emergence of the 124 mutated strain.

125

Before emergence 126 The system starts off as a population exposed to the original strain of the virus. The 127 spread of the virus is described by a modified SIR model that accounts for 128 vaccination [34] . The vaccinated members of the population can be treated as members 129of an additional compartment that do not interact with the infected individuals. This 130 means that the modified SIR model will have four compartments instead of three, which 131 that the individuals are vaccinated at birth with a vaccination rate p. β is the standard 146 incidence transmission coefficient, which assumes that the infection occurs based on how 147 many susceptible individuals interact with the infected [47] . For standard incidence, the 148 contact rate between infected and susceptible individuals is constant over all infected 149 individuals regardless of the population size [48] . The removal rate coefficient for the 150 infected individuals is denoted by γ.

151

The dynamics of the system is described by ordinary differential equations that where the rates are denoted in the compartment diagram shown in Fig 1. For the infected compartment I 1 , the number of infected individuals increase when 161 susceptible individuals get infected at a rate βSI 1 N . The infected individuals can either 162 die at a rate of µI 1 or get removed and not interact with the system again at a rate γI 1 163 when they recover. Translating this to an ordinary differential equation yieldsUnlike the members of the susceptible compartment, the individuals in the .

The resulting endemic equilibrium 185 point (s * , i * 1 , v * ) is given by,According to Chauhan et. al [34] , the reproduction number of the disease for the 187 vaccinated SIR model is given by to the existence of another compartment I 2 for those who are infected with the new 196 strain, which we will refer to as Disease 2.

197

The existence of the newer strain will be constrained by the following assumptions: 198Since the vaccine is assumed to only work on the original strain, the vaccinated 199 and the previously removed individuals are susceptible to the newer strain. 

206

This means that the number of compartments that need to be monitored will increase 207 from four to six, with the addition or modification of the following compartments: .

As in Chauhan et. al's [34] work, the standard incidence was used to model infection 221 of the susceptible individuals for the newer strain. Based on Eq 1 and the compartment 222 diagram in Fig 2, the dynamics of the system can be expressed in terms of the following 223 ordinary differential equations:and To solve for the equilibrium points of the system, Eqs 11-15 should be equal to zero. 228Wolfram Mathematica [49] was used to obtain solutions for the system of equations, 229 which are the following:3. New strain equilibrium:is the reproduction number of the original 240 strain for the SIR model with vaccination [34] .

241

The third equilibrium corresponds to the scenario where only the new strain survives. 242For this equilibrium point to exist, the following condition should be satisfied: For the endemic equilibrium to exist, the following condition should be satisfied:The next section will discuss the local stability of the four equilibrium points.

Stability analysis and simulations 249

After solving for the equilibrium points, we need to determine the conditions in which 250 these points are stable. These conditions dictate which equilibrium will describe the 251 steady state behavior of the system. The local stability of the equilibrium points will be 252 March 17, 2020 11/29.

For any equilibrium point, (s,ī 1 ,v,r,ī 2 ) yieldsLocal stability is attained when the eigenvalues of the Jacobian, λ, are negative or 259 have negative real parts. In other words, the solutions for λ such that det(J − 1λ) = 0 260should be negative or have negative real parts if the solution is complex [50] .

Disease free equilibrium (DFE) 278 The Jacobian for the DFE can be obtained by substituting the respective values to 279 (s,ī 1 ,v,r,ī 2 ) in the expression for the Jacobian. This yields:and the corresponding characteristic equation isThis means that the eigenvalues are 282Recall that for the DFE to be locally 283 asymptotically stable, all eigenvalues should have negative real parts. Hence, the 284 following conditions should hold:This is consistent with the local stability of the disease-free equilibrium for the 286 regular standard incidence SIR and the SIR with vaccination models [34] .

The resulting 309 eigenvalues are (−µ, −µ, β µ βThe discriminant of λ ± can dictate whether the eigenvalues will have a negative real 311part. If the discriminant is negative or zero, then the eigenvalues will be negative. If the 312 discriminant is positive, recall that for the system to not go to the DFE, R 0 (1 − p) > 1. 313This means thatwhich ensures that λ ± is negative whenwould have a positive real part which makes the equilibrium point unstable. This 316 suggests that this equilibrium point will not be stable if the system was not already in 317 endemic equilibrium with Disease 1.

318

For the third eigenvalue to be negative,When these conditions are satisfied, then the Disease 1 equilibrium point is locally 320 asymptotically stable. These conditions also imply that this equilibrium point can only 321 be achieved if the system before the emergence is already in endemic equilibrium with 322Disease 1.

330

Note that the reproduction number of the emergent strain is 1.11 which is greater than 331 one, meaning the emergent strain will be able to survive on its own in this population. 332This implies that the new strain is not strong enough to infect enough people to 333 dominate over the original strain.

The behavior of the second strain is similar to 370 that in Fig 5. This implies that the new emergent strain is much more infectious than 371 the older strain that the new strain infects more susceptible individuals compared to the 372 original strain. This causes the original strain to die down at steady state. 373 Fig 6.

For the endemic equilibrium case, both i 1 and i 2 are nonzero and thus both Eq 28 and 375 32 hold. Since Eq 11 is zero,The resulting Jacobian for the endemic equilibrium case is given byThe characteristic equation is given bywhere 379 March 17, 2020 18/29 .

Eq 39 shows that one of the eigenvalues is λ = −pµ/v * which 381 is negative. For all the roots of the quartic term to have negative real parts, the 382 Routh-Hurwitz criteria for stability should be applied [16, 17] . According to the 383 Routh-Hurwitz criterion, a polynomial with degree 4 will have roots (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 ) that 384all have negative real parts when:Since the values of the equilibrium points should be positive, all coefficients 386 (a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 4 ) are positive. Based on the stability of the first three equilibrium points 387 and the existence criterion, the endemic equilibrium point is expected to be stable when 388This implies that the endemic equilibrium for the two strains can only occur when 389 the system is initially in endemic equilibrium for the original strain, which can explain 390 why the condition is more restrictive than the one for the equilibrium with Disease 2. .

Reproduction number [28] 406 One of the important parameters to be calculated for an epidemic model is the 407 reproduction number, which quantifies how infectious a certain disease is. Formally, the 408 reproduction number is defined as the expected number of secondary infections caused 409 by a single infected individual for the whole duration that they are infectious. A value 410 for the reproduction number that is greater than one indicates that the epidemic 411 persists in the population, while a value less than one means that the disease will die 412 out in the population [28, 29] .

413

This means that the reproduction number R 0 for this system is given by the larger of 447 the two. Formally,Note that the resulting threshold equation for the system is R 0 less than one, which 449 means that the system will only approach the disease free equilibrium when Eq 53 is 450 less than one. For an outbreak to occur, at least one of these two strains should be able 451to persist in the population on its own, that is, to have an individual reproduction .

After establishing the possible transitions between compartments, the 459 system was found to have four equilibrium points: the disease free equilibrium, the 460 existing strain equilibrium, the emergent strain equilibrium, and the endemic 461 equilibrium. Upon examining the conditions for existence and local stability, the 462 disease-free equilibrium was determined to be locally stable when both R v and R 0 are 463 less than one. This is consistent with the reproduction number for this multi-strain 464 model. The existing strain equilibrium surprisingly did not impose that R 0 < 1, which 465 is the condition for the DFE of a normal SIR model for a single-strain without 466 immunity. This implies that if the original strain is much more contagious than the 467 emergent strain, the emergent strain would still die out eventually regardless of the fact 468 that it would persist in the population if it was on its own. On a similar note, the local 469 stability condition for the emergent equilibrium condition also does not impose that 470 R v < 1. This means that the state of the system prior to the emergence of the new 471 strain does not matter as long as the emergent strain is more contagious than the 472 existing strain. This leaves a highly restrictive condition for endemic equilibrium to 473 exist: the emergent strain must be able to survive by itself and the original strain must 474 be contagious enough to infect enough people, which is given by Eq 44. Eq 44 also 475 implies that the two-strain endemic equilibrium will only be locally asymptotically .

The local stability of 494 the equilibrium points as well as the reproduction number for the model were calculated. 495Based on the results, we found that the original and the emergent strain can coexist in 496 an endemic equilibrium if the emergent strain has a lower reproduction number than 497 the original strain and that the system should already be in endemic equilibrium with 498 the original disease before the emergence. The requirement for the endemic equilibrium 499 to exist is quite strict especially for low values of R 0 and high values of p, which 500 presents a challenge in simulating surveillance data with stochastic incidence rates.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective, single-centre study based on the People's Hospital of Daofu county. More than 90% of locally confirmed infected cases were recruited between 26th Jan and 28th February 2020. We defined asymptotic infected cases as the ones who got positive results on PCR test for SARS-Cov-2 infection but without any clinical symptoms during the whole surveillance period. Information on epidemiological, demographic characteristics, clinical features, treatment, and outcome were extracted from patients' medical records. Clinical data were followed up until 6thMarch, 2020. The study was approved by West China Hospital Ethics Committee (reference no.2020-190) and written informed consent was obtained from patients in People's Hospital of Daofu county before enrolment.

Results

18 (18/83, 21.7%) individuals were identified as asymptomatic carriers, with a predominant distribution of males (61.0%) ( Table 1 ). The median age was 31 years and one third of the asymptomatic individuals were students, aged under 20 years. Only 1 infected people (5.6%) had pre-existed chronic illness. Epidemiological data showed all the infection were caused by community transmission. Notably, some of asymptomatic carriers had recognizable changes in radiological and laboratory indexes. 7(38.9%) cases had abnormalities in chest computed tomography (CT), representing as unilateral or bilateral patchy shadowing or/and ground-glass opacity (Table 1) . 9(50.0%), 7(38.8%), and 15(83.3%) cases obtained abnormal results in tests of blood routine, .

Discussions

To our knowledge, this is the first descriptive study specifically focusing on a group of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that in Tibetan population, asymptomatic carriers were mainly young or middle-aged healthy individuals, with their infections disappeared after antiviral treatment. Importantly, although no clinical symptoms, many of them have typically viral pneumonia-like changes in chest CT images and abnormal laboratory measures.The possible abnormal findings on chest CT images among asymptomatic carriers got support from one previous report [2] . However, the common abnormalities in blood tests was never described before [2] [3] [4] . Also, it is notable that there is a considerable proportion of asymptomatic carriers among our study population (21.7%), which was much higher than the rate reported previously (5%) [5] . This may due to a high screening rate for individuals with exposure history in Ganzi area. Alternatively, the genetic variations between Han Chinese and Tibetans may be attributable for these differences.The major merits of our study include a sufficient follow-up period and a high coverage rate of all individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in study area. Our finding indicates a potentially big number of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic carriers in prevalent area, highlighting a necessity of screening individuals with close contact of infected patients, for a better control on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection..

"Abstract

Wuhan. Specific antiviral drug are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 infections. The main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key CoV enzyme that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, which makes it an attractive drug target.In an effort to rapidly discover lead compounds targeting M pro , two compounds (11a and 11b) were designed and synthesized, both of which exhibited excellent inhibitory activity with an IC 50 value of 0.05 μ M and 0.04 μ M respectively. Significantly, both compounds exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in a cell-based assay with an EC 50 value of 0.42 μ M and 0.33 μ M, respectively. The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M pro in complex with 11a and 11b were determined at 1.5 Å resolution, respectively. The crystal structures showed that 11a and 11b are covalent inhibitors, the aldehyde groups of which are bound covalently to Cys145 of M pro . Both compounds showed good PK properties in vivo, and 11a also exhibited low toxicity which is promising drug leads with clinical potential that merits further studies.

sequence identify to SARS-CoV 4, 5, 6 . This novel coronavirus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and the pneumonia was designated as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 7 Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that lack the ability to correct errors occurring during RNA replication. This property results in high variability of CoVs and mutations that occur frequently and quickly under environmental and evolutionary stress. Therefore, RNA CoVs are highly prevalent and severe pathogens of viral diseases 12 . The genomic RNA of CoVs is approximately 30 k nt in length with a 5'-cap structure and 3'-poly-A tail, which has the largest viral RNA genome known to date and contains at least 6 open reading frames (ORFs).There is an a-1 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b which are the first ORF, about two-third of genome length, directly translating polyprotein (pp) 1a/1ab. These polyproteins will be processed by a 3C-like protease (3CL pro ), also named as the main protease (M pro ), and one or two papain-like proteases (PLPs) into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps). Subsequently, these nsps catalyze the synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic RNAs which are used as templates to directly translate main structural author/funder. All rights reserved.

Therefore, these proteases, especially 3CL pro , play a vital role in the life cycle of coronavirus 13, 14, 15, 16 .3CL pro (M pro ) is a three-domain (domains I to III) cysteine protease and involves in most maturation cleavage events within the precursor polyprotein. Active 3CL pro is a homodimer containing two protomers. The CoV 3CL pro features a non-canonical Cys...His dyad located in the cleft between domains I and II 17, 18, 19 . Several common features are shared among the substrates of CoVs 3CL pro , and especially a Gln residue is almost absolutely required for the substrate in the P1 position. 3CL pro is conserved within the group of CoVs. In addition, there is no human homologue of 3CL pro which makes it an ideal antiviral target 20, 21 .

Design and synthesis of a series of peptidomimetic aldehydes as coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitors

The substrates of coronaviruses 3CL pro (M pro ) show some similarity, and most 3CL protease inhibitors are peptidomimetic covalent inhibitors derived from the natural substrates. The active sites are highly conserved among all CoV M pro and are usually composed of four pockets (S1', S1, S2 and S4) 22, 23 . The thiol of a cysteine residue in the S1' pocket can anchor inhibitors by a covalent linkage, which is important for the inhibitors to maintain anti-viral activity. In our design of new inhibitors, the aldehyde was selected as a new warhead in P1' to occupy the S1'pocket.As the (S)-γ-lactam ring has been proved to be suitable in the S1 pocket of 3C pro and 3CL pro , this ring was expected to be a good choice in P1 of new inhibitors. Furthermore, the S2 pocket of coronavirus 3CL pro is usually large enough to accommodate the bigger P2 fragment. To assess the possibility of π -π stacking interactions and hydrophobic interaction with the S2 pocket, the aryl and cyclohexyl group were placed in P2 (compounds 11a and 11b) . Finally, the indole or other heterocyclice groups, which are privileged skeletons, were introduced into P3 in order to form new hydrogen bonds with S4 and improve drug-like properties.Synthetic procedures: The synthetic route and chemical structures of the compounds (11a and 11b) are shown in Scheme 1.

The intermediates 6a and 6b were synthesized from 4 and acid 5a, 5b. After the t-butoxycarbonyl group was removed from 6a and 6b, the intermediates 7a and 7b were obtained. Coupling compounds 7a and 7b with the acid 8 yielded the esters 9a, 9b. The peptidomimetic aldehydes 11a and 11b were approached via a two-step route in which the ester derivatives 9 were first reduced with NaBH 4 to generate the primary alcohols 10a and 10b, which were subsequently oxidized into aldehydes 11a and 11b with Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP).

The difference in binding is probably due to the aryl group of 11b at P2. Compared with the cyclohexyl group in 11a, the aryl group undergoes a significant rotation (Figure 2C) . The side chains of residues His41, Met49, Met165 and Val186 interact with this aryl group through hydrophobic interactions ( Figure   2D ). The side chain of Gln189 stabilizes the aryl group with an additional hydrogen bond ( Figure 2D ). In short, these two crystal structures reveal an identical inhibitory mechanism in that these two compounds occupy the substrate-binding pocket, mimicking the intermediates in the catalytic reaction, which blocks the enzyme activity of SARS-CoV-2 M pro .

Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of 11a and 11b.

To explore the further druggability of the compounds 11a and 11b, both of two compounds were evaluated for its pharmacokinetic properties. As shown in Table S2 , compound 11a given intraperitoneally (5mg/kg) and intravenous (5mg/kg) displayed a long half-life (T 1/2 ) of 4.27 h and 4.41h, a high maximal concentration (C max =2394 author/funder.

Metabolic stability of 13a in mice was also good (CL = 17.4 mL/min/mg). When administered intraperitoneal (20mg/kg), subcutaneous (5mg/kg) and intravenous (5mg/kg), compound 11b also showed good PK properties. Considering the danger of COVID-19, we selected the intravenous drip administration to further study. Compared with 11a administrated via intravenous, the half-life (1.65h) of 11b is shorter and the clearance rate is faster (CL = 20.6 mL/min/mg). Compound 11a was selected for further investigation with intravenous drip dosing on rats and dogs. The results showed ( Table S3 ) that 11a exhibited long T 1/2 (rat, 7.6 h and dog, 5.5h), low clearance rate (rat, 4.01 mL/min/kg and dogs, 5.8 mL/min/kg) and high AUC value (rat, 41500 h*ng/mL and dog, 14900 h*ng/mL)).Those results indicating that compound 11a has good PK properties to warrant further study.

In vivo toxicity evaluation of 11a.

The in vivo toxicity study (Table S4 ) of 11a have been carried out on SD rats and Beagle dogs. The acute toxicity of 11a was conducted on SD rats, and no SD rats died after receiving 40 mg/kg via intravenous drip administration. When the dosage was raised to 60 mg/kg, one of four SD rats was died. The dose range toxicity study of 11a was conducted for seven days in the dosing level at 2, 6, 18 mg/kg on SD rats and at 10-40 mg/kg on Beagle dogs, once daily dosing (QD), by intravenous drip, all animals were clinically observed once a day at least and no obvious toxicity was observed in each group. The results show 11a with low toxicity on rats and dogs. Discussion author/funder. All rights reserved.

"Abstract

In solid tumors, increasing drug penetration promotes their regression and improves the therapeutic index of compounds. However, the heterogeneous extracellular matrix (ECM) acts a steric and interaction barrier that hinders effective transport of therapeutics, including nanomedicines. Specifically, the interactions between the ECM and surface physicochemical properties of nanomedicines (e.g. charge, hydrophobicity) impedes their diffusion and penetration.To address the challenges using existing surface chemistries, we used peptide-presenting phage libraries as a high-throughput approach to screen and identify peptides as coatings with desired physicochemical properties that improve diffusive transport through the tumor microenvironment.Through iterative screening against the ECM and identification by next-generation DNA sequencing and analysis, we selected individual clones and measured their transport by diffusion assays.

Introduction

For successful delivery and efficacy of therapeutics in solid tumors, it is critical for drugs to reach as many target cells as possible to improve their therapeutic index and minimize drug resistance 1 . Increasing penetration of antibodies [2] [3] [4] , small molecule drugs [5] [6] [7] [8] , and nanoparticles [9] [10] [11] [12] through the tumor microenvironment improves drug distribution, achieves tumor regression and significantly improves the therapeutic index of these compounds. The transport of these molecules through the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment significantly depends on their physicochemical properties and their interactions with the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) 13 .The tumor ECM primarily composes of abnormal, overexpressed amounts of collagen, fibronectin, and glycosaminoglycans, which collectively form a net negative charged network that interacts with and impacts transport of molecules through size-based, hydrodynamic, and/or electrostatic interactions 14, 15 .Nanoparticles are promising systems to deliver large quantities of therapeutic cargo while minimizing off-target toxicity in non-tumor tissues (reviewed in 16 ), and engineering these particles for effective transport through the tumor microenvironment is critical towards successful drug delivery. The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, such as shape, size, and surface chemistry, govern their penetration into tumors, and optimization of these properties can enhance their transport for improved accumulation and retention. The tumor ECM acts as a steric barrier that can filter away particles based on size 17, 18 . To address this problem, extensive efforts have been made to synthesize nanoparticles with smaller diameters 10, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] or different non-spherical shapes 19, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 to diffuse through the ECM mesh and improve penetration in select tumor types.While the size and shape of nanoparticles have been engineered to circumvent the steric barrier of the ECM, molecules smaller than the pore size of the tumor ECM remain unable to traverse the barrier; the ECM also acts as an interaction barrier that prevents particle transport due to intermolecular interactions 33 . Here, there has been less work to engineer and optimize the surface chemistries of particles to interact (or not) with the ECM for improved tumor penetration.Studies indicated that positively charged liposomes 34 and poly(lactic-co-glycolic) (PLGA) nanoparticles 35 improved penetration in tumors, whereas in other studies, negatively charged liposomes 36 and gold nanoparticles 37 exhibited improved penetration in spheroids and tumors.Typically, the surfaces of most nanoparticles are functionalized with poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) to improve the systemic circulation half-life, but the PEG coating additionally provides a net neutral, hydrophilic surface that facilitates penetration through the tumor ECM due to its inertness.PEG-coated PLGA and polystyrene nanoparticles exhibited enhanced diffusive transport and penetration through ECM gels 33, 38 and tumor tissues [39] [40] [41] [42] than uncoated positive and/or negative charged particles. While PEGylation has been an attractive strategy for tumor penetration, there are some challenges that limit its feasibility. PEGylation has been shown to hinder cell internalization [43] [44] [45] and endosomal escape 46 needed for drug and gene delivery. Numerous studies have also shown that people possess pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies, which reduces the efficacy and clinical feasibility of PEG-conjugated therapeutics [47] [48] [49] [50] . In addition, repeated systemic dosing of PEGylated formulations can result in the development of anti-PEG antibodies in living subjects [51] [52] [53] . These findings suggest while PEGylation can improve tumor penetration, there are challenges that motivate the need to find alternative surface chemistries.Peptides are attractive biological materials for surface modification of nanomedicines.Their length and sequence can be controlled 54 63 .In this work we use phage display technology as a combinatorial approach to generate and identify peptides as surface coatings to achieve improved diffusive transport through the tumor microenvironment. Phage, or bacterial viruses, can be genetically engineered to display peptides on their protein coat and can be pooled together to generate a collection of peptide-presenting phage libraries with excellent molecular diversity (i.e. 10 5 -10 9 different peptide sequences) 64 .Specifically, we used T7 phage as the scaffold to display and identify peptide coatings. T7 is an icosahedral virus that can be engineered to display 415 copies of a peptide on its gp10 protein coat and has size features (~70 nm diameter) on the scale of conventional synthetic nanoparticles. T7phage are biological nanoparticles that can multivalently display different ""peptide-based"" surface chemistries that can be combinatorially screened to identify peptide coatings. Here, we engineered random peptides to be displayed on T7 phage and screened the library against the selective pressure of ECM components found in solid tumors to collect peptide-presenting phage that permeated through the ECM. After successive rounds of selection, permeating phage were harvested, and using next generation sequencing and analysis, the most frequent peptides and motif sequences were identified and subsequently validated in transport studies. Diffusion assays were done to measure and identify peptide-presenting phage that exhibited most unhindered diffusivity through the ECM. Using one of the selected peptides, P4, as a model, we performed site-directed alanine mutagenesis to study the role of hydrophilicity, charge, and the order of the amino acid sequence on diffusive transport through the ECM. We next measured the ability of select peptide-presenting phage to achieve uptake in ex vivo ECM-rich pancreatic cancer xenografts. To demonstrate its feasibility as a surface coating for synthetic nanoparticles, the tumor penetrating peptide was conjugated onto polystyrene nanoparticles, and their diffusive transport in pancreatic tumor tissue was measured using multiple particle tracking and compared to PEG-functionalized and control uncoated nanoparticles. Phage display provides the molecular diversity that can be leveraged to screen and select peptides as surface coatings that facilitate diffusive transport and establish that charge, hydrophilicity, and their orientation govern transport through the tumor ECM. This work highlights the promise of peptides as alternative surface chemistries to improve transport and delivery of nanomedicines for solid tumors and potentially other disease microenvironments.

Results and Discussion:

The tumor ECM is a barrier that restricts diffusive transport of therapeutics. The interaction between the ECM with the surface physicochemical properties of nanomedicines dictate their transport through this barrier. Here, the objective was to identify peptides as surface coatings using combinatorial selection against the tumor ECM and validate that they improve diffusive transport through the ECM. A second objective was to understand how physicochemical properties of peptides, including charge and hydrophobicity, can affect transport through the ECM barrier.

Screening of peptide-presenting phage libraries against tumor ECM model

We used combinatorial screening (Figure 1a ) with next-generation sequencing and analysis to identify peptides that can achieve diffusive transport through the ECM network present in tumors. A cysteine constrained 9-mer random peptide-presenting T7 phage library was engineered to effectively serve as a collection of peptide-based surface chemistries with a combination of amino acids possessing varying physicochemical properties. The phage library was incubated with a transwell coated with ECM components collagen I (7.8 mg/ml) and hyaluronic acid (HA) (0.84 mg/ml), which are predominant in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancers [65] [66] [67] . The charged ECM components serve as an electrostatic interaction filter that has been shown to hinder diffusion of charged molecules 15, 67 . A 1 mm thickness of tumor ECM was prepared in the insert of a 24-well transwell. The phage library was added at the top of the ECM to allow it to diffuse through the tumor ECM model at 37 ºC. After 1 hour of incubation, phage that permeated through the ECM was collected, and a fraction of the output was quantified by standard double-layer plaque assay. The remaining fraction was amplified in E. coli to make more copies needed for the subsequent round of screening. This screening was iterated for three additional rounds and the overall selection was performed in replicate. Selection of peptides using phage libraries is typically reported from one or two screenings 68, 69 .Iterative screening allows the tumor-like ECM to serve as a selection pressure to filter away phage unable to consistently penetrate through the ECM, irrespective of the heterogeneity of its mesh network. In each replicate, we observed an increased amount of phage that permeated through the tumor-like ECM after four rounds (Figure 1b) . The average library titer (i.e. amount of phage) of both replicates increased 200-fold and 400-fold in the third and fourth round compared to the second round. In the third and fourth rounds, the increase of permeating phage suggests there is enrichment of the library for phage that may possess desired functionalities (i.e. unhindered transport) through the tumor-like ECM. There was no increase in the first two rounds, but the lack of initial enrichment is typically observed in phage selections 70 . The enrichment of phage during selection is expected, as observed with affinity-based panning against specific targets [70] [71] [72] .

From NGS data, we selected one peptide sequence from the original, naïve library as a negative control for our subsequent experiments. This control peptide sequence is present in the original library, but its frequency decreased with successive rounds of selection, which suggests it was unable to withstand the selection pressure of the tumor-like ECM and cannot permeate through the barrier. Two additional sequences, P4 and P5-peptides, were selected from multiple sequence alignment using Seq2Logo as described elsewhere 69, 74 . Here, multiple sequence alignment of the top thirty frequent peptides from the fourth round of both replicates was done to identify the most abundant amino acid at each position of the 7-mer 75 . From this analysis, we generated and selected The selected peptides along with their physicochemical properties (net charge at pH 7.0 and hydropathy/hydrophobicity) are listed in Table 1 . Three of the five sequences selected are hydrophilic, one is hydrophobic, and one of the sequences is neither hydrophilic nor hydrophobic, which we term as hydro-neutral. The net charge of two of the selected sequences is negative, two are positive, and one of them has a net neutral surface charge at pH 7.0. The net charge of all the selected peptides are near neutral, ranging from -1.0 to +1.1. Table 1 .

The T7 phage are biological nanoparticles; the peptide-presenting phage clones have nanoscale dimensions, and in addition, phage have served as a template for molecular assembly of nanoscale materials and have been used in various applications in nanomedicine 76 .The diffusion coefficient of clones is representative of the unhindered diffusivity of individual clones in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) using dynamic light scattering ( Table S1 ). The measured diffusion coefficient of the insertless, WT phage (hydrodynamic diameter ~70 nm) correlates with its theoretical calculation following the Stokes-Einstein equation.

Improved diffusion of selected peptide-presenting phage through in vitro ECM.

Next, we confirmed that selected and motif peptide-presenting phage exhibited improved diffusion through the tumor-mimetic ECM compared to control phage. Here, we measured the diffusion of the peptide-presenting phage through tumor-like ECM using a fluorescence-based microfluidic channel diffusion assay, as described elsewhere 66 . We prepared the ECM within the channel of a microfluidic chamber µ-slide (Figure 3a) . The tumor ECM in the channel provides a semi-infinite barrier to test the diffusivity of the phage clones. The encapsulated DNA of the phage was fluorescently labeled to avoid surface labeling of phage, which could change the surface properties of the phage and affect interaction and transport through the ECM. Phage were added to the input reservoir, and an equal volume of PBS is added to the output reservoir to maintain the hydrostatic pressure and to achieve a concentration gradient through the channels. Fluorescent images of the channel were acquired at different time points and processed to identify the fluorescence intensity at each time point over the distance of the entire channel (Figure 3b) . The normalized intensity value over the channel length and the entire diffusion time was used for nonlinear curve fitting with the Fick's second law of diffusion to calculate the diffusion coefficient of each clone using a customized MATLAB script ( Figure S2 ).The diffusivity of the clones through the ECM varied from 6.40×10 -14 ±2.17×10 -14 m 2 /sec for the negative control-phage to 1.05×10 -13 ±1.27×10 -14 m 2 /sec for P4-phage, which was in the same order of magnitude as the diffusivity of similar sized T4 phage through gels and artificial biofilm models 77, 78 . Comparable values of 1.62×10 -12 m 2 /sec and 3.39×10 -13 m 2 /sec were reported for diffusion of 50 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/659524 doi: bioRxiv preprint properties of the displayed peptide likely impacted binding to the ECM and subsequent diffusion.In particular, the P4-phage demonstrated significantly higher diffusivity through the ECM compared to the control-phage. The hydrophilic and net neutral charged peptide sequence P4 was selected for subsequent studies since it demonstrated highest average diffusivity through the in vitro tumor ECM in the microfluidic and transwell diffusion studies (Figure 3c and Figure S3 ).

Effect of specific physicochemical properties on the diffusivity is investigated by site-directed alanine mutagenesis.

While net-neutral charge, hydrophilic polymer coatings have improved transport of nanocarriers through ECM 33, 39, 41 , the polymer coating consists of a single repeating unit (e.g. H-[O-CH2-CH2]n-OH for PEG). Alternatively, due to molecular diversity of amino acids and their ordering in the peptide sequence, we can systematically manipulate select amino acids and determine their contribution to peptide-mediated transport through the ECM. To determine the impact of charge, hydrophobicity, and spatial order of physicochemical properties on transport through the ECM, we performed alanine mutagenesis on the selected P4. We substituted specific amino acids with alanine, which has an inert methyl functional side chain group that does not change the main conformation of the peptide, and thereby we removed the functional groups to create mutants with different surface physicochemical characteristics. We investigated the effect of net charge, hydrophobicity, and order of the amino acid sequence on diffusive transport through the tumor ECM using the aforementioned microchannel diffusion assay.The P4 sequence has one basic amino acid, and the remaining residues are polar amino acids. To alter the net charge, we mutated the basic and acidic positions to alanine to create negative (-1) and positive (+1) charge modifications, respectively ( Table 2a) .

The original neutral clone exhibits approximately 1.5-fold higher effective diffusivity compared to the positive and negative modifications (Figure 4a) . As a result of the alanine mutations, the hydrophobicity of the sequences has also been changed due to the removal of the polar acidic and basic amino acid residues. A similar decrease in hydrophilicity was also observed during library screening, where highly positive and negative charged peptides (with polar basic and acidic residues) were filtered out with increased rounds (Figures S1a and S1b).Next, we determined the role of hydrophobicity on transport of our selected peptide through the ECM. We modified the hydrophobicity of the original sequence through alanine mutagenesis of some or all of the polar amino acids, as indicated in Table 2b . In one of the modifications, we designed a peptide that is neither hydrophilic nor hydrophobic, which we termed hydro-neutral. We also generated a hydrophobic sequence where all of the polar amino acids were substituted with alanine. These modifications retained the same net charge of the original sequence while altering the hydrophobicity ( Table 2b) . The original hydrophilic clone demonstrated 2fold and 1.5-fold higher diffusivity than the hydro-neutral and hydrophobic clones, respectively ( Figure 4b) . This result is similar to reports where hydrophilic PEG coatings on hydrophobic polystyrene and poly(lactic-co-glycolic) nanoparticles improved their diffusivity through brain 41 and breast 39 tumor microenvironments. Hydrophobic surfaces of particles can strongly bind to the ECM 41 , and hydrophilic coatings minimize adhesion.Next, we made alterations to the order of the amino acid sequence to understand how changing the spatial order of the physicochemical properties affects diffusive transport through the tumor ECM. We made two modifications-(1) interchange the position of the basic and the acidic All rights reserved.

The net charge and hydrophobicity of the mutant sequences remain the same as the original sequence. From diffusion assays, the original selected sequence exhibits three-fold and two-fold higher effective diffusivity compared to the interchanged and adjacent mutants, respectively (Figure 4c) . This result suggests that the order of the amino acid sequence significantly impacts the diffusivity through the tumor-like ECM. Others have previously shown that modifying the spatial configuration of charge modulates the transport of peptides through a mucin hydrogel 63

We measured and quantified ex vivo uptake of our peptide-presenting phage in ECM-rich BxPC3 pancreatic tumor xenografts 79 as described by Bajpayee et al. 80 . Briefly, the BxPC3 tumor tissue slices were preequilibrated in PBS with protease inhibitor and incubated with in a bath of sample, P4 or control-phage. We calculated the clone uptake ratio in the tissue by quantifying the amount of phage in the tissue to the amount in the incubation bath over several days. The average uptake of selected clone P4-phage dramatically increased from 1.67×10 3 ±2.08×10 3 after 1 day to 1.34×10 8 ±2.31×10 8 after 5 days of the incubation, whereas the tumor uptake of the negative control-phage only increased from 1.12×10 3 ±4.94×10 2 in 1 day to 7.27×10 5 ±1.32×10 5 in 5 days ( Figure 5) . Consequently, the uptake ratio of P4-phage is 200 times higher than that of the negative control-phage after five days of incubation with the ex vivo tumor tissue. At initial timepoints, the rate of uptake is similar for both clones, but at later timepoints, there is a larger concentration gradient for our selected clone. This gradient allows continued diffusion and further transport of the P4-phage into the tumor tissue than observed with the control-phage. The difference in concentration gradients resulting in improved tissue uptake has been observed in cartilage explants [80] [81] [82] and mucus hydrogels 63 .All rights reserved.

Improved transport of nanoparticles in tumor tissue with peptide coatings.

While we have demonstrated that P4 peptide facilitates and improves transport of phage (P4-phage) through the tumors, we wanted to translate peptides from the structural context of phage and demonstrate their ability as surface coatings to improve diffusive transport of synthetic nanoparticles through the tumor microenvironment towards improving drug delivery. Here, fluorescent nanoparticles were conjugated with our selected peptide or gold standard controls from literature, and their displacement in tumors was tracked and measured using particle tracking microscopy.We compared the penetration of P4-coated nanoparticle through the tumor ECM with two functionalized controls that have been previously used to improve the penetration and/or uptake of nanoparticles. iRGD peptide (CRGDKGPDC), which is a cysteine constrained 9-mer peptide sequence identified by phage display, has been extensively demonstrated to improve solid tumor penetration 59 . In addition, low molecular weight PEG surface modification of nanoparticles has been shown to improve their diffusivity through various biological barriers including mucus 83

We conjugated the peptides and PEG coatings to fluorescent carboxylate nanoparticles via standard EDC bioconjugation chemistry. We selected PEG 1 kDa to match with the size of the peptide used in this work. As a result, the size and surface properties of all the particles are similar ( Table 3) , and therefore any change in the diffusivity of the particles is due to their interactions with the tumor tissue.

Characterization of the PEG/peptide coated nanoparticle formulations.We performed multiple particle tracking to measure the displacement of the surface modified nanoparticles through ex vivo BxPC3 tumor tissue xenografts (Script S1).

Both PEGylation and iRGD-coating improved the MSD of the nanoparticle 10-and 15-fold, respectively (Figure 6b) . This improvement is most likely due to their hydrophilic and less negative surface charge properties. Interestingly, the P4-peptide coating improved the MSD of the nanoparticle 40-fold, exhibiting greater improvement than the other coatings. Examining the individual particle diffusivity binned together as ensemble measurements through the tumor ECM, there is a shift in particle distribution towards higher MSD upon PEG or P4-peptide coating (Figures 6c and 6d) . In particular, there is a larger fraction of peptide-coated nanoparticles that are mobile and demonstrate rapid diffusivity (log MSD is greater than -0.5) compared to PEG-coated nanoparticles (5% to 1%, respectively). Given that the same molar ratio was used to conjugate peptide/PEG onto nanoparticles, this result suggests that the optimal peptide coating improves unhindered particle transport through the tumor ECM.Next, we quantified the MSD of the uncoated particle through PBS using particle tracking (Script S1 and Figure S4 ) and used these measurements to understand how the tumor ECM hinders nanoparticle transport ( Table 3) . The ensemble-averaged MSD of the particles in tumor ECM was compared to the unhindered MSD of the uncoated bead through PBS after 1 sec time lag ( Table 3) . There was a ~2000-fold decrease in the MSD of the uncoated nanoparticle through the tumor, whereas peptide and PEG-coatings reduced the hindrance of nanoparticle transport through the tumor tissue. P4 surface-coating most effectively reduced hindered transport, with only a ~57-fold decrease in transport in tumor relative to unhindered transport in PBS.All rights reserved.

Conclusion:

From combinatorial screening of a peptide-presenting phage ""nanoparticle"" library, we identified peptides as surface chemistries that facilitate diffusive transport through the ECM in tumor microenvironments, which can be used to ultimately improve transport of nanomedicines.Taking advantage of the molecular diversity of peptide-presenting phage libraries and their physicochemical properties, we are able to screen, iterate, and select peptides that can overcome the selection barrier of the tumor ECM to achieve permeating transport. The use of next-generation DNA sequencing allows us to expand the sequence sample space of peptides that can be analyzed and tested for improved transport. From next-generation sequencing data and in silico analysis, we identified specific peptides and motif sequences that enhanced transport through the ECM barrier.Select peptide-presenting clones exhibit rapid transport, as evidenced by an significant increase in their tumor transport compared to the negative control. Through systematic mutagenesis of the model P4 peptide-presenting phage, we demonstrate that alterations of the physicochemical properties and the configuration of the peptide impacts transport. We hypothesize that the mutations change the binding affinity of the peptide with the ECM, thereby hindering their diffusion. The role of binding interactions and its impact on diffusion has been observed in peptide transport in mucus and cartilage; however, further studies are warranted to confirm this mechanism in the tumor microenvironment. The model peptide-presenting phage exhibited increased uptake in tumor tissue compared to the negative control. Importantly, peptides are promising as surface coatings to improve nanoparticle transport through the tumor microenvironment. Peptide coatings reduce the hindered transport of uncoated nanoparticles through the tumor ECM and demonstrate improved transport compared to gold standard polymeric coatings. Importantly, there is a greater fraction of nanoparticles that achieve rapid transport in tumor tissues with our peptide coating All rights reserved.

While additional studies are needed to study how molecular weight and density of peptide and PEG coatings affect diffusion through tumors and tumor-like environments, these findings highlight the potential of peptides as alternative coatings to improve diffusion and distribution of nanomedicines. Collectively, these results suggest that peptide-based libraries are an attractive technology that possess excellent molecular diversity from which new chemistries identified with desired functionalities to improve molecule transport and delivery through the barriers of diseases.

"Abstract

The 2015-2016 emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas, and recognition that ZIKV 15 infection during pregnancy can result in birth defects, revealed a need for small animal models to 16 study ZIKV pathogenic mechanisms and evaluate candidate vaccines and antivirals. Mice would 17 be an attractive system for such studies, but ZIKV replicates poorly in laboratory mice because it 18 fails to antagonize murine STAT2 and STING. To address this, most ZIKV pathogenesis studies 19 have used mice with impaired interferon signaling (e.g. Ifnar1 -/or treatment with IFNAR1-blocking 20 antibodies). However, using mice with severe defects in innate antiviral signaling confounds 21 studies of viral pathogenic mechanisms. Collaborative Cross (CC) mice have proven to be a 22valuable system for developing new mouse pathogenesis models for viral infections that are not 23 well modeled in conventional laboratory mouse lines. To test whether CC mice could provide an 24 immune-competent model for ZIKV pathogenesis, we infected CC lines with ZIKV and assessed 25 weight loss, viremia, and production of neutralizing antibodies. We tested 21 CC lines (CC001, 26 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

MR766 is the prototype ZIKV strain and has been passaged ~150 times through suckling 157 mouse brains, which could result in mouse-adaptive mutations (14-16). However, the MR766 158 variant used in these studies contains a 4 amino acid deletion ablating an N-linked glycosylation 159 site in the viral envelope protein, resulting in a virus that is less virulent in Ifnar1 -/mice compared 160to H/PF/2013 (2, 17).

Mice were weighed daily after infection, as weight loss is a 163 sign of ZIKV disease in immunocompromised mouse models and typically precedes lethality (2). 164In contrast to IFN-deficient mice (and similar to WT C57Bl/6J mice) (2), none of the CC lines 165 tested lost weight following infection with any ZIKV strain (Figure 1) . Indeed, most lines exhibited 166 modest weight gain over the 14 day experiment, and the rate of weight gain was no slower in 167 infected mice than in mock-infected controls. None of the mice exhibited disease signs consistent 168 with those observed in IFN-deficient mice (e.g. hunching, ruffled fur, paralysis, or encephalitis). 169 CC051 and CC059 share more genetic similarities than average pairs of CC mice, so phenotypes 170 that differ between these two lines may be especially easy to map by quantitative trait locus (QTL) 171 analysis. Because 5-week-old CC059 mice exhibited slightly slower weight gain after ZIKV 172 infection compared to mock-infected mice, whereas ZIKV infection had no effect on the rate of 173 weight gain in CC051 mice, we tested ZIKV infection in weanlings of these 2 lines. We reasoned 174 that because 3-week-old mice gain weight at a faster rate than 5-week-old mice, they may reveal 175 phenotypes that are not evident in 5-week-old mice. However, while we found that 3-week-old 176 mice indeed gained weight at a faster rate than 5-week-old mice, there was no difference in the 177 rate of weight gain in mice infected with ZIKV Dakar-MA compared to mock-infected, for either 178 CC051 or CC059 (Figure 2) . Altogether, these observations indicate that ZIKV does not induce 179 significant disease in any of the 13 CC lines tested. 180 181 All rights reserved.

Altogether, these results show that while some ZIKV replication does occur in 205 CC mice, the virus is cleared rapidly, consistent with the lack of disease signs observed in CC 206 mice.

Zika virus infection induces neutralizing antibodies in Collaborative Cross mice. Since 210

ZIKV produced only transient low-level viremia in CC mice, we tested whether this was sufficient 211 to elicit the production of neutralizing antibodies.

Mice offer significant advantages in terms of cost, scale, speed, 232 and genetic tractability, enabling mechanistic studies that are not feasible in non-human primate 233 models. A significant disadvantage of mouse models is that ZIKV replicates poorly in 234 immunocompetent mice and thus does not exhibit the tissue tropism and disease phenotypes 235 characteristic of human infection. Mice lacking type I IFN production or responses succumb to 236 ZIKV infection and exhibit broad tissue tropism, implying that the innate antiviral response is a 237 key barrier to ZIKV replication and pathogenesis in mice (2, 36). Mice lacking the IFN-αβ receptor 238 All rights reserved.

The restriction of ZIKV replication in mice 241 results in part from an inability of ZIKV NS5 to degrade murine STAT2 and therefore ZIKV cannot 242 inhibit IFN signaling in mice by the same mechanism used in human cells (5, 6). However, NS5-243 mediated antagonism restricts antiviral signaling only in infected cells whereas these responses 244 are sustained in uninfected cells responding to paracrine IFN signaling. Thus, Stat2 -/mice 245 succumb to ZIKV infection, but transgenic mice expressing human STAT2 only exhibit disease in 246 the context of ZIKV strains with additional mouse-adaptive mutations (4, 44). In addition, the ZIKV 247 NS2B-NS3 protease targets human but not murine STING, resulting in sustained IFN production 248and diminished viral replication in mouse cells (3). However, mice lacking STING were not more 249 susceptible to ZIKV than wild-type mice (2, 3), implying that STING is a contributing but not susceptibility defined in mice. Over 80 years ago, flavivirus resistance was shown to be inherited 254 in a single gene autosomal dominant manner (22, 45, 46) , and more than 15 years ago the 255 resistance phenotype was mapped to the Oas1b gene (47, 48). More recent studies used F1 256 hybrids of CC mice to define genetic determinants of WNV pathogenesis and found that the QTL 257 with the largest effect mapped to Oas1b (12, 49). The antiviral activity of Oas1b restricts all 258 flaviviruses (>13 viruses tested) and appears to act exclusively against flaviviruses. Other 259 members of the Oas gene family restrict viral replication by sensing dsRNA and synthesizing the 260 second messenger 2'-5' oligoadenylate, which activates the cytoplasmic RNA degrading enzyme 261RNaseL. However, Oas1b is not catalytically active and does not activate RNaseL (50). The 262 flavivirus restricting activity of Oas1b is cell intrinsic and restricts viral replication in a post-entry 263 manner, but its mechanism is unknown (50, 51).

Thus, we sought to determine whether CC 280 mice might provide a useful model system for ZIKV. We found that, although ZIKV viremia was 281 detectable at 1dpi, the amount of viral RNA detected in serum was very low and cleared rapidly, 282 and infected mice exhibited no signs of disease including weight loss. Based on these results, the 283 tested CC lines are unlikely to be useful as models of ZIKV disease or as tools to map host factors 284 that control ZIKV pathogenesis. This was true even of CC lines carrying non-functional alleles of 285Oas1b, which would be expected to be the most susceptible to flavivirus infection (12). 286 287 It is possible that additional approaches could reveal experimentally useful ZIKV phenotypes in 288 CC mice. These could include administering virus by an intravenous, rather than subcutaneous 289 route, or infecting with a higher dose of virus, although the 1x10 5 FFU dose we used for infections 290 All rights reserved.

Another approach would be administering an IFNAR-blocking 291 monoclonal antibody (MAR1-5A3) prior to ZIKV infection. In C57Bl/6J mice, MAR1-5A3 treatment 292 results in elevated viremia and relevant clinical phenotypes such as transplacental transmission, 293 though it is not sufficient to produce weight loss or lethality.

"Abstract

Based on publicly released data for 1212 patients, we investigated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan of China. The following findings are obtained: 1) COVID-19 patients in Henan show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences, possible causes were explored; 2) Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days; Incubation periods of 92% patients were no more than 14 days; 3) The epidemic of COVID-19 in Henan has undergone three stages and showed high correlations with the numbers of patients that recently return from Wuhan; 4) Network analysis on the aggregate outbreak phenomena of COVID-19 revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected, and various people's Hospital are the main force in treating patients. The related investigations have potential implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.

","Introduction

Arising from Wuhan South China seafood market at the end of the year 2019, novel coronavirus pneumonia (Named as COVID-19 by WHO since February 11, 2020) has spread for more than one months, and it has directly resulted to more than 74600 confirmed patients, and 2121 people dead till February 20, 2020 [1] - [19] . Various investigations and reports reveal that the COVID-19 is different from the SARS in the year 2003 from the following aspects [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] : 1) Higher Infection rate; 2) With incubation period; 3) Incubation period is infectious; 4) Low lethality rate; 5) High mortality among the elderly patients that are with underlying diseases. These features result the prevention and control of COVID-19 to be a difficult task.As a double-side sword, modern traffic and communication technologies greatly shortage the distances among people and provide convenience for human beings, however, they also facilitate the rapidly and widely spreading of epidemic diseases or rumors [12] . Since January 23, Wuhan has taken strict measures to close the city, and many other places have adopted various measures in succession to prevent the spreading of COVID-19, such as blocking traffic and putting suspicious ones in quarantine. After the outbreak of COVID-19, researchers have paid great efforts on the investigations of COVID-19, including its control and prediction [1] - [18] . Initial investigations pointed out that bats are mostly the source of the virus [3] , and Manis pentadactyla is a potential intermediate host of . The related investigations have great implications on the prevention, control and vaccine development [20] - [30] . Some recent publications have reported the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . To prevent the spreading of COVID-19, the centers for disease control and prevention (CDCs) of many provinces have timely released the data of confirmed cases, which facilitate us to explore the epidemiological and statistical characteristics of patients with COVID-19, and to understand the current situation and characteristics of the epidemic.As a neighbor of the Hubei province, Henan province is with a large population size, and it is also one of the hardest hit areas of the epidemic. The current total confirmed cases in Henan are only lower than Hubei and Guangdong. The statistical analysis on the patients data in Henan can help us to understand the epidemiological and clinical features of patients [17] . In this paper, based on data collected from CDCs at all levels in Henan, we will perform statistical analysis. Our data includes 1212 patients ranging from January 21 to February 14, 2020, and covering 18 regions of Henan province. We will try to answer the following questions: 1) the current situation and characteristics of the epidemic in the 18 regions of Henan; 2) The sex and age distributions of confirmed cases; 3) The estimation of incubation period of patients with COVID-19; 4) The correlation between the number of patients with Wuhan travel histories and the total number of confirmed cases; 5) Network analysis on aggregate outbreak phenomena. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will introduce our main results and methods; Sections 3 gives some discussions and conclusions of the paper.

The current epidemic situations and characteristics in Henan

From January 21 to February 14, 2020, totally 1212 confirmed cases have been released in Henan. The epidemic situation, time evolution of daily increased infected patients and cumulatively confirmed ones are shown in Fig.1 .Based on Fig.1 , we see that the daily increment of patients reaches a peak value of 109 at February 3, 2020. After that, the daily increment of patients significantly decreases. Among the 18 regions of Henan province, Xinyang, Nanyang, Zhumadian, Zhengzhou, Shangqiu and Zhoukou encompass more confirmed cases than the other regions. Xinyang is still with the highest daily increment as compared with the other regions, which is the severely affected area in Henan. In fact, Xinyang, Nanyang and Zhumadian are all near Hubei-the worst affected province in China. It was reported that about five million people have left Wuhan since January 23. According to the investigation from Xu et al. [7, 8] , before Wuhan was closed at January 23, Xinyang, Zhengzhou, Nanyang, Zhumadian, Zhoukou, Shangqiu were ranked among the top-50 cities in China that received huge amount of Wuhan personnel. The number of virus carrier is supposed to be proportional to the received amount of Wuhan personnel, which may be one of the main reasons that why the mentioned regions in Henan are so severely affected.

Gender and age distribution

Among the 1212 patients, we abstract the gender information of 1158 patients (95.54% of total samples) and the age information of 1156 patients (95.38% of total samples). From the perspective of both the whole province and its 18 regions, we performed detailed statistical analysis, which are summarized in Fig.2 .Statistical results reveal that 637 out of the 1158 patients are male, which accounts for 55% and apparently higher than females (Fig.2 A) , although there are slightly differences among different regions . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .

We guess that there are three possible reasons that may result to such gender difference. Firstly, males may be more active and with wider social activities than females, which increases their risk to infect COVID-19. Secondly and may be the most reasonable, an existing medical investigation reported that the expression and distribution of angiotension converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was wider in male patients than those in females [5] . Similarly to SARS-CoV, it is reported that COVID-19 invades human body through the ACE2 receptor. Based on single cell RNA sequencing technology, researchers have investigated the expression profiles of ACE2 in two male and six female patients with COVID-19 from single cell resolution, and they found that the expression of ACE2 was correlated with gender. The proportion of ACE2 expressed cells is higher in males than in females (1.66% vs. 0.41%) [5] . Besides, the distribution of ACE2 was also wider in males than that in females. Zhao et al. [5] reported that there were at least five different types of cells in the lungs of males with the expression of the ACE2 receptors, while the number was about 2 ∼ 4 in female patients. This may be one of the deep reasons that why male patients were higher than the female ones. Thirdly, one may doubt that the distribution difference may be caused by population structure. To verify whether the male to female ratio (MFR) affects the finding, based on the statistical yearbook report of Henan province in the year 2019, the MFR in the whole province was 1.0126 : 1, which has great difference with the male to female patients ratio (MFPR) (637 : 521 = 1.2226 : 1). Moreover, we perform correlation analysis for the two ratios in the 18 regions, the two ratios show very weak correlation, with Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.1555 ( Fig.2 C) . Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test [31] on the MFR and MFPR in the 18 regions also shows that the two have significant difference (KS = 0.6111, p = 0.0018 < 0.05). Thus, we speculate that the MFR has no apparent effect on the MFPR. In conclusion, the former two reasons may be the driven force that there was gender difference in confirmed patients.The age distribution of patients in the whole province or each region all roughly follows normal distribution ( Fig.2 D, E). Patients aged between 21 and 60 years old take up more than 81% (938 out of 1156). The main reason may be that people aged between 21 and 60 years old are the social main labor forces, there are many migrant workers in this age interval. Moreover, they may have wider social circles than the others. Therefore, people aged between 21 and 60 years old are key crowd with high risks of COVID-19.

Definition of incubation period and statistical results

Traditionally, incubation period is defined as the period between the infection of an individual by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness or disease it causes [32, 33] . Different infectious diseases have different incubation periods. However, for a certain infectious disease, its incubation period is relatively fixed. Since the number of pathogens entering the body, virulence and reproductive capacity, as well as power of resistance are different for different people, thus, it is reported that the incubation periods obtained from patients for a certain disease should follow logarithm normal distribution [16, 33] . Generally, incubation period can be measured by physiological observations and biological experiments [33] . The determination of incubation period has great implications for disease transmission control and policy making.The estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19 is a very difficult task. The main difficulty is in that it is difficult to determine the infected time. Based on patients' information, some works have reported the incubation period of COVID-19. For example, Yang et al. [4] reported that the median incubation period of COVID-19 is 4.75 days; the interquartile range is 3.0 − 7.2 days. Hereinafter, we try to estimate the incubation period of patients in Henan. The collected data are with varied quality, many descriptions of patients only told us when the person left Wuhan, or When she/he had suspicious contacts with persons from Wuhan or suspicious persons (Following, we call they are exposed). To facilitate us to estimate the incubation period, we define estimated incubation period as the period from the date of exposure to the date of appearing clinical symptoms or making a definite diagnosis. Apparently, such definition overestimates the actual incubation period. For example, the information from a patient .

Edges represent the transfer from the two dates, and thicknesses of edges are proportional to the numbers of patients. Self-loops mean that the dates for exposure and appearing clinical symptoms or confirmed infected were the same. D. Weighted indegree and outdegree distributions of the directed graph that was shown in C. Weighted indegree denotes the total number of patients with clinical symptoms or confirmed infected; while weighted outdegree represents the total number of exposed persons that will be confirmed to be infected later.(Mr Zhou, No.2 patients in Nanyang) in Nanyang says that his son left Wuhan and arrived at home at January 6, he and his son were all disease-free for a long period. Until February 3, he became sick and was quickly confirmed with infection of COVID-19. His son was disease-free till now. From our definition of incubation period, his incubation period will be 28 days, which is surprisingly high. We note that, our definition of estimated incubation period may be a little higher than the actually case, since we can not exclude the cases that the person has contacted some other people that carried the COVID-19. That is, we cannot know who was the intermediate spreader (unknown person B), and when she/he transmitted the virus from person A to person C.Among the collected data, the incubation periods of 483 confirmed patients can be estimated. Statistical results are shown in Fig.3 and Tab.1. The estimated incubation periods for the 483 patients roughly follow the logarithm normal distribution, with a long right tail. Specifically, the 483 confirmed patients were with average estimated incubation periodτ D = 7.4 days, the mode was 4 days (50 out of the 483 cases) and the median was 7 days (48 out of the 483 cases). About 55% patients were with incubation periods lower than 7 days, while more than 92% patients were lower than 14 days. About 7.45% patients were overestimated with more than 14 days incubation periods.Due to the definition, the estimated incubation periods in this paper may be longer than the real cases. However, the distribution has some implications. It indicates that a few patients may be with very long incubation period, which increase the difficulty to control and prevent the COVID-19..

Statistical results of estimated as well as fitted incubation period (Fig.3 A) 

Modeling the distribution of the incubation period

To theoretically model the incubation period, we suppose the incubation period τ follows the logarithm normal distribution [16, 33] :That is, the probability density function (PDF) of τ can be written asHere, µ, σ 2 are two parameters that can be estimated from data. We consider three different approaches to estimate the parameters µ and σ 2 , including the moment estimation (ME), the ordinary least square (OLS) estimation and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) [34] . As to the ME, based on the PDF of incubation period τ , we can easily obtain E(τ ) = exp µ + σ 2 /2 , D(τ ) = (e σ 2 − 1)exp 2µ + σ 2 . Using the fsolve function (which is based on the OLS method) in Matlab, we obtainμ m = 1.8239, σ 2 m = 0.3629. The fitted PDF curve can be found in Fig.3 A, and some theoretical estimations of the incubation period based on the ME method are summarized in Tab.1.Similarly, for the OLS estimation, µ and σ 2 can be estimated from the following optimization objective function:Here, p i = n i /n denotes the ratio of patients with incubation period i(i = 0, 1, ..., m) (totally m+1 unique incubation periods), which can be easily computed from the 483 patients (n=483). f (t i ) corresponds to the PDF with incubation period t i , which is a function of the unknown parameters µ and σ 2 . Since τ = 0 in Eq.(2.2), we omit the case τ = 0 (only 29 cases were with τ = 0). By solving the optimization problem (2.5), we obtainμ o = 2.0723, σ 2 o = 0.5929. For the MLE, the estimation of µ and σ 2 can be obtained from minimizing the following negative logarithmic likelihood function..

Similarly to OLS, the case with τ = 0 will be not considered. Finally, we obtainThe fitted curves from the three methods are shown in Fig.3 A. Comparing among the three methods, it seems that the fitted curve from the ME method has the smallest variance, the variances of the OLS and MLE approaches are both very high. High variance indicates higher proportions of patients with long incubation periods. The ME method may well mimic the actual long right tail of the incubation period, while the OLS estimation could well describe the cases with middle incubation periods (incubation periods 2 ∼ 14). The MLE approach seems in between the ME and OLS approaches. The estimated interquartile range from the ME method is [4.1495, 9.3523] , which closes to the result from the 483 patients ( [4, 11] ).The theoretical modeling of incubation period further illustrates that the incubation period may follow the logarithmic normal distribution. Moreover, it can be used to estimate the actual statics of incubation periods, and provide valuable references for decision-making.

Transfer diagram from exposure to infection

The epidemic of COVID-19 in Henan has undergone three stages (Fig.3 C and D) . For the first stage that before January 13, both exposed and confirmed patients were not so much, the number of exposed (outdegree) ones were more than the confirmed ones (indegree). While for the second stage that between January 13 and January 23, the COVID-19 was in outbreak period, both exposed and confirmed ones were considerable, and the number of exposed ones are far more than the confirmed ones. During this period, many college students and migrant workers in Wuhan return their hometown, the large number of people flow from Wuhan increased the risks of exposure and infection. After January 23, the epidemic entered the third stage, the number of daily confirmed cases were apparently higher than exposed ones, and the confirmed cases roughly decreased with time. This may be attributed to the adoption of prevention and control measures. With the closing of the Wuhan city at January 23, many regions of Henan quickly adopt very strict measures to prevent the spreading of COVID-19. Thus, after January 23, the number of exposed ones became fewer and fewer (Fig.3 D) , which is a good phenomena, indicating that the prevention and control measures become to gradually at work.

Correlation with Wuhan travel histories

For the 18 regions of Henan province, we also summarized the numbers of currently confirmed patients with Wuhan travel histories (denoted as vector X 1 ), the numbers of patients without Wuhan travel histories (X 2 ), the numbers of patients that have contacts with persons from Wuhan (X 3 ), as well as the numbers of patients that are without Wuhan travel histories, but who have contacts with suspicious persons (X 4 ). The barplots for the numbers of the four categories of patients in the 18 regions are shown in Fig.4 A (In total of 1149 patients were known with or without Wuhan travel histories). Among patients with Wuhan travel histories, the released information of 250 patients contained transportation information. We found that 46% of the 250 patients have recently traveled by train or by bus, these patients may transmit the COVID-19 to a lot of people that in the same train or bus.For the 18 regions, we investigate the correlation between the currently total numbers of confirmed patients (Y ) with X 1 − X 4 respectively. The heatmap of the correlation matrix is shown in Fig.4C . It reveals that Y has the highest correlation with X 1 , the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two is 0.9643, the fitted regression equation [35] is Y = 1.8146X 1 + 9.0920.(2.8)Such linear relationship statistically holds (F = 212.31, p < 0.0001, R 2 = 0.9299). However, though there are certain correlation between Y and X 2 − X 4 , their strength of correlations are all lower than .

This indicates that persons with Wuhan travel histories have high risks of infection with COVID-19, and regions with more such persons tend to encompass more patients infected with COVID-19.

Network analysis on aggregate outbreak phenomena

From the 1212 patients, we constructed a heterogeneous network and performed some analysis on such network (Fig.5 ). The network contains 1105 patients that have been treated in 248 hospitals, 123 interhospital transfer relationships that involved 206 patients, and 208 patients that were clustering infected. Nodes in the network include patients and hospitals. Edges among patients represent relationship between relatives, friends or colleagues; Edges between patients and hospitals denote the patients were treated in the related hospitals; while edges among hospitals indicate the inter-hospital transfer treatments. Sizes of nodes were proportional to nodes' degree. Thickness of edges was proportional to the numbers of patients. From Fig.5 , we see that a few hospitals encompass a large number of patients in treatments, and the aggregate outbreak phenomena were ubiquitous. For example, the five patients that are treated in Zhengzhou Jinshui General Hospital are relatives to each other, they were successively infected. Similarly, 12 patients in Kaifeng are also relatives to each other. In fact, totally 208 patients were clustering infected, and Zhengzhou, Shangqiu, Zhoukou, Xuchang and Luoyang encompassed the most aggregative outbreak patients. Among the designated hospitals in Henan province, people's hospitals in different cities encompass a great number of patients. Xinyang Fifth People's Hospital received the most patients in Henan, followed by the Zhengzhou Sixth People's Hospital and the Luoshan County People's Hospital. Network analysis can provide us important information about patients, hospitals and their relationships; it can also provide valuable guidance for the distribution of epidemic prevention materials.

Discussions and conclusions

Through collection of publicly released patients information by various CDCs in Henan province during January 21 to February 14 of 2020, we performed statistical analysis on 1212 confirmed patients infected with COVID-19. The number of newly confirmed cases reached its peak at February 3, and it started .

Among the 18 regions of Henan, Xinyang is with the heaviest epidemic, and it is currently also with the highest daily increment. We found that 55% patients in Henan were male, which is apparently higher than the females. We found that the gender difference of patients in Henan is 1.2226 : 1, while from Yang et al. [4] , they reported that the gender difference for 4021 patients from over 30 provinces is 0.31 : 0.27 = 1.1481 : 1. Our result is close to the existing ones. We reported that the MFRs of the whole province and its 18 regions are not the main factor that results to the gender difference in patients. Two possible main factors that result to such gender difference of patients include 1) the expression and distribution of ACE2s were wider in male patients than those in females, and 2) males are more active and with wider social activities than females in many regions of Henan. The ages of patients generally follow normal distribution, and with more than 81% patients are aged between 21 and 60 years old. N a n y a n g C e n tr a l H o s p . Incubation period is very important but very difficult to be estimated, since it is difficult to know when the patients were infected. We define the period from firstly contacting with suspicious persons or recently return from Wuhan to firstly appearing clinical symptoms (fever, cough etc) as incubation period, and we estimate its distribution. Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the average estimated incubation period was 7.4 days, the mode was 4 days. About 55% patients were with incubation periods lower than 7 days, while more than 92% patients were lower than 14 days. About 7.45% patients were overestimated with more than 14 days incubation periods. Based on ME, OLS and MLE approaches, we modeled the incubation period as logarithmic normal distributions, and we found the ME method can well mimic the long right tails of the PDF for the incubation periods. Based on the ME approach, interquartile range of theoretically estimated incubation period is between 4.1 and 9.4 days. It is noted that, due to .

"Abstract

Governments around the world are implementing population-wide physical distancing measures in an effort to control transmission of COVID-19, but metrics to evaluate their effectiveness are not readily available. We used a publicly available mobility index based on the relative frequency of trips planned in a popular transit application to evaluate the effect of physical distancing on infection growth rates and reproductive number in 34 states and countries. We found that a 10% decrease in relative mobility in the 2 nd week of March was associated with a 11.8% relative decrease (exp(β) = 0.882; 95% CI: 0.822, 0.946) in the average daily growth rate in the fourth week of March and a change in the instantaneous reproductive number of -0.054 (95% CI: 0.097, -0.011) in the same period. Our analysis demonstrates that decreases in urban mobility were predictive of declines in epidemic growth at national or subnational scales. Mobility metrics offer an appealing method to calibrate population-level physical distancing policy and implementation.

","Introduction

Policies limiting contact between individuals outside of households, via school closure, voluntary telecommuting, and shelter-at-home orders, have been implemented in a growing number of regions to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. These physical distancing (previously termed social distancing) policies have helped control previous epidemics (1) and played a significant role in reducing COVID-19 transmission in China (2, 3) . Many regions have since adopted physical distancing measures, incrementally increasing restrictions and enforcement over time. However, public health officials have not had access to measures indicating whether current interventions are sufficient for reducing transmission. A proximal indicator of future infection rates (at a known temporal lag) is urgently needed to guide the further implementation of physical distancing measures. In this analysis, we demonstrate that a mobility index based on regular users of a web-based transit application is able to capture the effect of physical distancing on the reproductive number and growth rate of COVID-19 in 34 states and countries spanning 4 continents.

Mobility Index

We used a daily city-level mobility index to (a) measure adherence to large-scale movement restrictions, and (b) predict COVID-19 growth rate and instantaneous reproductive number at the national or subnational level. The mobility index was provided by a public transit application (app) and uses the number of trips planned on the app to estimate the percentage of each city that is commuting relative to an internal reference from a recent usage period. The index is available from March 2 nd to present and includes all 41 cities where the app operates. Importantly, outbreaks in major urban centers (like those in our dataset) represent a large proportion of total COVID-19 cases at national and sub-national (regional) levels (4) . As a result, reduced mobility in these cities should have a significant impact on infection growth rates at larger geographies. Furthermore, changes in the city-level mobility index are related to physical distancing interventions, many of which were implemented at the national or subnational level (5); thus, reduced mobility in major urban centers should serve as a reasonable proxy for larger-scale behavior change.All cities experienced substantial reduction in mobility during March (Fig. 1) . Cities within Europe, Australia, and the Americas showed strikingly similar patterns in mobility reduction that corresponded to the dates of national or sub-national physical distancing mandates, including restrictions on public gatherings or mandatory closures. Prior to the implementation of the first major physical distancing policy, the mobility index was declining by an average of 1.84% per day (95% CI: 1.53, 2.16); after implementation, the rate of decrease was 3.94% per day (slope change of 2.10%; 95% CI: 1.84, 2.36) (Fig. 1) . Increasingly restrictive physical distancing policies were adopted in an incremental fashion following the index date and thus continued declines in mobility were expected through the remainder of the month. Messaging from public health authorities and news media likely contributed to changes in behavior prior to the index date.The Citymapper Mobility Index (CMI; https://citymapper.com/cmi) includes data on 41 cities from 23 countries. CMI measures the relative frequency of trips planned within 41 cities across the Americas, Europe, Australia and Asia, compared to an internal reference at the beginning of 2020. We excluded the four Asian cities from all analyses since, at the time of writing, it was unclear if their reference periods included January 2020, at which time many cities in Asia were likely to have already experienced changes in mobility patterns. The CMI is available from March 2 nd to present.All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 3.6.3) (9). To validate our use of CMI as a measurement for adherence to physical distancing measures, we used a linear mixed effect model with a random intercept for city. We defined a continuous covariate for days since March 2 nd (time) and a binary term denoting the first announcement of major national or sub-national physical distancing interventions, namely gathering restrictions and/or mandatory closures (1 = date follows announcement of physical distancing measure) (Table S1 ). Unlike a declaration of emergency, these measures have clear and consistent implications across regions. We included terms for time and the interaction between time and the binary variable for physical distancing to estimate the change in slope for the daily decline in CMI resulting from the announcement of physical distancing measures.In subsequent analyses, population weighted CMI (based on metro area population) was calculated when mobility data was available for two or more cities in a given region (e.g., California) or country (e.g., Russia) but more granular case data were not available.

COVID-19 Case Growth Rates

Most cities implemented their first major physical distancing policies throughout the second week of March (March 9 th to March 15 th ). Assuming that, throughout March, the average time from initial infection to being reported as a case was approximately 10-20 days, we would expect changes in mobility in the second week of March to be reflected in case data from the fourth week of March.The mean mobility index in the second week of March (March 9 th to March 15 th ) was associated with the logarithm of the growth rate of cumulative cases in the fourth week of March (March 23 rd to March 29 th ) (Fig. 2) . A 10% lower mean mobility index in the second week was associated with a 11.8% lower mean daily growth rate in the fourth week (exp(β) = 0.882; 95% CI: 0.822, 0.946). To ensure results were not unduly influenced by the early onset of the Italian epidemic (with concomitant lower mobility in early March), we removed these regions and found that the relationship remained (exp(β) = 0.870; 95% CI: 0.787, 0.962). Our findings are also robust to estimation of median daily growth rate (exp(β) = 0.875; 95% CI: 0.822, 0.932). When the model is adjusted for days since the 100 th case (a measure of epidemic timing), the association is attenuated (exp(β) = 0.930; 95% CI: 0.851, 1.015). However, these two variables are highly correlated, as physical distancing measures are rarely implemented prior to significant case growth (Spearman's ρ = -0.66). The mobility index in the first week of March (March 2 nd to March 8 th ) showed a similar strength of association to outcomes in the fourth week, whereas the mobility index in the third week of March (March 16 th to March 22 nd ) showed a much weaker association ( Table 1) .We obtained national and sub-national (where available) cumulative case time series for countries represented in the Citymapper data (Table S2 ). In all, we obtained 34 regional-and national-level cumulative case time series. We calculated daily growth rates for each region (presented as a percentage) by dividing the number of new cases reported in a given day by the cumulative number of cases as of the previous day.We used a mixed effects model with a random intercept for country (to account for clustering of subnational units within a country) to estimate the association between mean CMI and the logarithm of the mean daily growth rate in prior weeks. Based on the known lag between infection and symptom onset of 5 days (10), plus an estimated lag between symptom onset and public reporting of 5 to 15 days, we use 2-week lag as our primary analysis and use 1-and 3-week lags as sensitivity analyses. To adjust for epidemic timing (e.g., sub-exponential growth that could occur due to the host contact network, behavioral changes and inhomogeneous mixing (11)), we ran an additional model including days since the 100 th case as a continuous covariate (excluding the Principality of Monaco, which had fewer than 50 cases by the end of week 4). However, we note that epidemic timing is strongly correlated with mean CMI in week 2. For example, Italy, which had an earlier epidemic than other European countries, had a substantially lower CMI in early March than other European countries in the dataset.

COVID-19 Reproductive Number

The mobility index in the second week of March was associated with the estimated instantaneous reproductive number in the fourth week of March (Fig. 3) . A 10% lower mean mobility index in the second week was associated with a decrease in the instantaneous reproductive number of 0.054 in the fourth week (β = -0.054; 95% CI: -0.097, -0.011). The point estimate remained similar if Italian regions were removed (-0.058; 95% CI: -0.120, 0.004). When the model is adjusted for days since the 100 th case, the association is attenuated (β = -0.031; 95% CI: -0.085, 0.024).The instantaneous reproductive number is a quantity signifying the average number of secondary infections a person infected at time t would be expected to generate given that conditions remain unchanged (12) . We estimated the instantaneous reproductive number in week 4 using the EpiEstim .

We employed the parametric serial interval method (14) using parameters from Du et al. (15) (mean = 3.96 days, SD = 4.75 days). As data on case origins were not available in most sources, we did not adjust for imported cases in our calculations.We used a linear mixed effects model with a random intercept for country to estimate the association between mean CMI in week 2 and the estimated instantaneous reproductive number in week 4. To adjust for epidemic timing, we ran an additional model including days since the 100 th case as a continuous covariate (excluding the Principality of Monaco, which had fewer than 50 cases at the end of week 4).

Discussion

We found that a mobility index of public transit users in cities spanning 4 continents predicted growth in reported cases of COVID-19 two to three weeks later. Such an index could be used by public health and governments attempting to understand the impacts of physical distancing and mobility restriction measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.While the metric we evaluated is predictive, its availability is limited to a handful of cities located mainly in Europe and North America. The index also reflects the movement of a limited portion of the population-transit users-and provides no insight into the number and distribution of close contacts that could lead to transmission. Although we have justified the use of a city-level mobility metric above, this inevitably introduces measurement error for an outcome aggregated at the national or sub-national level. Variation across countries and regions in the delay between symptom onset and public reporting of cases adds uncertainty regarding the correct lag between changes in mobility and the expected effects on growth rates. This should become less of an issue as more rapid and standardized testing is implemented across regions.Our study had other limitations. Our analysis does not confirm a causal pathway through mobility, but rather a strong association that warrants further evaluation. For example, it is possible that those countries that most successfully enforce physical distancing are also more successful at implementing interventions such as contact tracing or widespread testing, which may also contribute to the observed association. We also did not account for imported cases in the calculation of the instantaneous reproductive number; however, locally acquired cases were certainly undercounted during this period, and likely to a greater degree than imported cases due to the increased attention on international travelers..

Recently published publicly available mobility data may contain a greater variety of contact and mobility patterns, but are restricted in breadth and data access (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). We call for all organizations with access to mobility data to publicly release them. These metrics need not be granular, as physical distancing measures can be implemented at a broad scale. Further evaluation of the utility of these metrics in guiding population interventions are needed, particularly for illuminating the steps necessary to keep the reproductive number of the disease below 1.Though necessary, these strategies are already proving to have dire consequences on other aspects of health and well-being (6, 7) . The value of mobility metrics is set to increase dramatically as countries consider a transition toward intermittent or cyclical physical distancing measures that aim to minimize these negative externalities (8) . Finally, we hope our results will be helpful to reassure the public that, despite the immense economic, social and psychological costs, their continued cooperation will have powerful long-term benefits..

"Abstract

The ongoing new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak is spreading in China and has not reached its peak. Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak.The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020.Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number.The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number..

","Introduction

Emerging infectious diseases are still great challenges in the 21st century. In recent years, worldwide outbreaks of Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused great health and economic losses [1] [2] [3] . The reported 27 cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and many cases were related to the Wuhan Southern China Seafood Market, which was subsequently closed on January 1, 2020 4 . On January 7, 2020, laboratory test results showed that the pathogen of unexplained pneumonia was a new type of coronavirus, which was then officially named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) 5, 6 . The 2019-nCoV outbreak started in Wuhan, and then spread rapidly to other provinces and countries 7, 8 . As of January 30, 2020, a total of 34 provinces and regions in China have reported 9,692 cases. Nearly all imported cases were derived from Wuhan, Hubei province 9, 10 . The 2019-nCoV pneumonia was defined as a class B infectious disease but managed as class A infectious disease by the Chinese government. Daily case reports are being released and any omission or concealment is punishable by law. At present, the number of cases is still increasing and the epidemic has not yet reached its peak, but the situation differs by province. .Information about the temporal and spatial distributions of the cases is important for preparation of a targeted treatment and prevention strategy. Because the return peak of Spring Festival transport is coming, the information on possible changes in incidence in different cities will help us to prepare in advance. Therefore, we investigated the temporal and spatial distributions of the early epidemic to reveal the dynamic changes and trends.These results will provide valuable information for the disease prevention for both individuals and organizations.

Case data collection

All officially reported confirmed, suspected, severe cases and deaths of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected from the internet (website:). Case data were imported into Excel and incidence per 100,000 was calculated. No ethical approval is needed for this study.

Temporal and spatial distribution and risk analysis

The national and Hubei province shapefiles are used for ArcGIS analysis. The map is linked to Excel file with time and spatial information. The risk analysis of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia is based on the Bayesian space-time model of WinBUGS software 11, 12 . The model is divided into three levels:(1) Data model For the statistical data of low incidence, it is assumed to follow the Poisson distribution of the parameters ni and μit: yit ~ Poiss (niμit), where Hubei province yit is i (1,…., 16) cities at t (1,…, 11) the number of cases that occurred during the day. The nationwide yit is the number of cases that occurred in t (1,…, 11) days in i (1,…., 240) cities. We assume that there is no change in the number of people at risk in each city during the study period, where ni is the number of people at risk in the town (i), and μit is the corresponding disease risk in the city (t) per day (i).(2) Process model interaction. Relative to b0, it is the local change trend of each city based on b0; εit is used to explain local changes that cannot be explained by spatiotemporal random effects. 13 (3) Parametric modelAccording to the BYM model 14 , a spatial structure effect is defined by a prior conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure. In this process, a spatial adjacency weight matrix needs to be defined. The weight adjacency is wij=1, otherwise the weight wij=0, and the special wij=0.Similarly, b1i is also assumed to follow the BYM process. For the time structure effect υt, a .

The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02. 10.20021824 doi: medRxiv preprint conditional autoregressive process is used, and the adjacency weight matrix in time is defined.For the over-discrete parameter εit, according to Gelman, the normal distribution with a mean value of 0 and a variance of σ 2 ε, is generally assumed and the variance of each parameter obeys Gamma (a, b). 15 Based on this model, through the spatial component si and its posterior probability, high-risk or low-risk cities with respect to the average risk (α) of the entire study area can be identified. By calculating the probability of spatial relative risk, exp (si) is greater than 1 and divided into five categories: areas with probability> 0.8, 0.6-0.8, 0.4-0.6, 0.2-0.4, and <0.2 are defined as hot spots, secondary hot spots, warm-spots, sub-cold spots, and cold-spots respectively. Similarly, based on the probability threshold, the differences in these classification regions can be identified based on the trend over time. The probability that exp (b1i) is greater than 1 is divided into five categories: cities with an incidence risk probability greater than 0.8 have a rapid change trend relative to the overall risk change; between 0.6 and 0.8 indicate that the change trend of the incidence risk is greater than the overall risk change; 0.4 to 0.6 indicates that the occurrence risk is the same as the overall risk change trend; 0.2 to 0.4 indicates that the change trend of the disease risk is slower than the overall risk change; the change trend of the disease risk in cities with a probability less than 0.2 is more slower than the overall risk.The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02. 10.20021824 doi: medRxiv preprintThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02. 10.20021824 doi: medRxiv preprint to city level with ArcGIS. Of the 362 cities, 307 (84.8%) had reported cases. In general, the core outbreak area, Wuhan and its surrounding cities, had the highest number of cases, followed by cities with high population that are transportation hubs (Figure 2A ). Spatial distribution was then analyzed with a Bayesian model using WinBUGS 13, 14 . After iterating nearly 100,000 times, the model converged successfully. After the model converged, it iterated another 110,000 times to obtain parameter estimations. A ratio close to 1 indicates that the two chain iterative sequences are close, and that the model has a good convergence and is stable ( Figure 2B ). With the established model and parameters, hot and cold spots were identified.The results showed that Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan, and Taiwan were hot spots, and Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Chongqing, Hunan, and Guangxi were secondary hot spots. Generally, hot spots clustered in the Midwest and cold spots clustered in the Southeast ( Figure 2D ).The overall temporal trend was calculated using the time risk model (exp(b0t*+vt)), which described the general incidence risk by time during the period from January 16 to January 30, 2020. The results showed that b0 is estimated to be 0.4604, that is, the disease risk on the following day is approximately 1.585 times higher than the previous day. The relative risk by time increased steadily from January 20 and remained in an upward trend as of January 30 ( Figure 2C ). From this, it can be estimated that the number of cases nationwide is on the rise. Figure 2E , Heilongjiang, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Jiangsu, Hunan, Taiwan, and Hainan showed faster increased in cases than the overall national trend. The increase of cases in Jilin, Liaoning, Shanxi, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces were also relatively fast. The increase of cases in other provinces were consistent with or lower than the overall 30, the case number has exceeded the total number of the SARS-CoV outbreak 20 . To cope with the outbreak, the Spring Festival holiday had been extended for two times. Prevention and control of the outbreak became a concerted action of the whole people in China.The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02. 10.20021824 doi: medRxiv preprint adopted mobility control measures to encourage people to avoid going to public places and wear masks when going out to reduce the risk of human to human transmission. We believe that with the joint efforts of everyone, the number of cases and losses will be kept to a minimum..

To obtain a general profile of the distribution, we first analyzed all the available cases during this 2019-nCoV pneumonia outbreak 16 . As shown in Figure 1A , the number of cases remained stable from January 11 to 15, 2020, and the number of newly added and cumulative cases increased rapidly after January 16. The first death was reported on January 10, and the number of deaths began to increase rapidly from January 17, with the cumulative death number reaching 312 on January 30 ( Figure 1B ) 6 . After the nucleic acid assay becoming available, suspected cases waiting for laboratory confirmation could now be diagnosed more rapidly 17 . After January 19, suspected cases increased rapidly, and about 40-50% of these suspected cases were then diagnosed as confirmed cases ( Figure 1C ). Before January 19, the number of severe cases, remained at a low level but increased steadily since January 20 ( Figure 1D ). Because Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei province and the cases have spread to the rest of Hubei province quickly, we also analyzed the change in number of cases in Hubei province. On January 9, 41 cases were first reported, and by January 30, 5,806 cases were reported, accounting for 59.91% of the total cases in China ( Figure 1E ). The cumulative number of deaths in Hubei province is 249, accounting for 96.14% of total deaths in China ( Figure 1F ). These data indicated that both the incidence and mortality of 2019-nCoV disease is the highest in Hubei province 18 . Before January 16, cases were mainly reported in Hubei province. From January 17 onward, the outbreak spread to many provinces and the number of cases increased rapidly. Therefore, our spatial and temporal analyses used data from January 17 to January 30, 2020.Location of each case was extracted from official reports and mapped on the national map .

As shown in

Although all people participated in the campaign against the outbreak, people in area with low case number considered that the disease is far away. Therefore, awareness of high-risk regions is import for preparation and responses for all the people, particularly those in regions with low incidence. Another reason we need to keep in mind is that 5 millions of persons have been emigrated from Wuhan to all over the country, we do not know exact who of them are virus carriers, and it is impossible to track and diagnose them all. Therefore, isolation at home and less contact with others is the most efficient measure to prevent infection and transmission.With the reported cases, we analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution. In general, the number of cases is still on the rise. For Hubei Province, which has the highest number of cases and deaths, the growing trend is relatively stable. Conversely in other hot spots, the number of cases were not so high, but the rate of growth continues to rise and therefore should be closely monitored. It is particularly noteworthy that cities with the fastest change in temporal risk, such as Chongqing, have large population movements and rapid temporal risk.If they are not strictly monitored, there may be more outbreaks. In order to prevent disease outbreaks caused by the returning travel wave to the city after the Spring Festival, the country has extended the Spring Festival holiday twice to February 9, 2020. However, as the number of new cases is still increasing, the outbreak is unlikely to end before the end of the holiday. Therefore, we must act together to stop the spread of the disease. At present, the state has . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

"Abstract

RNA viruses are the only known RNA-protein (RNP) entities capable of autonomous replication (albeit within a permissive environment). A 33.5-kb nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is ~200 kb. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps on the road to DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of size constraints on RNP entities. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20-34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with a proofreading exoribonuclease encoded in the nidoviral open reading frame 1b (ORF1b). However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region, and overall 41.1 kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, and key replicative domains. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and subsequently acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts. PSCNV's greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique featuresimpressive in themselvesattest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery. author/funder.

","Introduction

Radiation of primitive life over its initial two billion years of evolution was likely accompanied by genome expansion and a proposed transition from RNA-based through RNA-protein to DNA-based life (1) . The feasibility of an autonomous ancient RNA genome and the mechanisms underlying such fateful transitions are challenging to reconstruct. It is especially unclear whether such RNA entities ever evolved genomes close to the 100-300 kilobases (kb) range (2, 3) of the ""minimal"" reconstructed cellular DNA genome (4) . This range overlaps with the upper size limit of nuclear pre-mRNAs (5) ; however, pre-mRNAs are incapable of self-replication, the defining property of primordial genomic RNAs.RNA viruses may uniquely illuminate the evolutionary constraints on RNA genome size, whether or not they descended directly from primitive RNA-based entities (6) (7) (8) . The average-sized RNA virus genome is around 10 kb, due to low-fidelity RNA replication without proofreading (9) . However, positive-stranded RNA genomes of viruses of the order Nidovirales, which includes pathogenic coronaviruses, range from 12.7 to 33.5 kb, the largest known RNA genome (10, 11) (Fig. 1A , Table S1 ). These viruses may have evolved genomes larger than 20 kb after acquiring a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) that improved replication fidelity (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . Despite this notable innovation, over the last 20 years of virus discovery, including unbiased metagenomics of invertebrate and vertebrate RNA viruses (18, 19) , the largest-known RNA viral genome has only increased ~10% in sizea mere fraction of the nearly ten-fold increase observed for DNA viruses (20) (21) (22) (Fig. 1A) . Apparently, genome sizes of large nidoviruses are tightly constrained by the interplay of genetic and hostspecific factors, with the size of open reading frame 1b (ORF1b), encoding key replicative enzymes, emerging as a major barrier for further genome expansion (23) . Hence, ~34 kb is considered the de facto limit of RNA virus genome size (18) .

Results and discussion

Identification of a large RNA virus from planarians. To examine whether this limit applies beyond the currently recognized ~3000 RNA virus species that infect just hundreds of host species, further sampling of virus diversity is required. To this end, we analyzed de novo transcriptomes of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea (24) , in which viruses remain virtually unknown, and which exists as two reproductively distinct strains: sexuals that reproduce as simultaneous hermaphrodites and asexuals that reproduce via transverse fission (25) . We determined the complete genome sequence of a putative nidovirus corresponding to one particularly large contig (SI Text, Table S2 , Fig. S1 ). Excluding the polyadenylated tail, the fully assembled genome contains 41,103 nucleotides (nt) and encodes a single 40,671-nt ORF that is flanked by a 128-nt 5'-UTR and a 304-nt 3'-UTR (Fig. 1B,C) . The presence of this RNA in vivo was confirmed by RT-PCR amplification of overlapping regions of 4-7 kb, 5'-RACE, and multiple EST clones (Fig. S1) (26) . These sequences could not be amplified from S. mediterranea genomic DNA, nor could they be found in the genome (27) ; thus, they appear to derive from an exogenous source. Based on several criteria (see below), we assigned this RNA sequence to the genome of a virus we dubbed Planarian Secretory Cell Nidovirus (PSCNV). PSCNV circulates in both sexual and asexual host strains: analysis of RNA-seq data from three laboratories revealed its very low (<0.1%), albeit predominantly non-synonymous variation (SI Text, Tables S3,4). Analysis of Planaria torva transcriptome identified three contigs of the cumulative ~9400 nt size, whose regions displayed from 25% to 48% aa identity with PSCNV, indicative of at least one additional putative nidovirus (SI Text, Fig. S2 ) (28) . author/funder.

The genome and proteome of PSCNV are by far the largest yet reported for an RNA virus. Its RNA genome is ~25% larger than that of the next-largest known RNA virus (also a nidovirus), which is separated by a comparable margin from the first nidovirus genome sequenced 30 years ago (Fig. 1A) . The size of the predicted PSCNV polyprotein (13,556 amino acids, aa) is 58-67% larger than the largest known RNA virus proteins produced from a single ORF (8,572 aa) or multiple ORFs through frameshifting (8,108 aa) (Fig. 1D) .We delineated at least twenty domains in the PSCNV polyprotein using a complex multistage procedure that combined different analyses within a probabilistic framework ( Fig. 1C ; SI Text, Table S5 , and Figs. S3-S16). These domains include distant homologs of all ten domains characteristic of invertebrate nidoviruses (15, 29) and established with utmost confidence: seven ORF1a/1b enzymes (3C-like protease, 3CLpro; nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase, NiRAN; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp; superfamily 1 helicase, HEL1; exoribonuclease of DEDDh subfamily, ExoN; and SAM-dependent N7-and 2'-O-methyltransferases, N-MT and O-MT, respectively) and three non-enzymatic domains (transmembrane domain 2 and 3, TM2 and TM3, respectively; and zinc-binding domain, ZBD) (Fig. 1C) . These domains are syntenic in PSCNV and nidoviruses, with the conservation of NiRAN and ZBD in PSCNV being of particular significance, since both domains are the only known genetic markers of the order Nidovirales (29, 30) . Thus, these findings further support the phylogenetic affinity of PSCNV and nidoviruses (Fig. 1C) , which we quantified in separate analyses (see below). Accordingly, three functional regions corresponding to the ORF1a, ORF1b, and 3'ORFs of nidoviruses could be identified tentatively in the PSCNV genome, with three characteristic nidovirus domains mapping to the ORF1a-like region and seven domains to the ORF1b-like region.The enzymatic domains contain most essential catalytic residues, suggesting that they retain canonical functions, although notable deviations were also observed (Figs. S7-S14). Unique features of PSCNV's putative enzymes include: a) 3CLpro encodes a valine (Val) residue in the position commonly occupied by a His residue in the putative substrate-binding pocket (GXV vs G/YXH) that controls the P1 substrate preference for Glu or glutamine (Gln) residues (31-35); b) a Ser residue of the nidovirus-specific SDD signature of RdRp (12) is replaced by glycine (Gly)a characteristic of ssRNA+ viruses other than nidoviruses; c) the invariant aspartate (Asp), along with the highly conserved Ser/Thr, of motif B N of the NiRAN (29) are substituted with Thr and Asn, respectively; d) four Cys/His residues coordinating a Zn 2+ in the active site of ExoN (16, 17) are replaced in PSCNV, which, like non-nidoviral homologs , apparently lacks this Zn-finger.Conserved sequence features reveal that, as in other nidoviruses (12, 36) , the PSCNV 3'ORFs-like region may encode major structural proteins of enveloped virions, including the transmembrane glycoproteins known as S and M in coronaviruses, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (SI Text, Fig. S4 ). This region also appears to encode several notable domains: a ~130 aa region with Thr and Ser accounting for 70.7% of residues (Fig. S4 ); an Ankyrin domain (Figs. 1E and S16) and two fibronectin type II domains (FN2a and FN2b; Fig. S15 ), unique for RNA and all viruses, respectively. The Thr-rich and Thr/Ser-rich regions have been implicated in mediating adherence of fungal and bacterial extracellular (glyco) proteins to various substrates (37, 38) , suggesting a similar role in PSCNV. The Ankyrin domain might counteract host immune responses by suppressing the NF-kB signaling pathway, as observed in poxviruses (39) , while FN2a/b could facilitate virus dissemination (SI Text). author/funder.

We also identified a ribonuclease T2 homolog upstream of the putative 3CLpro in the ORF1a-like region (Fig. 1C) , in which all active-site residues are conserved ( Fig. S6 ). Pestivirus and polydnavirus ribonuclease T2 homologs modulate cell toxicity and immunity (40, 41) .PSCNV likely derived from multi-ORF nidoviruses and expanded disproportionately in the ORF1b-like region. To learn about the evolution of PSCNV, we inferred the rooted phylogeny of PSCNV based on the RdRp protein domain of nidoviruses and two astroviruses ( Fig. 1F ; SI Text). PSCNV predominantly clustered with other invertebrate nidoviruses in the Bayesian sample, basal to either mesoni-and roniviruses (54.7% of the trees), roniviruses (20.6%), or mesoniviruses (13.4%). Ancestral state reconstruction analysis indicated that the most recent common ancestor of nidoviruses contained multiple ORFs (Log Bayes Factor 6.06) (Fig. S17) . Thus, the single-ORF organization of PSCNV likely emerged through loss of signals separating the three ORF regions of ancestral nidoviruses.Compared to known nidoviruses, PSCNV genome size increased unevenly in the three main regions (Fig. 1G ,H, SI Text, Table S6 ). The size increase of the ORF1b-like region was an extraordinary 9-fold higher than would be expected from the extremely low variation in the size of this region among other nidoviruses normalized to genome size variation. This observation implies that PSCNV broke the tightly constrained ORF1b size barrier (23), but expanded modestly in the ORF1a-like and 3'ORFs-like regions. This pattern fits the wavelike dynamic model of genome expansion in nidoviruses (23) . Accordingly, extant nidovirus genomes of different sizes reached particular points on a common trajectory of genome expansion dominated by consecutive increases of ORF1b, ORF1a, and 3'ORFs. A complete cycle of genome expansion was reported to encompass the 12.7-31.7 kb range, with the expansion of ORF1b expected to lead a second cycle beyond that size range. The sizes of PSCNV's three main regions support this model, and show that nidoviruses were able to start a second cycle of genome expansion, whose feasibility has remained uncertain so far. This observation makes plausible the existence of other yet-undiscovered nidoviruses that have moved further along this genome-expanding trajectory.PSCNV infects the secretory cells of planarians. We next examined PSCNV infection in planarian tissues by whole-mount in situ hybridization (ISH). PSCNV RNA was detected abundantly in cells of the secretory system in both sexuals and asexuals ( Fig. 2A) . Fluorescent ISH revealed viral RNA in gland cell projections that form secretory canals (Fig.  2B) . Notably, viral RNA was detected largely in ventral cells (Fig. 2C ) whose localization corresponds to mucus-secreting cells producing the slime upon which planarians glide, and use to immobilize prey (42) .We then analyzed planarians by electron microscopy (EM) for the presence of viral structures. Membrane-bound compartments with 90-150 nm spherical-to-oblong particles resembling nidoviral nucleocapsids (43, 44) were found in the cytoplasm of mucus-secreting cells, which are abundant in planarian parenchyma. These sub-epidermal gland cells are notable for their extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum and long projections into the ventral epithelium, through which they secrete mucus (Fig. S18) . These cells provide an ideal environment for nidoviral replicationwhich co-opts host membranes to produce viral replication complexes (45) . Putative viral particles were found both in deep regions of these cells, and in their trans-epidermal projections (Fig. 3A-C) . The latter location suggests a author/funder. All rights reserved.

Notably, particles in sub-epidermal layers have a ""hazy"" appearance and are embedded in a relatively electron-dense matrix (Fig. 3D) . In contrast, particles closer to the apical surface of the epidermis appear as relatively discrete structures, standing out against electron-lucent surrounding material (Fig. 3E) . The size, ultrastructure, and host-cell locations are all consistent with these structures being nidoviral nucleocapsids (43, 44) .Potential mechanisms for varying stoichiometries of viral proteins encoded by a single-ORF genome. Virus reproduction requires different viral protein stoichiometries at distinct replicative cycle stages, a challenge for a single-ORF genome theoretically producing equimolar quantities of encoded polypeptides. For example, the putative structural proteins encoded by 3'ORFs are needed in much larger quantities than replicative enzymes at the end of nidovirus infection, and vice versa. We analysed the PSCNV genome and its transcript expression to resolve this apparent paradox.Nidoviruses use -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) at the ORF1a/1b border to attenuate the synthesis of major replicative enzymes upon genome translation (46) . We located a potential -1 PRF signal in the canonical position in the PSCNV genome (SI Text). This signal could potentially attenuate in-frame translation downstream of the ORF1a-like region (Fig. 4A ) similar to a mechanism used by encephalomyocarditis virus (47) .The PSCNV putative 3CLpro domain is expected (31) to release itself and all downstream polyprotein components up to the border between the ORF1b-and 3'ORFs-like regions (Fig.  1C) . The polyprotein region processed by 3CLpro, and its flanking regions, are of comparable sizes (5006 vs 4400 and 4150 aa), suggesting further posttranslational processing. Indeed, we have identified a number of candidate cleavage sites for host furinlike proteases (Fig. S4) , commonly involved in processing viral glycoprotein precursors (48) (SI Text).We obtained several lines of evidence for upregulated transcription of the 3'ORFs-like region (Fig. 4B-D; SI Text). The PSCNV genome contains a pair of 59 and 57-nt imperfect repeats with 86% identity starting at positions 3 and 28,389, respectively (Fig. 4B) ; their positioning immediately upstream of ORF1a-like and at the border between ORF1b-and 3'ORFs-like regions resembles that of leader and body transcription-regulating sequences (l-and bTRSs) in other nidoviruses (49) . Accordingly, we found a sharp (~3-fold) change in RNA-seq read coverage at the bTRS. We identified an RNA species (by 5'-RACE), whose first two and following 57 nucleotides matched the genomic 5'-terminal AU followed by the bTRS (Fig.  4B) , suggesting the presence of a subgenomic mRNA produced by discontinuous transcription. Furthermore, the bTRS potentially forms strong complementary interactions with its upstream and downstream sequences (Fig. 4C ). When unwound, the upstream sequence can form a duplex with the lTRS, bringing together the two spatially separated genomic regions, consistent with a model of discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis (Fig.  4D) resembling that of other nidoviruses (50) .

Conclusions

The advent of metagenomics and transcriptomics have greatly accelerated the pace of virus discovery, leading to studies reporting genome sequences of dozens to thousands of new RNA viruses in poorly characterized hosts (18, 19, 51, 52) . These developments have substantially advanced our appreciation of RNA virus diversity, and improved our author/funder. All rights reserved.

Notwithstanding that sea change, the largest known RNA genomes continue to belong to nidoviruses, as has been the case for 30 years since the first coronavirus genome of 27 kb was sequenced (11, 15, 55) (Fig. 1A) . The unbiased, transcriptomics-based discovery of PSCNV in planarians reinforces the status of nidoviruses as relative giants among RNA viruses, while demonstrating that RNA genomes may be substantially larger than previously understood. Further, genomic and proteomic characteristics of PSCNV defy the perceived central role of multiple ORFs in the life cycle and evolution of nidoviruses. Contrary to conventional wisdom, single-ORF genome expression may involve subgenomic mRNA synthesis, while functional constraints linked to the synteny of key replicative enzymes may be the hallmark characteristics of nidoviruses. Since the ORF1b-size barrier can be overcome and genome organization changed, nidoviruses of yet-to-be-sampled hosts might prove to have evolved even larger RNA genomes than that reported here, further decreasing the gap between virus RNA and host DNA genome sizes.

"Abstract

The likelihood of cross-species transmission is related to phenotypic plasticity of a virus and its capacity to produce genetically variable progeny. Herein a model is described connecting the production of genetic variability with increasing genome size. Comparing all known zoonotic viral genome sizes to known non-zoonotic viral genome sizes demonstrates that zoonotic viruses have significantly larger genomes. These results support the notion that large viral genomes are important in producing new zoonotic disease, and suggest that genome size may be a useful surrogate in screening for potential zoonotic viruses.

","Introduction

Human population expansion continually redefines the interactions between humans and wildlife.Zoonotic diseases that emerge from these interactions account for over 60% of human infectious diseases [1] . Although this figure may represent over 2 billion new cases annually, zoonoses are characteristically underreported and misdiagnosed [2] . Because zoonoses affect humans and other vertebrates, they also generate substantial economic losses, as livestock death and human disability lead to loss of productivity [3] . For example, economic losses due to Ebola in 2014 were $2.2 billion [4] . Zoonotic outbreaks also present an increasingly pressing risk to human health due to higher densities of people with little to no immunity to novel pathogens. They are often unpredictable in occurrence and are caused by new species against which there are no developed vaccines, treatment, or public health protocol. This is particularly true for viruses that have great capacity to mutate, even during the course of a pandemic [1, 5] . This century has seen numerous pandemics caused by zoonotic viruses like Ebola, Nipah, Avian Influenza, and Coronavirus [5] .In late 2019, a novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged and has since killed over 3000 people, making it the deadliest Coronavirus pandemic in recent history [6, 7] . The Wuhan province in China, where the virus emerged, effectively quarantined its populace, and many countries restricted travel of their own citizens to China. Although human to human transmission is driving current transmission, its emergence was facilitated by close human-animal contact, much like its predecessors SARS and MERS [8] . Members of the Coronavididae family are widely known to jump across host taxa to become infectious in new populations [9, 10] . Non-pathogenic varieties in a reservoir population can become pathogenic in new species. This phenomenon is well documented in many viral zoonoses, yet Coronaviruses pose exceptional risk to human populations due to the variety of potential reservoirs and the virulence of the emergent pandemics they 2 cause [10] . The ability of Coronaviruses to shift to new species is due in part to the mutation rate they exhibit, but they are not exceptional among viruses in this way. They are exceptional, however, in their high frequency of recombination and in possessing the largest of the ssRNA viral genomes [11, 12] . These two characteristics provide ample opportunity for Coronaviruses to evolve new traits and establish themselves in new host species.The capacity to produce genetic variability is a defining feature among viruses that are able to jump to new host species. Mutations and recombination events have been explored as a source of this variability. Both processes have been implicated in producing new viral strains or species responsible for observed pandemics [13] . The rates of mutation and recombination are known to vary across viral taxa and within viral genomes [14] . For example, RNA viruses characteristically mutate faster than DNA viruses due to polymerase infidelity, and hypermutable regions within some viral genomes have been demonstrated. Likewise, recombination processes vary considerably by viral type: reassortment is common in viruses with multi-segmented genomes, while homologous or non-homologous recombination is predominant in viruses with non-segmented genomes [14, 15] .A primary challenge for virologists and public health professionals is identifying characteristics of viruses that lead to higher likelihoods of new outbreaks [1] . The variety of mechanisms by which genetic variation can be produced makes finding clear patterns in zoonotic risk difficult [2, 13] . One yet unconsidered viral characteristic likely to facilitate cross-species infections is the size of the viral genome. Both the total number of mutations accumulated during replication and the probability of a recombination event increase with the size of a genome when replication mechanisms are conserved, though nucleotide substitutions from either process often lead to net reduction in fitness of progeny. The number of substitutions, thus potential for reduction in host-specific fitness, increases with genome size [16] [17] [18] . If genetic variability is instrumental in producing cross-species infections, genome size should be positively related to the likelihood of viral spillover events provided lethal substitutions do not substantially reduce the mean fitness of the viral population.

Results

Cross-species transmission for each viral particle is assumed to be a function of the phenotypic plasticity of the viral genome and the genetic variability produced during replication [13, 15, 19] . The probability of a transmission event occurring can be represented as:where λ ∈ [0, ∞) is the weighted contribution of plasticity over variability in promoting crossspecies transmission and L is the length of the viral genome. Although a relationship between genome size and phenotypic plasticity is probable, little work has enlightened the nature of this relationship. What is clear is that transcription and gene regulation networks can become more complex with increasing number of nucleotides [20, 21] . Variability produced with each replication event can be more accurately approximated. Variability is produced via mutation and recombination (reassortment, non-homologous and homologous). Given per nucleotide rates of mutation (µ) and recombination (R), the accumulation of variability per genome should increase linearly as (µ + R(1 − µ))L. When µ and R are small, this variability can be expressed as (µ + R)L. Lethal mutagenesis and incompatible recombinants reduce viability of viral products. Viability converges to e −µγL across mutational models [18] and is calculated as ρfor recombination [17] (see supplement), where γ is the proportion of lethal mutations, ρ is the genome-specific tolerance to recombination events, and D ∈ [0, 1] is the sequence divergence between co-infecting viruses. Per nucleotide variability (dV /dN ) produced with each replication event can be given as:Per genome variability (dV /dG) can be given as:Assuming the number of polymerase enzymes scales with genome size [22, 23] , a rate of production of variability can be derived.The efficiency of replication of each genome can be represented as L/(I + L), where I is the product of the time required for replication initiation and termination, and r, the rate of polymerase-mediated replication. Figure 1 displays equations 2-4 parameterized to represent positive sense ssRNA viruses. Per nucleotide variability production decreases with genome size due to reduced fitness with accumulated substitutions (Fig. 1A ). However, genome-level variability production increases almost linearly with genome size, revealing that the rate of fitness reduction from the accumulation of deleterious substitutions does not outpace the increased variability associated with increase in genome size (Fig. 1B) . Because more genomes can be replicated in a fixed amount of time for smaller genomes, the total variability produced in unit time gives indication of whether population-level variability increases with genome size.In fact, Fig. 1C shows that population-level variability is maximized within the known size range of ssRNA(+) viral genomes. Variability production per unit time continues to decline for genome sizes larger than 50,000 nt, though no known ssRNA viruses have genomes larger than 35,000 nt [12] . The maximum variability production per unit time is dependent on the efficiency of replication. Because Coronaviruses have much larger genomes than other ssRNA(+) viruses, they have evolved 3 − → 5 exoribonuclease repair and have lower mutation rates than other ssRNA(+) viruses [24] . Substituting this mutation rate in equation 4 produces a curve ( Fig. S2 ) with a maximum shifted to the right, reflecting that production of genetic variability is 5 .

Considering these theoretical results, variability is greater per virion produced for viruses with larger genomes. Because population-level production of variability has been shown to improve viral survival via immune evasion [14] , there is likely strong selection toward viral genome sizes close to the peak described by equation 4 (Fig. 1C) . Even in the absence of phenotypic plasticity conferred by large genomes, viruses with large genomes have high potential to generate variability that promotes cross-species transmission events. Zoonotic viruses should, therefore, possess larger genomes than other viruses. To examine the relationship between viral genome size and likelihood of zoonosis, this study compiles a comprehensive list of all known viral zoonoses and leverages the entire NCBI database of viral genomes [12].Peer-reviewed literature from 1920 to 2019 was searched via the Web of Science electronic library for viral zoonoses. Search key words included ""zoonotic"", ""zoonoses"", ""emerging disease"", ""viral spillover"", ""animal to human transmission"", and ""animal reservoir virus"". After cross examination of all viruses yielded through this search, all confirmed zoonotic viruses transmitted from animals to humans in the past 100 years that also had a complete genome sequence were included in the analysis. This set encompasses 126 viral species from 40 genera in groups 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Baltimore classification system, grouped by genome structure. Genome sizes for all viruses were retrieved from the NCBI genome database or from peer-reviewed reports of fully sequenced genomes. The entire NCBI viral genome database of 9238 sequenced genomes was downloaded and filtered to remove incomplete, prokaryote, fungus, protist, and plant associated viral sequences. 2088 animal associated virus species in the five evaluated Baltimore groups remained after removal of zoonotic virus sequences. All species were categorized by genome structure according to the Baltimore classification system.One-tailed Welch's T-tests for sample means were performed for each Baltimore group, comparing the genome sizes of zoonotic viruses with all other non-zoonotic viruses. Table 1 

Discussion

This finding strongly suggests that large genome size facilitates emergence of viral zoonoses.The signal is clear despite the large diversity of viruses within each Baltimore group and despite not accounting for viruses that share or jump between animal host species. Viruses with a wide host range likely share characteristics with zoonotic viruses, and based on these results, should have large genomes as well. For example, numerous species of Coronavirus are included in the non-zoonotic list (n=42) because they are not directly implicated in zoonoses, yet they are known to exhibit wide host ranges [9, 10] . Specifically, several bat Coronaviruses are in the non-zoonotic list, though researchers largely regard these viruses as the close relatives to SARS and MERS CoV [25] . This fact likely impaired the resolution of the relationship between genome size and cross-species transmission, resulting in the single non-significant pvalue across evaluated groups. Large genomes are likely to facilitate zoonotic transmission via high mutational load per genome replication or high probability of recombination; both processes produce variability by which cross-species infection may occur. Genome sizes for some viral groups, especially dsDNA viruses, are tightly correlated with increasing number of genes (R 2 = 0.91, Fig. S2 ). More coding regions within the genome could lead to greater plasticity and expanded host range, as reliance on host replication machinery is reduced [21, 26] .Among the viral groups there exists much variation in replication strategy, thus there is potential for differences in the predominant strategy for producing genetic variability leading to 7 .

Though mutation rate is 100 fold lower per nucleotide for dsDNA viruses than for RNA viruses, their much larger genomes enable a comparable likelihood of accumulating at least one mutation during replication. A negative correlation between mutation rate and genome size has been noted for a small set of viruses for which mutation rate has been directly measured [14] . Much of the correlation for RNA viruses results from measurement of bacteriophage mutation rate, and this interesting relationship should be further explored. Coronaviruses have evolved 3 − → 5 proofreading capabilities to accommodate mutagenesis associated with a large genome [24] . As recombination is generally associated with lower reduction in fitness compared to mutation, recombination may be the preferred mechanism to generate genetic variability for the viruses with the largest genomes. dsDNA viruses are known to have high per nucleotide rates of non-homologous recombination. Because of the large genome sizes of dsDNA viruses, the likelihood of at least one recombination event occurring during replication of the genome is high [15, 27] . The many coded genes of ds-DNA viruses allow more easily incorporation of recombinant DNA without deleterious effects and may reduce host specificity through phenotypic plasticity [15, 17] . In contrast, Papillomaviruses are dsDNA viruses that are characteristically species-specific [28] . These viruses have small genomes with little plasticity to accommodate recombinant DNA or expand host range. dsRNA viruses are highly segmented, and the number of segments is highly correlated with the size of the genome (R 2 = 0.84, Fig. S2) , which allows for a high degree of recombination via reassortment of segments during a coinfection [15] . Gene expression is regulated by translation for ssRNA(+) viruses. This group includes Coronaviruses and is known for high levels of homologous recombination because of frequent template switching during discontinuous transcription. Having the largest RNA viral genomes, Coronaviruses can produce over 25% recombinant progeny with their high rates of recombination [11, 15] . ssRNA(-) viruses are not known to recombine with high frequency, so their genetic variation relies on high mutation 8 .

Pseudodiploidy in retroviruses can promote recombination due to the physical proximity of RNA strands in the virion as well as partial masking of deleterious mutations [30] . Large genomes are more likely to contain intergenic, non-coding regions that assist in gene regulation but also serve as hotspots for recombination and mutation due to weaker selection to conserve these regions [17] . Viral zoonoses can emerge as a result of large genetic changes associated with recombination or significant mutation-both more likely to occur in large genomes. Phenotypic plasticity is hypothesized to be positively related to genome size and may facilitate cross-species transmission, though this notion requires future exploration. The relationship between likelihood of zoonotic transmission and genome size has implications for predicting future zoonoses and for understanding general principles about viral life history. Host specificity may be considered a function of genome reduction. Guiding principles like the relationship between genome size and host range should be explored to broaden scientific understanding of the viral world and its role in ecosystems. Predicting future epidemics requires knowledge of potential zoonotic viruses. Far less than 1% of viruses have been discovered, and the potential host interactions of each viral species are even less well-characterized, making zoonotic risks difficult to estimate [31] . These data demonstrate that viral genome size is an effective indicator of zoonotic risk across viral genome subtypes. In an age of high-throughput genomics and rapid discovery of new viruses, characterization of recombination and mutation rates is far slower and more laborintensive than genome sequencing, making genome size an appealing first step in zoonotic risk evaluation. Analysis of viral genome size and structure has the potential to provide deep insights in predicting future pandemics.

Methods

Derivation of Equation 2. The accumulation of substitutions in a genome occurs via mutation and recombination, with associated per nucleotide rates µ and R. These rates can be interpreted as the per nucleotide probability of a substitution occurring in a replication event. Assuming mutation and recombination are independent processes, the probability of a substitution (variability) at each nucleotide can be represented as:The probability that a substitution occurs for each nucleotide can be interpreted as a rate of substitution per replication event. Substitution events are assumed to be deleterious. Each event contributes to the reduction in fitness of the viral progeny, and these events accumulate in a genome, creating non-linear declines in fitness. Viral genome size is constrained by this reduction in fitness: larger genomes accumulate more substitutions and potential for fitness reduction is greater than for small genomes [14, 18] . Nucleotide-level fitness thus corresponds to genome-level fitness, and successful production of nucleotide variability is constrained by the fitness decay that occurs with increasing genome size. For purposes here, fitness will be synonymous with viability of each replicated genome. Setting the fitness of the parental virion or template genome at 1, fitness of progeny takes values between 0 and 1. Because a mutation and recombination event at a given nucleotide are mutually exclusive, the probability of each event occurring separately can be calculated asAcross mutational models, fitness (infectivity) due to lethal mutagenesis is given as ω mut = e −µγ(nt) [18] . The fitness in the event of recombination is demonstrated to be ω recomb = ρ m(d−m) d−1 [17] , where m is the number of amino acid substitution events due to recombination and d is the . Because mutation and recombination are components of fitness, the probability of each occurring with exclusion of the other at each nucleotide must be accounted. This can be done by replacing µ with P r(µ\R)and R with P r(R\µ). Genome-level fitness for substitution events can be calculated asThe resulting rate of per nucleotide variability produced is the product of variability accumulation and the average fitness of each genome replicated.When µ and R are sufficiently small such that µR µ, R (i.e. lim µ,R→0 µR µ+R = 0), then equation S5 can be approximated asThis is given by equation 2 in the main text.Parameter values for figure 1. in table S1. r is the rate constant (k pol ) for RNA dependent RNA polymerase in nucleotides per second. This is the speed at which the replicase complex can replicate RNA. I is the product of r and the amount of additional time (in seconds) required to replicate a strand of RNA outside of the elongation phase plus any additional delay associated with replicating multiple, short strands of RNA rather than fewer, long strands on which multiple replicase complexes could be active simultaneously. The value for I chosen was simply an order of magnitude smaller than the large Coronavirus genomes, though this delay has not been quantified in scientific literature. This value is important in determining the genome size at which the maximum rate of production of genetic variability (per second) occurs. µ is the mutation rate per nucleotide per replication event by RNA dependent RNA polymerase. This quantity can vary around the value given in table S1, but the value chosen is an appropriate approximation for ssRNA(+) viruses.R is the recombination rate per nucleotide per replication event. This value varies considerably in RNA viruses but tends to be high for many ssRNA(+) viruses. γ gives the proportion of lethal mutations of the total number of mutations. The vast majority of mutations fall into three categories: neutral, deleterious, or lethal. There is likely variation in the respective proportions of each for viruses, though few attempts have been made to quantify these proportions. In the study referenced, one-third of mutations resulted in viral particles that were not capable of infecting (infectivity assay). This constitutes a lethal mutation and is a good estimate of fitness reduction for cross-species transmission events. ρ represents the effective tolerance of proteins to a single recombination event. Misfolding proteins likely constitute lethality or severe reduction in fitness in viruses, so this measure is used to simulate the reduction in fitness in the event of amino acid substitutions due to recombination. D is the proportion of dissimilar nucleotides in a co-infecting viral strain or species. Higher dissimilarity results in higher probability of amino acid substitutions due to recombination. 12% dissimilarity is the nucleotide dissimilarity between COVID-19 and SARS-COV.Literature review. Peer-reviewed scientific literature was searched for reports on zoonotic viruses transmitted from animals to humans using the Web of Science electronic library database for published reports through 2019. Keywords were used in the search as specified in the main text. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization reports as well as published compilations of human infectious diseases were also used as references, but reported viruses were cross-validated as zoonotic with other supporting peer-reviewed literature [1, 5, 19] . Zoonotic viruses were identified as having known non-human and human hosts via molecular or serological assay (seroconversion). Viral infections supported by circumstantial evidence sans assay verification were not included. The list of zoonotic viruses was formed after searching for complete genome sequences on the NCBI database [12] then extending to other peer-reviewed full genome sequences if the virus was not found in the NCBI database.This final list included 126 unique viral species. Each viral species was classified according to the Baltimore classification system by mRNA production/genome structure. The compiled list is included as table S3.Non-zoonotic virus filtering. The entire NCBI database on viral genomes was downloaded and screened for animal-associated viruses. The category of unidentified viruses was excluded from the screening process. All incomplete sequences were excluded as well. The majority of viruses are labeled with host associations, though in many instances, these labels were found to be inaccurate. Viruses were organized by families and screened initially by known host range. Viral families associated with prokaryotes, archaea, plants, or fungi exclusively were not included. Satellite viruses and viroids were also excluded. Remaining genera and species were manually cross-checked with existing literature to verify the belonging as animal associated. If 13 .

The animal grouping was assigned due to the difficulty of parsing associations further to vertebrates. Many viruses are recovered from vectors or other invertebrates, yet have known or unknown association with vertebrates. Sometimes viruses have no known association outside of an insect vector, though relatives of the virus are known to infect vertebrate hosts. As an exercise to ensure genome size did not differ substantially between vertebrate and invertebrate-associated viruses, another filtering process was conducted manually whereby each species was cross-validated with existing literature to remove known or likely known to not be associated with a vertebrate host.The total number of non-zoonotic viruses was reduced from 2088 to 1533 in this process.

"Abstract

In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered predominantly in different invertebrates and, as was recently shown, some of them may cause disease in humans. The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because, in contrast to the ""classic"" flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein(s) and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the JMTV group. Significance Statement We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV) from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks from two geographically separate areas of Russia in the Ixodes ricinus tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. The majority of virions of the ALSV strain Miass527 were enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of 40.5±3.7 nm. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the Jingmen tick virus group.

","Introduction

In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered in different invertebrates. All of them share homology in the nonstructural proteins with the well-studied flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5 and RNA helicase-protease NS3, but they differ greatly from each other regarding other proteins, as well as in overall genome size and structure .The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because in contrast to the ""classic"" flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome (Ladner et al., 2016; Maruyama et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019a) , which is more commonly observed in viruses of fungi and plants (Lefkowitz et al., 2018) . The only other known viruses with a segmented ssRNA (+) genome are representatives of the family Nodaviridae and infect insects (Alphanodavirus) and fish (Betanodavirus) (Yong et al., 2017) .Two segments of the JMTV group genome are homologous to the regions of the Flavivirus genome encoding NS3 and NS5 proteins. The remaining segments are specific only to JMTVs. Additionally, in contrast to the ""classic"" flaviviruses that have one long open reading frame (ORF) and virion size of 40-60 nm, these viruses have several ORFs within single segments and virion sizes varying from 30-35 nm to 70-100 nm (Ladner et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019a) . It has also been suggested that genomic RNAs of a multicomponent virus can be packaged in separate virions (Ladner et al., 2016) , although this has not yet been demonstrated.The geographic distribution of the JMTV group is very wide, encompassing Asia (Dinçer et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2019; Qin et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2016) , Europe (Dinçer et al., 2019;  Some representatives of the JMTV group were detected in patients with other infections transmitted by arthropods (Emmerich et al., 2018) .Alongshan virus (ALSV), a representative of the JMTV group, was detected in I. persulcatus ticks, Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles yatsushiroensis mosquitoes in China (Wang et al., 2019a) and later in I. ricinus ticks in Finland and France (Kuivanen et al., 2019; Temmam et al., 2019) . ALSV was suspected to infect mammals and cause illness in humans (Wang et al., 2019b (Wang et al., , 2019a .Our work presents data on the isolation of ALSV in the Russian Federation and new data on the genome organization of this and other known representatives of the JMTV group.

Detection and Isolation of Alongshan virus strains

We collected unfed adult I. persulcatus ticks in Chelyabinsk region and in the Republic of Karelia in May-June 2014 (Supplementary file 1). The ticks were pooled, homogenised and the homogenates screened for flavivirus NS5 RNA. The PCR products from three flaviviruspositive tick pools were Sanger-sequenced. The resultant sequences were analysed with BLAST.All three isolates, named Miass519, Miass527 and Galozero-14-T20426, were found to be 90.48 -91.03% similar to Alongshan virus.To isolate the virus from tick homogenate, we inoculated cultures of the IRE/CTVM19 tick cell line. An IRE/CTVM19 culture inoculated with the Miass527 sample was kept for a year with regular medium changes but without passaging or subculture; individual tick cell cultures can be maintained for long periods without subculture (Bell-Sakyi et al., 2007) . Since the virus did not cause any cytopathic effect in these cells, we changed the medium once every 14 days.Once every 1-2 months we checked the culture medium by RT-PCR for presence of the virus, using specific primers MiassF and MiassR (Supplementary file 2). After a year of maintenance, 200μl of supernate from the Miass527-infected IRE/CTVM19 culture was passaged into a new flat-sided culture tube with uninfected IRE/CTVM19 cells. This new Miass527-infected culture was subcultured by splitting the cells at a ratio of 1:1 twice in the first 6 months of infection and after that was kept without passaging or subculture. In this condition Miass527-infected cells have been monitored for over 3 years (observation is still continuing). IRE/CTVM19 cells inoculated with samples Miass519 and Galozero-14-T20426 were each subcultured 1:1 twice in the first 2 months after infection and, at the time of writing, have been monitored for 4 months.RT-PCR analysis revealed that the strain Miass527 successfully persisted in the tick cell line for a year, followed by one passage and further three years persistence at the time of writing..

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/862573 doi: bioRxiv preprintThe other two strains, Miass519 and Galozero-14-T20426, had persisted for at least 4 months at the time of writing.For two strains, Miass519 and Miass527, high-throughput sequencing of virus purified from IRE/CTVM19 cell supernate was carried out to obtain full genomes, while for the Galozero-14-T20426 strain partial sequences of segment 2 were obtained via Sanger sequencing using primers JMun1S and Miass_gly_1R (Table 1 , Supplementary file 2). For the phylogenetic analysis, we used RNA sequences from 18 GenBank entries of representatives of the JMTV group and the three ALSV strains isolated in the present study (Table 1 ). The phylogenetic analysis was performed on a 1732 bp fragment of segment 2. Interestingly, one of the JMTV isolates (MN095520 -isolate JMTV/I.ricinus/France) clustered with the ALSV sequences. For consistency, we included this JMTV sequence in all our analyses of ALSV (see below). All three of our strains belonged to ALSV and formed one monophyletic group with the strain H3 isolated in China (Figure 1 ).

Transmission Electron Microscopy

We used pool of cell culture supernate collected after one passage of strain Miass527 in IRE/CTVM19 cells, at 17, 19, 20 and 32 months after initial isolation for transmission electron microscopic examination. The IRE/CTVM19 tick cell line was recently reported to contain RNA sequences with similarity to rhabdoviruses (Bell-Sakyi and Attoui, 2016) . To prevent confusion between ALSV and this putative rhabdovirus in our microscopic examination, we first screened the pellet obtained after ultracentrifugation of uninfected IRE/CTVM19 for rhabdovirus RNA using specific primers (Supplementary file 2). We detected an unknown rhabdovirus and named it IRE/CTVM19-associated rhabdovirus. Since this new rhabdovirus was also detected in the Miass527-infected IRE/CTVM19 cell pellet, we subjected the dissolved pellet to sucrose density gradient separation and selected the fraction with the largest amount of ALSV RNA and very The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/862573 doi: bioRxiv preprint fraction of the gradient as used for the ALSV-infected IRE/CTVM19 cells. In this fraction we found small spherical particles with a diameter of 15.7 ± 1.8 nm, which had electron-dense cores ( Figure 2 , E, Supplementary file 6). These small particles could be virions of an unknown virus, protein structures or some other unidentified component of IRE/CTVM19 cells.The pellet obtained following ultracentrifugation of culture supernate was dissolved overnight in borate saline buffer (0.05M H 3 BO 4 , 0.12M NaCl, 0.24M NaOH), pH 9.0 (BSB), at 4 °C. A portion of the dissolved pellet was applied to a sucrose density gradient (15-60%) and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 4 h at 4°C using an SW-40 rotor in the Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, USA). To identify resultant density gradient fractions containing virus particles, aliquots of each fraction were subjected to RT-PCR and sequencing of amplified products as described below.The specimens after ultracentrifugation were adsorbed onto Formvar film attached to 200-mesh nickel EM grids and contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate (Nikitin et al., 2015) . The grids were exposed to UV light for one hour to inactivate the virus, air-dried and examined in a JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 80 kV. Images were acquired with an Olympus Quemesa digital camera using iTEM software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH, Munster, Germany).

Full genome, genome structure and proposed novel elements

We sequenced full genomes of the strains Miass527 and Miass519. Segments 1, 3 and 4 of the newly-isolated Miass strains were more similar to each other than to previously-described ALSV strains. However, segment 2 of the strain Miass527 was more similar to the Chinese strain H3 than to Miass519, while segment 2 of the strain Miass519 was closer to JMTV/I.ricinus/France than to Miass527 (Table 2) .Overall, the full genomes of the Miass strains demonstrated >88% nucleotide identity to the other strains of ALSV known to date, with glycoprotein-coding segment 2 having the highest similarity and NS5-like protein coding segment 1 being the most divergent. (Wang et al., 2019a) . Interestingly, we were not able to identify signal peptides in either VP2 or VP1a using TMHMM v.2.0 software.We performed a search of the functional elements in the VP1a region with the Synplot2 program (Firth, 2014) . Using codon alignment of four previously-described ALSV strains (MH158416, MN107154, MN107158, MN095520) and the three strains sequenced in this study, we discovered two regions of high conservation in the VP1a ORF ( Figure 4A ). The first one corresponded to the 3`-terminal region of the ORF. We believe that such high conservation in this region was caused by an overlap with the VP1b ORF. We managed to find a slippery motif (A AAA AAC) followed by a spacer and an RNA structure (Supplementary file 8) in this region .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/862573 doi: bioRxiv preprint of the VP1a ORF that theoretically would allow VP1b to be translated via -1 ribosome frameshift ( Figure 3 ).Additionally, Synplot2 allowed us to identify an unusually high conservation rate in the first ~110 codons of VP1a ORF in segment 2. We believe that this conservation was caused by an additional ORF that was found in this region. This novel upstream ORF (nuORF) is 399 nt long, is located upstream of the VP1a ORF and has a 365 nt overlap with it ( Figure 4A ).Application of the tblastn algorithm using the protein sequence encoded by the Miass527 nuORF as an entry revealed homologs within the JMTV group (Supplementary file 9). Upon further inspection, all of the resultant sequences were shown to have a nuORF. Thus we decided to test known JMTV sequences for existence of the additional ORF upstream of the VP1 region with Synplot2.We searched for a full-length segment 2 of JMTV using blast algorithm and strain SY84 JMTV full segment 2 sequence as an entry. Since relationships within the JMTV group are not yet decided and some representatives of this group have different names, we could not use a GenBank search. Sequences MN095532 and KX377514 were found to have unknown nucleotides in the middle of the segment and were not used in the analysis. For these sequences, nuORF was confirmed to be intact. We then constructed a phylogenetic tree (Supplementary file 10) that allowed us to identify three groups (Jingmen, Yanggou and Alongshan viruses) that should be analysed separately due to phylogenetic distance. All JMTV sequences with full segment 2 (21 entries) known to date (November 8, 2019) have a nuORF. We performed analysis of the JMTV segment 2 sequences ( Figure 4B ) and Synplot2 showed high conservation in the first ~100-codon region. This demonstrates that the region associated with nuORF is conserved more highly than would be expected under neutral evolution in both ALSV and JMTV sequences.We also tested the Yanngou virus sequences and, although all of the full genome sequences had a nuORF, Synplot2 program did not find a region of higher-than-expected conservation in the first ~100 codons of Yanngou virus VP1a (Supplementary file 11). However, there are only three known full-length segment 2 sequences of Yanggou virus and the number of sequences is important to acquire statistics needed for a prediction.Overall, the ALSV nuORF encoded 132 amino acids. According to the prediction, this protein may have an N-terminal signal sequence and three transmembrane regions with a Cterminal tail, thus making the nuORF product a small membrane protein ( Figure 5A ).The predicted protein encoded by the nuORF of JMTVs was shorter (~106 aa) and had ~50% identity to the ALSV nuORF product. It had an overall structure similar to that of ALSV, .

Discussion

Due to the development of molecular virology, high-throughput sequencing and viral metagenomics, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered in recent decades (Qin et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2016; Villa et al., 2017) . A large number of flavi-like viruses have been detected in or isolated from arthropods (Huhtamo et al., 2014 (Huhtamo et al., , 2009 Shi et al., 2016) , but their ability to cause infection and disease in vertebrates and their medical significance are not known.The JMTV group is a recently-discovered group of segmented ssRNA(+) viruses that infect different species of invertebrates, including insects, ticks and nematodes (Callister et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2019; Kuivanen et al., 2019; Qin et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2016; Tetteh et al., 1999; Webster et al., 2015) . Moreover, some representatives of the new flavi-like viruses were detected in patients who had other severe infectious diseases (Emmerich et al., 2018) , and these viruses might themselves cause illness in humans (Jia et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019a) . There is still little information about the replication and overall coding strategy of this novel virus group.ALSV is a representative of the JMTV group. It was first isolated in China from a patient suffering fever of unknown aetiology (Wang et al., 2019a) . Subsequently, the virus was detected in I. persulcatus ticks and Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles yatsushiroensis mosquitoes in China (Wang et al., 2019a) and in I. ricinus ticks in Finland (Kuivanen et al., 2019) and France (Temmam et al., 2019) . It was shown that ALSV is able to infect mammals and cause illness in humans (with symptoms including headache, fever, fatigue and depression) (Wang et al., 2019a (Wang et al., , 2019b . Thus, additional isolates of this virus from new geographical locations will be important for understanding its distribution, as well as for the local healthcare systems. New genome data could also provide additional information on the structural organization of the ALSV genome.We isolated three strains of ALSV from I. persulcatus ticks collected in Chelyabinsk region in the south of European Russia, and in the Republic of Karelia in north-west Russia. We sequenced two full genomes of the new ALSV strains Miass527 and Miass519 from Chelyabinsk region and obtained partial sequences of segment 2 for the ALSV strain Galozero-14-T20426 from the Republic of Karelia. Although these three strains were isolated from territories distant from each other, phylogenetic analysis of the segment 2 sequences showed that they form a single monophyletic group with the strain H3 isolated in China.The segments 1, 3 and 4 of the strains Miass519 and Miass527 were more similar to each other than to previously described ALSV strains. Segment 2 of the strain Miass527 was more similar to the strain H3 than to Miass519, while segment 2 of the strain Miass519 was closer to .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/862573 doi: bioRxiv preprint the isolate JMTV/I.ricinus/France then to Miass527. This data suggests that reassortment of genome segments within ALSV could occur. Similar observations were made earlier for JMTV (Qin et al., 2014) .Chinese strains of ALSV were isolated from mammalian blood samples using Vero (African green monkey) cells (Wang et al., 2019a (Wang et al., , 2019b Previously, it was shown that the virion sizes of JMTV group representatives ranged from 30-35 nm to 70-100 nm (Ladner et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019a) . ALSV virions were reported to be enveloped spherical (or nearly spherical) particles with a diameter of approximately 80-100 nm (Wang et al., 2019a) . The size of virions of our strain Miass527 was 40.5±3.7 nm. In transmission electron microscopy, some of the viral particles had electron-dense cores, and could hypothetically be defective virions without genomic RNA (Korboukh et al., 2014) . In addition, we found smaller particles with a diameter of 13.1±2.1 nm, which had either electron-translucent or electron-dense cores. Presumably, they could represent either: a) glycoprotein aggregates, similar to the ""classic"" flavivirus nonstructural protein 1, which is i.e., slightly larger than the small particles that we saw in the same fraction of Miass527-infected .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/862573 doi: bioRxiv preprint cells. In any case, the particles were smaller than the smallest parvovirus virions with a diameter of 18-26 nm (Mi et al., 2019) . Further investigations are needed to clarify the nature of these particles.Although the strain Miass527 of ALSV did not differ in overall genome structure from the previously isolated ALSV (Wang et al., 2019a) , the newly-obtained data allowed us to propose a novel protein encoded by both ALSV and JMTV and, probably, by some other members of the JMTV group. The nuORF, proposed here, is conserved in all the full segment 2 sequences of ALSV, JMTV and Yanngou virus available at the time of writing. Considering that ALSV and JMTV are somewhat distantly related (around 70% nucleotide identity and around In conclusion, we isolated three strains of ALSV from I. persulcatus ticks in Russia.Although these strains were isolated from territories far from each other, in phylogenetic analysis they formed a single monophyletic group with the virus isolated in China. Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. Availability of these novel ALSV strains has enabled better understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within the JMTV group, and will facilitate further study of the origins, structure, replication, .

Collection and Processing of Ticks

In 2014, from the beginning of May to the middle of June, unfed adult ticks were collected by flagging from vegetation in the Republic of Karelia and Chelyabinsk region (Supplementary file 1). Ticks were identified using taxonomic keys (Filippova, 1997 (Filippova, , 1977 .Adult ticks were homogenised in pools of 3-5 individuals according to species composition, location, and route of collection using the laboratory homogeniser TissueLyser II (QIAGEN, Germany) in Medium 199 supplemented with Earle's salts (FSBSI Chumakov FSC R&D IBP RAS, Russia) and antibiotics. All homogenates were tested for the presence of flavivirus RNA using a heminested RT-PCR and primers targeting a conserved region of the flavivirus NS5 gene, as described earlier (Scaramozzino et al., 2001) .

Infection of Tick Cell Line

We used a cell line derived from embryos of the tick I. ricinus − IRE/CTVM19 (Bell-Sakyi et al., 2007) provided by the Tick Cell Biobank. The tick cell line was maintained at 28 °С in L-15 (Leibovitz) medium (FSBSI Chumakov FSC R&D IBP RAS, Russia) supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics as described earlier (Weisheit et al., 2015) . Prior to infection, IRE/CTVM19 cells were seeded in flat-sided culture tubes (Nunc, ThermoFisher Scientific) in 2.2 ml of complete medium and incubated at 28 °C. A week later, cells were infected by adding 200 μ l of virus-containing material (unfiltered tick homogenate or culture supernate) and incubated at 28 °С. Medium was changed at fortnightly intervals by removal and replacement of 1.5 ml; the spent medium was used to harvest the virus as described below. Occasional subcultures were carried out at intervals between 1 month and >1 year by adding 2.2ml of fresh medium, resuspending the tick cells and transferring half of the cell suspension to a new culture tube.For transmission electron microscopy and high-throughput sequencing, infected cell culture supernate (spent medium) was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C using an SW-28 rotor in an Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, USA) and was then ultracentrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 6 h at 4 °C using the same rotor. Uninfected cell culture supernate was prepared similarly for transmission electron microscopy..

Reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Sequencing of Amplified Products

Viral RNA from tick suspensions and culture supernate of infected cells was isolated with TRI Reagent LS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamer primers (R6) and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Viral genomic cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific primers MiassF and MiassR (Supplementary file 2) .Sequencing was carried out in both directions directly from PCR-amplified DNA on the ABI PRISM 3730 (Applied Biosystems) sequencer using ABI PRISM® BigDye™ Terminator v. 3.1.Genomic sequences were assembled using SeqMan software (DNAstar, USA).

High-Throughput Sequencing

Total RNA from an ultracentrifugation pellet was fragmented and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with R6 primers using RevertAid reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific) followed by second strand synthesis with the NEBNext Ultra II Non-Directional RNA Second Strand Synthesis Module (New England Biolabs Inc. USA). Resultant double-stranded DNA was purified using Ampure XP (Beckman Coulter) and subjected as an input for library preparation process using the NEBNext® Fast DNA Library Prep Set for Ion Torrent™ (New England Biolabs Inc. USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant DNA library was quantified with the Ion Library TaqMan™ Quantitation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) followed by templating on the Ion Chef instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific) and sequencing on the Ion .

Raw reads were quality-controlled using FaQCs v2.09 (Lo and Chain, 2014) and assembled into contigs using SPAdes v3.13.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) with iontorrent flag. The resultant contigs were screened for viral sequences using Blastn algorithm in BLAST v2.9.0+ with nt database and contigs corresponding to virus were extracted for further investigation.

Phylogenetic Analysis

RNA sequences of all published strains of ALSV, representatives of the JMTV group and the three strains described in this article were used in the phylogenetic analysis. The nucleotide sequences of the genome coding region of segment 2 were aligned using Clustal-X 2.0.11. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the neighbour-joining method using MEGA 6.0 with 1000 bootstrap replications.

Bioinformatics tools used for discovery of overlapping elements

For the analysis we used sequences of the full segment 2 of ALSV, JMTV and Yanggou virus extracted from GenBank (08.11.19), as well as sequences of the ALSV strains obtained in the present study (Supplementary file 9). Sequences were divided into three groups (named ""JMTV"", ""ALSV"" and Yanggou virus) based on their positions in the phylogenetic tree (Supplementary file 10). Sequences obtained in the current study were included in the ALSV alignment.Analyses of Yanggou virus, ALSV and JMTV were performed separately, because of a low level of similarity between them. Nucleotide sequences of the ORF VP1a (in the case of ALSV and Yanggou virus) and VP1 (in the case of JMTV) were extracted from the full segments. The resultant sequences were codon-aligned using the online tool «Codon Alignment v2.1.0» (available at https://hcv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/CodonAlign/codonalign.html) with default parameters. The resultant codon alignments were used as an input for the Synplot2 (Firth, 2014) online tool (available at http://guinevere.otago.ac.nz/cgi-bin/aef/synplot_c.pl) v. 2014-12-05/03:10:08 with default parameters (no reference sequence, n=12 (sliding window of 25 codons)).

"Abstract

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) is a member of the family coronaviridae and contains a single-stranded RNA genome with positive-polarity. To reveal the evolution mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 -4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure. Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection. Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.

","Introduction

SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV, is a novel coronavirus (CoVs) isolated from patients with pneumonia in China 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has a similar incubation period (median, 3.0 days) and a relatively lower fatality rate than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (1), but it is estimated that the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of SARS-CoV (2) .What's more, some laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases are absent of apparent cough, fever or radiologic manifestations, making it difficult to timely and accurately find out all infected patients (3, 4) . As of February 28, 2020, patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 have been diagnosed in more than 30 countries, and more than 78,000 confirmed cases and 2,700 deaths associate with SARS-CoV-2 infection are reported in China alone.The genetic information of a virus is essential for not only its classification and traceability, but also its pathogenicity. At the whole genome level, the sequence identify of SARS-CoV-2 was 50% to MERS-CoV, 79% to SARS-CoV, 88% to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, China) , and 96% to Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 (collected in 2013 in Yunnan, China) (5) . Each genome of all SARS-CoV-2 strains now submitted online contains nearly 29,900 nucleotides (nt), which are predicted with at least 14 open reading frames (ORFs) (5′ to 3′), such as ORF1ab (P, 21,291 nt), spike (S, 3,822 nt), ORF3a (8,28 nt), envelope (E, 228 nt), membrane (M, 669nt), ORF8 (366 nt), and nucleocapsid (N,1,260 nt) (6) . Among them, the spike gene encoded a glycoprotein that is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity, and highly divergent when compared with that of bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 (93.1% nucleotide identity) (6, 7) .Generally, the rates of nucleotide substitution of RNA viruses are faster than their hosts, and .

Gene mutations such as nucleotide substitutions, deletions and insertions have been frequently reported when comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other viruses (5) (6) (7) . In this work, we investigated the mutation pattern of SARS-CoV-2 by comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of the nonsynonymous/ synonymous substitution, relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and selective pressure in order to explore their potential in evolution and function.

Sequence data

The SARS-CoV-2 reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512) and WIV04 (MN996528) was downloaded from the GenBank database. Other newly sequenced 2019-nCoV genomes were downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database (https://www.gisaid.org/). Twenty-one closely related coronavirus complete genome sequences and their coding sequences (CDS) were downloaded from GenBank database (Supplementary   Table S1 ).

Phylogenetic analysis

Genome sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31 (9), followed by manual adjustment using BioEdit v7.2.5. Phylogenetic analyses of complete genome were performed using maximum-likelihood method and general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution with gamma-distributed rates among sites (GTR+G) in RAxML v8.1.21 (10) . Support for the inferred relationships was evaluated by a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates and trees were rooted with the alpha-coronavirus lineage as an outgroup. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.969006 doi: bioRxiv preprintThe coding sequences were translated and aligned using the MEGA-X program (11) , and then codon-based sequence alignment was used for further analysis. Phylogenetic analyses of coding sequences were performed using MEGA-X software. The changes of amino acids or nucleotides for each CDS sequences were analyzed using in-house Perl script.

Estimation of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates

The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS), and the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN), for each coding region were calculated using the Nei-Gojobori method (Jukes-Cantor) in PAML package (12) .The adaptive evolution server (http://www.datamonkey.org/) was used to identify eventual sites of positive selection. For this purpose, the following test has been used: mixed-effects model of evolution (MEME), which allows the distribution of dN/dS (ω) to vary from site to site and from branch to branch at a site (13) . This test allowed us to infer episodic and pervasive positive selection at individual sites.

Synonymous Codon Usage Analysis

To investigate the potential relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related coronaviruses, the coding sequence (CDS) of spike protein in these coronaviruses were calculated with CodonW 1.4.4 (http://codonw.sourceforge.net/). The RSCU of human genes was retrieved from the Codon Usage Database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/). The potential relationships among these sequences were calculated with a squared Euclidean distance ( u h u ). Besides RSCU, the effective number of codons (ENc) was used as a simple metrics to verify codon bias and to explore the source of virus.. CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical package (version 3.

2.2). The

Chi-squared test was used to compare any two data sets, and data were considered significantly different if the two-tailed p value was less than 0.05.

The mutation pattern between SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related coronaviruses

The newly identified SARS-CoV-2 strain WIV04 genome sequence was closely related with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45, which was collected from host Rhinolophus affinis (5) . Compared with RaTG13 genome, many nucleotide substitutions are observed, but there are only five small inserts and deletions (indels) mutations, and the largest insert segment in WIV04 genome was "" CGGCGGGCACGT "" sequence, which is located near the boundary of S1 and S2 regions of spike protein. Interestingly, only synonymous mutation are observed near this insertion sequence (Fig. 1 , panel C). Compared with Bat-SL-CoVZC45 genome, this insert segment is detected as well, but non-synonymous mutations are also observed around it. Then, we further compared the proportion of synonymous mutations in spike gene between WIV04 and RaTG13 or Bat-SL-CoVZC45. The ratio of nucleotide substitutions (263 NT) to amino acid substitutions (29 AA) was 9.07 from WIV04 to RaTG13, which was significantly higher than the ratio (3.91, 864/221) from WIV04 to Bat-SL-CoVZC45 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2) . Moreover, we also observed that the synonymous mutations increased in whole genome level between WIV04 and RaTG13 than that between WIV04 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45.Next, the detailed nucleotide changes of each comparison group were analyzed, and we found that the T-to-C (T:C) transition mutation was enriched in the nucleotide substitutions between WIV04 and RaTG13 (Fig. 1B) . It's reported that the CoVs lacking a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) accumulated 15 to 20 fold more A:G and U:C transition (14) . What's more, the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment will also increase the U:C and A:G transitions. Consequently, this increased T:C mutation implies the ExoN of SARS-CoV-2 may be deactivated compared with that of RaTG13. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.969006 doi: bioRxiv preprint Furthermore, we checked whether the ratio of synonymous substitution to missense substitution is increased within SARS-CoV-2 strains. From December 2019 to February 2020, the genome sequences of 108 strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus have been submitted to GISAID database worldwide. Compared with the standard SARS-CoV-2 strain WIV04, total 98 point mutations were detected at 93 nucleotide sites of all SARS-CoV-2 strains with genome sequence available on Feb. 25 2020 (Fig. 1A) . However, only 58 of these nucleotide mutations caused changes in amino acids. Among them, 15 nucleotide substitutions at 14 sites caused changes in 7 amino acids of the spike protein were observed. Consequently, the proportion of synonymous mutations (~40%) among all current reported SARS-CoV-2 strains is similar to that between WIV04 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45 (39.1%), but is dramatically less than that between WIV04 and RaTG13 (90.7%).According to random drift hypothesis (15) ， these nucleotide mutations among different SARS-CoV-2 strains now available are still determined by neutral evolution. In short, there has no powerful factor to force SARS-CoV-2 to evolve in a certain direction by far. However, we should take strict precautions against the strong factors that may cause directional variation of SARS-CoV-2 both in natural environment and infection treatment.

The mutation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 was unique across coronavirus species

To investigate whether the mutation pattern between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is unique across all coronavirus species, we further compared their alterations of nucleotides and amino acids in comparison to other representative coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and its 20 closely related coronaviruses formed four well supported clades (Fig. 2) . The two SARS-CoV-2 strain WIV04 (from Wuhan) and SNU01 (from Korea patient) were clustered with SARS-CoV-related strains to form clade 1, belonging to beta-coronavirus lineage B. The Compared with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, there were 293 nucleotideswere altered while only 29 amino acids were altered in SARS-CoV-2; their ratio was as high as 9.07. However, this ratio detected in the comparisons of other human coronaviruses with their similar animal coronaviruses was less than 5.0. For example, the ratio of human SARS-CoV Tor2 to bat SARS-like CoVs LYRa11 was 4.81; that ratio of human MERS-CoV EMC2012 to bat SARS-like CoVs RSA2011 was 2.80; that ratio of human coronavirus 229E to bat coronavirus HKU2 was 4.55. These results indicate that the relative level of synonymous substitutions between human SARS-CoV-2 and its possible animal origin (RaTG13) is much higher than that between other human coronaviruses and their potential animal sources.

Codon usage has small impact on the mutation pattern between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13

Different organisms, even different protein coding genes of the same species, have different frequency of codon usage (16) . The RSCU bias will reveal the difference of the host source. We calculated the distance of RSCU between spike genes of 20 representative coronaviruses and

SARS-COV-2. The codon usage difference (distance of RSCU) of between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04

and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was 1.17, which was the lowest except for SNU01 (another strain of SARS-CoV-2), indicating that their codon preference was almost the same; the second lowest codon usage difference was 2.41 that was detected between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45 (Fig. 2) . The coronaviruses in same beta-CoV lineage B have a relatively close 

The nucleotide substitutions between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 was affected by stronger purifying selection

To infer whether the retention of synonymous mutations is supported or hindered by natural selection, we further studied non-synonymous substitution rate (dN) and synonymous substitution rate (dS) in spike gene (Table 1) . Generally, positive (Darwinian) selection increases, but negative (purifying) selection decreases the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS). The results showed that both dN and dS of S gene of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 versus Bat-SARr-CoV RaTG13 were the lowest among all typical coronaviruses, while those of SARS-CoV Tor2 versus bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1 were the second lowest. When the ratio of dN to dS of spike gene is compared, all the tested dN/dS are less than 1, indicating that these non-synonymous mutations are harmful, and negative selection will reduce their retention speed.

Moreover, dN/dS rate of polyprotein (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid (N) genes were similar with that of spike gene (Table   S2 ).The spike (S) protein undergoes several drastic changes during virus infection. For instance, its large parts are cleaved during infection by cellular proteases and expose the receptors to activate viral attachment to the host (17) . As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein was involved in interacting with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, the RBD region was thought to be preferential targets of natural selection (18) . Consistent with this hypothesis, our results showed that both dN and dS of RBD region are increased in comparison with whole spike gene region across all the virus pairs used in this study (Table 1) . Notably, the dN/dS ratio of RBD region in SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 was dramatically increased in about 3 fold in comparison with full spike region. Consequently, these mutations may be subjected to Darwin's choice and will become evidence of adaptive protein evolution.To detect positive selection on the spike gene, the MEME analysis was performed.Significant (p < 0.05) pervasive episodic selection was detected in three sites (48th, 254th, 330th position using the reference sequence of WIV04). On the 254th position of the spike amino acid sequence, there is a histidine residue instead of a phenylalanine residue, whereas on the 330th amino acidic position in WIV04 sequence, there is a glutamine residue instead of an valine residue.The results described above strongly supporting the action of positive selection in spike gene during the recent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.

Conclusions

Through comprehensive comparative analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we found the synonymous mutations is dramatically elevated between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 than that of other coronavirus strains, and the nucleotide mutations were enriched in T:C transition.The specific mutation pattern may caused by the loss function of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN). Moreover, as the SARS-CoV-2 was supposed to be originated from Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the increased synonymous substitution between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strain suggested the SARS-CoV-2 genome was under stronger negative (purifying) selection. We also detected some sites in spike protein was experiencing positive selection. These observations suggest that adaptive evolution might contribute to its host shifts. However, as the RNA mutagen (e.g. 5-FU) could induce the same mutation pattern, the mechanism of the mutation pattern observed between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 should be further investigated in future work.

"Abstract

Aims: Studies have indicated that chloroquine (CQ) shows antagonism against COVID-19 in vitro.

","Introduction

Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and are broadly distributed in humans and other vertebrates, eventually causing damage in digestive, respiratory and even multiple systems. In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology appeared in Wuhan, Hubei, China [1] . Sequencing analysis of throat swabs samples and electron microscope observations indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named SARS-CoV-2 (formerly known as 2019-nCoV) [2] . Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to have obvious human-to-human characteristics [3, 4] . As of March 20, 2020, more than two hundred thousand confirmed cases have been identified globally, for a total of 8778 deaths [5] .As the epidemic is spreading to many countries, COVID-19 poses a severe threat to global health [6] . Therefore, it is urgent to develop effective drugs against COVID-19.The recent publication of results showing the activity of chloroquine (CQ) against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [7] , some experts and researchers also have been recommended the efficacy of this antimalarial drug in patients with 9] . For this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been working to investigate the use of CQ in COVID-19 [10] . As a derivative of CQ, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has similar therapeutic effects and fewer adverse effects. Based on its characteristics of immunity regulation, antithrombotic activity, and inflammation improvement, HCQ has been routinely used in the clinical treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [11] . However, .

In addition, among the 178 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital, none were receiving HCQ treatment before admission. All predicting the use of HCQ in SARS-CoV-2 infections. As one of the clinical research registration units in China, we aimed to investigate the efficiency of HCQ in patients with COVID-19 in this study.

Randomization was performed through a computer-generated list stratified by site. Treatments were assigned after confirming the correctness of the admission criteria. Neither the research performers nor the patients were aware of the treatment assignments. Pulmonary recovery is defined as three levels: exacerbated, unchanged, and improved, moderately improved when less than 50 % of pneumonia were absorbed, and more than 50 % means significantly improved.

Statistical Analysis

Data were described as the mean (standard deviation, SD), n (%), the t-test or χ ² test was used to compare the differences between the two groups. A two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism, version 6.0.

Results

62 patients were identified as having COVID-19 and enrolled in this study, none quit ( Figure 1 ). As shown in Table 1 , For all patients, the age was 44.7 (15.3) years old, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups. There was no significant difference in the age and sex distribution between the two groups of patients, but there are .

The data in this study revealed that after 5 days of HCQ treatment, the symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were significantly relieved, manifesting as shorten in the recovery time for cough and fever. At the same time, a larger proportion of patients with pulmonary inflammatory has been partially absorbed in the HCQ treatment group, indicating the immune modulation and anti-inflammatory properties of HCQ in non-malarial diseases [17] . At present, the multiple actions of HCQ such as regulation in pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g.Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-1 (IL-6)], antioxidant activities, also promote it widely performed in rheumatic diseases such as SLE [11, 17] . According to current research, a higher pro-inflammatory cytokine storm existed in COVID-19 patients with a severe or critical illness, eventually affected the prognosis [18] . For this, IL-6 antibody blocker, transfusion of convalescent plasma, and other therapies have been applied to counteract the cytokine storm [19, 20] . Therefore, with antiviral and autoimmune regulation effects, HCQ should be a protector in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, the reduced risk of progression to severe illness in patients with HCQ treatment also explained the intervention effect of HCQ on the pathological process of the COVID-19.Although HCQ has proven to be effective, with advantages of inexpensive and easily accessible, its potential detrimental effects in viral diseases must also be taken seriously. Retinopathy is one of the major adverse reactions of long-term therapy with HCQ [21] . Besides, patients with rheumatoid diseases treated with HCQ occasionally experience arrhythmias [22] . Other rare adverse reactions caused by HCQ include gastrointestinal reactions, cramps, liver dysfunction, itching, headache, dizziness, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy [13] . Fortunately, deciding on individual treatment plans scientifically, monitoring adverse reactions timely, to avoid overdose, short-term application of HCQ is relatively safe.

Conclusion

Despite our small number of cases, the potential of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 has been partially confirmed. Considering that there is no better option at present, it is a promising practice to apply HCQ to COVID-19 under reasonable management. However, Large-scale clinical and basic research is still needed to clarify its specific mechanism and to continuously optimize the treatment plan..

"Abstract

The present outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections, including respiratory distress syndrome, is the third spillover, in only two decades, of an animal coronavirus to humans resulting in a major epidemic. Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location. The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined. The independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying the entire (virus) species to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This research will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks. : bioRxiv preprint Defining novelty and the place of SARS-CoV-2 within the taxonomy of the Coronaviridae family During the 21 st century, researchers studying coronaviruses -a family of enveloped positivestranded RNA viruses of vertebrates 8 -were confronted several times with the question of coronavirus novelty, including two times when a severe or even life-threatening disease was introduced into humans from a zoonotic reservoir: this happened with severe acute respiratory

","Is the human coronavirus that emerged in Asia in December 2019 novel?

Is the outbreak of an infectious disease caused by a new or a previously known virus (Box 1)? This is among the first and principal questions because the answer informs measures to detect the causative agent, control its transmission and limit potential consequences of the epidemic. It also has implications for the virus name. On a different time scale, the answer also helps to define research priorities in virology and public health.The questions of virus novelty and naming are now posed in relation to a coronavirus causing an outbreak of a respiratory syndrome that was first detected in Wuhan, China, December 2019. It was temporally named 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV. The term ""novel"" may refer to the disease (or spectrum of clinical manifestations) that is caused in humans infected by this particular virus, which, however, is only emerging and requires further studies 1,2 . The term ""novel"" in the name of 2019-nCoV may also refer to an incomplete match between the genomes of this and other (previously known) coronaviruses, if the latter was considered an appropriate criterion for defining ""novelty"". However, virologists agree that neither the disease nor the host range can be used to reliably ascertain virus novelty (or identity), since few genome changes may attenuate a deadly virus or cause a host switch 3 . Likewise, we know that RNA viruses persist as a swarm of co-evolving closely related entities (variants of a defined sequence, haplotypes), known as quasispecies 4, 5 . Their genome sequence is a consensus snapshot of a constantly evolving cooperative population in vivo and may vary within a single infected person 6 and over time in an outbreak 7 . If the strict match criterion of novelty was to be applied to RNA viruses, it would have qualified every virus with a sequenced genome as a novel virus, which makes this criterion poorly informative. To get around the potential problem, virologists instead may regard two viruses with non-identical but similar genome sequences as variants of the same virus; this immediately poses the question of how much difference is large enough to recognize the candidate virus as novel or distinct? This question is answered in best practice by evaluating the degree of relatedness of the candidate virus to previously known viruses of the same host or established monophyletic groups of viruses, often known as genotypes or clades, which may or may not include viruses of different hosts. This is formally addressed in the framework of virus taxonomy (Box 2).In this study, we present an assessment of the novelty of 2019-nCoV and detail the basis for (re)naming this virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, which will be used hereafter. syndrome (SARS) [9] [10] [11] [12] and, a few years later, with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 13, 14 . Each time, the pathogen was initially called a new human coronavirus, as was the case with SARS-CoV-2 during the current outbreak, every time the issue was resolved by the sequencebased family classification.The current classification of coronaviruses includes taxa at eight out of the fifteen available ranks 15 , and it recognizes forty-nine species in twenty-seven subgenera, five genera and two subfamilies that belong to the family Coronaviridae, suborder Cornidovirineae, order Nidovirales, realm Riboviria [16] [17] [18] . The family classification and taxa naming (taxonomy) are developed by the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG), a working group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 19 . The CSG has responsibility in assessing the novelty of viruses through their relation to known viruses in established taxa and, for the purpose of this paper, specifically in the context of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus.To appreciate the difference between Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and SARS-CoV, i.e. between species and virus, it may be instructive to look at their relation in the context of the full taxonomy structure of several coronaviruses and in comparison with the taxonomy of the virus host, specifically humans ( Fig. 1) . Thus, SARS-CoV-Urbani with a particular genome sequence 20 could be regarded as equivalent to a single human being, while the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus would be on a par with the species Homo sapiens. This parallel could go beyond semantics and be biologically meaningful because of how coronaviruses are assigned to species in practice, although the extension of this concept to virology is yet to be developed and thoroughly tested 21 .Even without knowing anything on the species concept of classifying different forms of life, every human recognizes another human as being a member of the (same) species Homo sapiens. However, for assigning individual living organisms to most other species, specialized knowledge and tools for assessing inter-individual differences are required. The CSG uses a computational framework of comparative genomics 22 that is shared by several Study Groups concerned with the classification and nomenclature of the order Nidovirales and coordinated by the Nidovirales Study Group 23 (Box 3). The Study Groups quantify and partition the variation in the most conserved replicative proteins encoded in open reading frames 1a and 1b (ORF1a/1b) of the coronavirus genome ( Fig. 2A) to identify thresholds on pair-wise patristic distances (PPD) that demarcate virus clusters at different ranks.SARS-CoV-2 clusters with SARS-CoVs in trees of the species Severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus (Fig. 2B ) and genus Betacoronavirus (Fig. 2C) , as was also reported by others [24] [25] [26] . Distance estimates between SARS-CoV-2 and the most closely related coronaviruses vary among different studies, depending on the choice of measure (nucleotide or amino acid) and genome region. Accordingly, researchers are split about the exact taxonomic position of 2019-nCoV (i.e., SARS-CoV-2). When we included SARS-CoV-2 in the dataset, including 2505 coronaviruses and used for the most recent update (May 2019) of the coronavirus taxonomy that is currently being considered by ICTV 18 , the species composition was not affected and the virus was assigned to the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, as detailed below. The species demarcation threshold/limit in the family Coronaviridae is defined/imposed by viruses whose PPD may cross the inter-species demarcation threshold. Due to their minute share of ~10 -4 of the total number of all intra-and inter-species PPDs, they may not even be visually recognized in a conventional diagonal plot clustering viruses on species basis (Fig. 3A) . Furthermore, these violators do not involve any virus of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus species, as evident from the analysis of maximal intraspecies PPDs of 2505 viruses of all 49 coronavirus species (Fig. 3B) and PDs of 256 viruses of this species (Fig. 4) . Thus, the genomic variation of the known viruses of this species is smaller compared to that of other comparably well sampled species, e.g. those prototyped by MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and IBV (Fig. 3B) , and this species is well separated from other known coronavirus species in the sequence space. Both these characteristics of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus facilitate the unambiguous species assignment of SARS-CoV-2 to this species.Intra-species PDs of SARS-CoV-2 belong to the top 25% of this species and also include the largest PD, that between SARS-CoV-2 and an African bat virus isolate (SARSr-CoV_BtKY72) 27 ( Fig. 4) , representing two basal lineages within the species Severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus that constitute very few known viruses (Fig. 2BC) . These relationships stand in contrast to the shallow branching of the most populous lineage of this species which includes all the human SARS-CoV isolates collected during the 2002-2003 outbreak and the closely related bat viruses of Asian origin identified in the search for the potential zoonotic source of that epidemic 28 . (Note that this clade structure is susceptible to homologous recombination, which is common in this species 29 28,30 ; to formalize clade definition, it must be revisited after the virus sampling of the deep branches was improved sufficiently). The current sampling defines a very small median PD for human SARS-CoVs, which is approximately 15 times smaller than the median PD determined for SARS-CoV-2 (0.16% vs 2.6%, Fig. 4 ). This small median PD of human SARS-CoVs also dominates the species-wide PD distribution (0.25%, Fig. 4) . Along with the initial failure to detect the causative agent of the disease using SARS-CoV-specific PCR setups, the separation from SARS-CoV in the phylogeny and the PD space explains why 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) may be considered a novel virus by many researchers.Designating 2019-nCoV as SARS-CoV-2 and providing guidance for naming its variantsThe above results show that, in terms of taxonomy, SARS-CoV-2 is (just) another virus in the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. In this respect, the discovery of this virus differs considerably from the description of the two other zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, introduced to humans in the 21 st century (Fig. 5A ). Both these viruses were considered novel by this study group based on prototyping two species and two informal . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Due to being first, these viruses and their taxa were assigned new names whose origins reflected the practice and the state of virus taxonomy at the respective times ( Fig. 5B ) (Box 4). Neither of these circumstances are applicable to SARS-CoV-2, which is assigned to an existing species of hundreds of known viruses predominantly isolated from humans and diverse bats. All these viruses have names derived from SARS-CoV (directly or through the species name), even though only the human isolates collected during the 2002-2003 outbreak have been confirmed to cause SARS in infected individuals. Thus, the reference to SARS in all these virus names (combined with the use of specific prefixes, suffixes and/or genome sequence IDs in public databases) acknowledges the phylogenetic grouping of the respective virus with viruses isolated from SARS patients, for example SARS-CoV-Urbani, rather than linking this virus to a specific disease (i.e., SARS) in humans. Based on the established practice of virus naming in this species and the relatively distant relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to the prototype SARS-CoV in a species tree and the distance space (Figs. 2B, and 4), the CSG renames 2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV-2.In contrast to SARS-CoV, the name SARS-CoV-2 has NOT been derived from the name of the SARS disease (Fig. 5B) , and in no way, it should be used to predefine the name of the disease (or spectrum of diseases) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which will be decided upon by the WHO. The available yet limited epidemiological and clinical data for SARS-CoV-2 suggest that the disease spectrum, and transmission modes of this virus and SARS-CoV may differ 1 . Also, the diagnostic methods used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infections are not identical to those of SARS-CoV. This is reflected by the specific recommendations for public health practitioners, healthcare workers and laboratory diagnostic staff for SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV (e.g. WHO guidelines for 2019-nCoV; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). By uncoupling the naming conventions used for coronaviruses and the diseases they may cause in humans and animals, we wish to help the WHO with naming diseases in the most appropriate way (WHO guidelines for disease naming; https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/163636) (Fig. 5B) .To facilitate good practice and scientific exchange, the CSG recommends that researchers describing new isolates of this virus and other viruses in this species adopt a standardized format for public databases and publications. The proposed naming convention includes a reference to the host organism that the virus was isolated from, the time of isolation, and the place of isolation (geographic location): Virus/Isolate/Host/Date/Location, e.g. SARS-CoV-2/X1/Human/2019/Wuhan. This complete designation along with additional and important characteristics, such as association with pathogenicity in humans or other hosts, should be included in the submission of each isolate genome sequence to public databases, e.g. GenBank.In publications, this name could be further extended with a sequence database ID, e.g. SARS-CoV-2/X1/Human/2019/Wuhan_XYZ12345, when first mentioned in the text. We believe that this format will inform about the major characteristics of each particular virus isolate (genome . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Concluding remarks: from focusing on pathogens to understanding virus species

Historically, public health and fundamental research have been focused on the detection, containment, treatment and analysis of viruses that are pathogenic to humans, with little regard to exploring and defining their genetic diversity and biological characteristics as a species. In this framework, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a human pathogen in December 2019 may be perceived as completely independent from the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003. Although SARS-CoV-2 is NOT a descendent of SARS-CoV (Fig. 2B ) and the introduction of each of these viruses into humans was likely facilitated by unknown external factors, the two viruses are genetically so close to each other (Fig. 2C ) that their evolutionary histories and characteristics are mutually informative. Our understanding of these pathogens could be significantly advanced if both viruses were characterized along with viruses of other origins, known and yet-to-be discovered 25 , as part of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus species, with the long-term goal of comprehending the biology and evolution of that species, as is the norm elsewhere in biology. To connect this development to health care, diagnostic tools that target the entire species should complement existing tools that detect individual pathogenic variants.Although this paper focuses on a single virus species, the raised issues concern other species in the family and possibly beyond. As a first step toward appreciation of this species and its cousins, researchers, journals, databases, and other relevant bodies should adopt proper referencing to the full taxonomy of coronaviruses under study. This includes that the relevant virus species is explicitly acknowledged along with the viruses included in this species by following the ICTV naming rules (Box 4) which, regretfully, are rarely observed in common practice, contributing to the proliferation of mixing viruses and species in the literature (and the authors of this paper wish to acknowledge that they were also not immune to this problem in several cases). This necessary adjustment may be facilitated by the major revision of the virus species nomenclature that is currently being discussed by ICTV and planned to be implemented in the near future 33 . With this change in place, the CSG is resolved to address the existing significant overlap between virus and species names that complicates the appreciation and use of the species concept in its application to coronaviruses.

Box 1. Virus Discovery: from disease-based to phenotype-free

Understanding the cause of a specific disease that spreads among individuals of the same biological species (infectivity) was the major driving force for the discovery of the first virus, initially in plants, and many others in all types of life, including humans. The range of diseases and hosts that specific viruses were confirmed to be associated with have been the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.937862 doi: bioRxiv preprint two key and most appreciated characteristics used to define viruses that are invisible to the naked eye due to their minute size 34 . They belong to the so-called phenotype of viruses, which includes those that -like a disease -are shaped by virus-host interactions, e.g. transmission rate or immune correlates of protection, and others that are virus-specific, e.g. the architecture of virus particles. These phenotypic features are of critical importance for many decisions and actions related to medically and economically important viruses, especially during outbreaks of severe infectious diseases, and they dominate the general perception of viruses.However, the host is not definitive nor is the pathogenicity known for a major (and fast growing) share of viruses, including many coronaviruses discovered in metagenomics studies using next generation sequencing technology 35, 36 . These studies analyze diverse environmental specimens and assemble genomic sequence of viruses, which circulate in nature and have never been characterized on the phenotypic level. Thus, the genome sequence is the only characteristic that is known for the vast majority of viruses, and its use in defining virus identity in the virosphere is the only available choice going forward. In this framework, a virus is defined by its genome sequence that instructs the synthesis of polynucleotide molecules capable of autonomous replication inside cells and dissemination between cells or organisms under appropriate conditions. It may or may not be harmful to its natural host. Experimental studies may be performed for a fraction of known viruses, while computational comparative genomics is used to classify (and deduce characteristics of) all viruses.

Box 2. Recognizing virus novelty

Besides haplotypes of a virus quasispecies, the terms strains and isolates are in common use to refer to virus variants with larger genome variations, although there are different opinions as to which term should be used in a specific context. If a candidate virus clusters within a group of isolates, it is a variant of this group and, in other words, may be considered a known virus. On the other hand, if the candidate virus is outside of known groups and its distances to viruses of these groups are comparable to those observed between viruses of different groups (intergroup distances), the candidate virus is distinct and could be considered novel. Commonly this evaluation is conducted in silico using phylogenetic analysis that may be complicated by uneven rates of evolution that vary across different virus lineages and genomic sites due to mutation, including exchange of genome regions in closely related viruses (homologous recombination). Comparative genomics forms also the basis for PCR assays that are suitable to detect established viruses and their groups in vitro. If such PCRs do not recognize the candidate virus, it may be considered novel. There are two caveats to the above approaches. Since the current sampling of viruses is small and highly biased toward viruses of significant medical and economic interest, the group composition varies tremendously among different viruses, making decisions on novelty group-specific and dependent on the choice of specific criteria selected by .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.937862 doi: bioRxiv preprint researchers. Practically, this means that definitive evidence for novelty in one group may not stand up to scrutiny in another.The challenges mentioned above are addressed specifically in the framework of virus taxonomy, which partitions genomic variation above strain/isolate level and develops a unique taxa nomenclature under the supervision of the ICTV 21, 37 . To decide on virus novelty, taxonomists use the results of different analyses, although comparative sequence analysis plays an increasing role and is now the primary tool in the classification of coronaviruses (Box 3). Taxonomical classification is hierarchical, using nested groups (taxa) that populate different levels (ranks) of classification. Taxa of different ranks differ in respect to intrataxon pairwise divergence, which increases from the smallest at the species rank to the largest at the realm rank. They may also be distinguished by taxon-specific markers that characterize natural groupings. When classifying a virus, researchers are required to define and name taxa only on the species and genus ranks while filling other ranks is optional. Thus, species is the smallest and mandatory unit of virus taxonomy. Only if a virus prototypes a new species, it will be regarded as truly novel, taxonomy-wise. Within this framework, a virus that crosses a host barrier and acquires novel properties remains part of the original species. This association may persist even after the virus established a permanent circulation in the new host, as it likely happened with coronaviruses of four species circulating in humans (reviewed in 38 ).

Box 3. Classifying coronaviruses

In the past, the classification of coronaviruses was largely based on serologic (cross-) reactivity involving the S protein till it became based on comparative sequence analysis of replicative proteins. The choice of proteins and the methods used to analyze them have gradually evolved since the start of this century 19, 31, 32, 39 . Currently, the CSG analyzes 3CLpro, NiRAN, RdRp, ZBD and HEL1 40 ( Fig. 2A) , which replaced the seven domains used for analysis between 2009 and 2015 17 . According to our current knowledge, these five most essential domains are the only domains that are conserved in all viruses of the order Nidovirales; they are used for the classification by all nidovirus SGs (coordinated by the NSG).Since 2011, the classification of coronaviruses and other nidoviruses has been assisted by the DEmARC (DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering) software which defines taxa and ranks 22 . Importantly, the involvement of all coronavirus genome sequences available at the time of analysis allows family-wide designations of demarcation criteria for all ranks, including species, regardless of the taxa sampling size, be it a single or hundreds of virus(es). DEmARC delineates monophyletic clusters (taxa) of viruses, using weighted linkage clustering in the pairwise patristic distance (PPD) space and according to the classification ranks defined through clustering cost (CC) minima presented as PPD thresholds. The persistence of thresholds in the face of increasing virus sampling is interpreted in the DEmARC framework as a reflection of biological forces and environmental factors 41 .. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.937862 doi: bioRxiv preprint Specifically, homologous recombination, which is common in coronaviruses [42] [43] [44] , is believed to be restricted in the most essential proteins, like those used for classification, to within a species. This restriction promotes intra-species diversity and contributes to inter-species separation; hence, they are biological entities, which deviates from the current ICTV definition of virus species as man-made constructs 21 . To facilitate the use of rank thresholds outside the DEmARC framework, they are converted into pair-wise differences (PD) %, which researchers commonly use to arrive at a tentative assignment of a given virus within the coronavirus taxonomy following conventional phylogenetic analysis of selected viruses.

Box 4. Naming Viruses and Virus Species: roles of ICTV and WHO

Besides humans and their pets, viruses may be the only biological entities that have names for virtually every single known representative, in addition to the groups (taxa) that together constitute the official classification of virus taxonomy. This exceptional treatment of viruses is a by-product of the historical perception of viruses as a feature of the diseases they cause (Box 1) and the way we usually catalogue and classify newly discovered viruses, rather than an expression of appreciation of virus individuality. Apart from disease, also geography and the organism a given virus was isolated from dominate the name vocabulary, occasionally engraving connections that may be accidental (rather than typical) to the virus in nature. Virus naming is linked to the recognition of virus novelty (Box 2), which is not formally regulated; and no national or global authorities have been established to certify virus novelty and approve virus names. Thus, it is mainly up to virus discoverers or other researchers to decide on these matters, and it is not uncommon to see two variants of the same virus having very different names, if they were described by different researchers.One of the priorities of the World Health Organization (WHO), an agency of the United Nations, is concerned with communicable diseases, including the coordination of international public health activities aimed at containing (and mitigating the consequences of) major virus epidemics. WHO also considers virus novelty and has responsibility in naming the disease(s) caused by newly emerging human viruses. By doing so, WHO often takes the traditional approach of linking viruses to specific diseases (Box 1) and assessing novelty by an apparent failure to detect the causative agent by established diagnostic assays. Formally, ICTV was involved in virus naming only until the grouping of the most closely related viruses into clusters (taxa species) was introduced and their nomenclature in the taxonomy established 45 . Since then, the specialized Study Groups have been involved in virus naming only on a case-by-case basis as an extension of their official remit and using the special expertise of their members. However, since the study groups are responsible for assigning viruses to virus species, they could play an important role in advancing the species concept (which is yet to be fully appreciated) to the research community and others, who may be uncertain about its significance 21 . The CSG adopts the DEmARC-based approach to define virus species (Box 3). Practically, virus species are often ignored or confused with viruses that are part of the respective species. This problem may be alleviated by strictly adhering to established rules for the naming of species and viruses in that species 33 . The The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.937862 doi: bioRxiv preprint species name is italicized, starts with a capital letter, and must NOT be spelled in an abbreviated form; neither of these rules and conventions apply to virus names, hence severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or SARS-CoV as it is widely known.

"Abstract

Three anti-HIV drugs, ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir, might have therapeutic effect on coronavirus disease 2019 . In this study, the structure models of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteases, coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30) and papain like viral protease (PLVP), were built by homology modeling. Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease-drug complexes. In the simulations, ritonavir can bind to CEP_C30 most suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; lopinavir can also bind to CEP_C30 suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; darunavir can bind to PLVP suitably with slight conformation changes of PLVP. It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP.author/funder.

","Introduction

In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, and then quickly became a rising global concern since World Health Organization had declared it as the sixth public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020. By the time of 14:50 on February 8, 2020, 34638 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed in China and 723 patients died from it, resulting in a mortality of 2.2%. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel species of non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus which can spread and distribute in humans and other mammals [1] . Previous studies have discovered that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a distinct clade from the β-coronavirus which is associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [2] . Shi ZL et al found that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-related coronavirus and is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus [3] , which corresponds to that the origin may be wild animals sold in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [4] . Recent clinical research found that dyspnea might occur on the fifth day and acute respiratory distress syndrome on the eighth day from first symptom of COVID-19 in median, organ dysfunction and death can also occur in severe COVID-19 cases [5, 6] . However, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19. Finding drugs that can fight against SARS-CoV-2 is a top priority.The trial fifth edition of diagnosis and treatment guideline of COVID-19 issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) recommends to use Kaletra for treatment. Kaletra, an anti-HIV drug which is composed of two protease inhibitors, ritonavir (CAS#: 155213-67-5) and lopinavir (CAS#: 192725-17-0), might have therapeutic effect on coronavirus diseases like SARS and MERS [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, whether it can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 or treat COVID-19 lacks clinical evidences and randomized clinical trials, and the safety of its use in COVID-19 patients is unclear. Otherwise, Lanjuan Li, infectious disease scientist, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, recommended darunavir (CAS#: 206361-99-1), also an HIV protease inhibitor, as a treatment for COVID-19. Although the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 has been verified in vitro, its therapeutic effect on COVID-19 is still unknown. At the same time, the mechanism of how these drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 is also unknown.As coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, synthesize polyproteins followed by hydrolyzed to produce their structure and function proteins [11] [12] [13] , it is suggested that ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir may block the multiplication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting its proteases. To preliminarily understand the inhibitory effects of the drugs, in this study, molecular models of the proteases were built by homology modeling, followed by docking the drugs to the proteases, respectively. In addition, the dynamic interactions between the drugs and the protease were also simulated to evaluate the binding effects of the drugs on the proteases.

Homology Modeling of the Proteases

The sequences of the found protease-like domains were then used to build molecular models by homology modeling through SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . To evaluate qualities, Verify score, Errat score, Prove score and Ramachandran plots of the built models were automatically created by Structure Analysis and Verification server (version 5.0, https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/).

Molecular Docking of the Drugs

To dock ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir to the proteases, respectively, Discovery Studio software (version 2.5, Accelrys Software Inc.) was used. While docking, one of the proteases would be set as receptor, and all its possible docking sites would be found. A sphere whose radius was 17 units would then be set at the optimal docking site, followed by semi-flexible docking of unprotonated ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir to the receptor protease through Dock Ligands (Libdock) module of Discovery Studio software, respectively. The preliminary docking results would be evaluated by Libdock scores and intermolecular interactions through Discovery Studio software.To analyze the structure changes of proteases caused by induced-fit effect after binding the drugs, Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient Algorithms were used to minimize the energy of the protease-drug complexes successively through Minimization module of Discovery Studio software. During calculation, fixed constraint of the backbone of proteins was used first and removed later.author/funder. All rights reserved.

Through docking drugs to this site, 100 poses were found when docking ritonavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 192.346; 88 poses were found when docking lopinavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 147.123; and 49 poses were found when docking darunavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 149.404. The optimal docking site of PLVP is a pocket in one side of the protein. Through docking drugs to this site, 4 poses were found when docking ritonavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 164.153; 3 poses were found when docking lopinavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 107.137; and 8 poses were found when docking darunavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 139.543. The interactions between the proteases and drugs at the optimal poses are shown in Figure 2 , and the structures of the docked protease-drug complexes at the optimal pose before energy minimization are available in Supplemental Files S3 to S8.Through energy minimization, all protease-drug complexes had some structure changes. The differences between before and after energy minimization of proteasedrug complexes are shown in Figure 3 , and the structures of protease-drug complexes after energy minimization are available in Supplemental Files S9 to S14.

Molecular Models of the Proteases

By searching the conserved domains of the sequence of orf1ab polyprotein, two protease-like domains were found. One domain is coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30), located from 3292 to 3569 of the polyprotein sequence; the other domain is papain like viral protease (PLVP), located from 1564 to 1880 of the sequence. The sequence of PLVP was directly used for subsequent homology modeling, while the 5 residues at the C-terminal of the sequence of CEP_C30 were deleted before subsequent homology modeling to minimize disordered structures.While modeling CEP_C30, 8 models were built according to 8 automatically found templates. The top-rated model in the 8 models is a homo-dimer with no ligand, and was selected to represent the structure of CEP_C30. While modeling PLVP, 29 models were built according to 16 automatically found templates. The top-rated model in the 29 models is a monomer with a zinc ion ligand, and was selected to represent the structure of PLVP. The structures of the two selected models are available in Supplemental Files S1 and S2. The detailed information, evaluation scores and Ramachandran plots of the two models are shown in Figure 1 .

The Significance of the Molecular Models

In this study, two models of two protease-like domains, CEP_C30 and PLVP, of orf1ab polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2 were built. Since these two models were built by taking highly homologous crystal structures as templates, their qualities are quite considerable. As it is difficult to obtain the crystal structure of CEP_C30 and PLVP in a short time, there is great significance to use these reliable structure models to predict their dynamic interactions with other molecules.

The Binding Effects of the Drugs

For ritonavir and lopinavir, these two drugs seem more suitable to bind to CEP_C30 rather than PLVP. Through energy minimization, it is suggested that after docking ritonavir or lopinavir, CEP_C30 can be induced to change its conformation significantly to bind the drug tightly. Moreover, ritonavir is more suitable than lopinavir to bind to CEP_C30. As shown in Figure 2 and 3, there are more interactions between CEP_C30 and ritonavir, and the binding between them is tighter. On the contrary, neither ritonavir nor lopinavir seems suitable to bind to PLVP, since the bindings become less tight after energy minimization.For darunavir, this drug seems more suitable to bind to PLVP rather than CEP_C30. Through energy minimization, it is suggested that after docking to PLVP, darunavir can change its conformation significantly to fit PLVP, whose conformation will also be induced to slightly change. On the contrary, darunavir seems not suitable to bind to CEP_C30, since the binding between darunavir and CEP_C30 becomes less tight after energy minimization.

The Possible Inhibitory Mechanisms of the Drugs

"Abstract

The detection of serum antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is emerging as a new tool for the coronavirus disease-2019 diagnosis. Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 ℃ prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples.

","Introduction

The current outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is posing a serious threat to public health. [1] [2] [3] Early diagnosis of suspect cases is critical to reduce and interrupt the transmission of COVID-19 from person-to-person. 4 Currently, laboratory testing of viral nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is the ""gold standard"" for COVID-19 diagnosing. 5 However, the requirement of sophisticated instruments and laboratory conditions, tedious experimental procedures, and longer detection time significantly hamper its widespread applicability. 4 Antibodies produced in the blood after COVID-19 infection are emerging as a promising class of biomarkers. 6 The antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are specific, sensitive, and more importantly, their detection can be much faster and simpler than RT-PCR, which allows rapid screening of suspect cases to be possible. 7 All the biological specimens for COVID-19 testing should be considered to be potentially infectious. Therefore, test must be performed by medical professionals with protective equipment in a qualified laboratory. To further reduce the risk of exposure to infectious agents, viral inactivation before sample handling are usually be recommended. 8, 9 While the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to the conditions of inactivation is unknown, it is reported that many coronavirus such as SARS are heat-sensitive and can be killed at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] It is thus inferred that heating at 56 ℃ could be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. 15 However, the effect of heating at 56 ℃ on COVID-19 antibody detection is unclear.

Discussion

This study analyzes the changes in SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentration before and after heat inactivation at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes. We found that after heat inactivation, all of the serum IgM (100%) demonstrated significantly lower levels. For IgG, 64.71% of the sample levels dropped after heat inactivation.All immunological assays are highly dependent on the recognition and binding of antigens to antibodies. The decrease in SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels may be related to their structural change of denaturation and aggregation. 16, 17 Previous studies have shown that antibodies can be denatured and lose their antigen binding activities after heating, 18 and IgM is reported to be less thermally stable than IgG 19,20 due to their different compositions and structures of heavy chains. 21 This is consistent with our results that SARS-CoV-2 IgM concentration decreased more significantly than IgG after heating.

These results suggests that heat inactivation of serum can lead to false-negative results in these samples.

Conclusions

Heat inactivation of serum at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. For highly suspected cases, the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was inactivated by heating.

","Introduction

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , is a pandemic that has infected more than 531,000 people around the world and caused more than 24,000 deaths as of March 26th, 2020 (1), including 85,500 cases in the United States and >3,500 in California. The exponential growth in the number of cases has overburdened clinical care facilities and threatens to overwhelm the medical workforce. These numbers underestimate the true number of infections due to the relative paucity of diagnostic testing to date (2) and the presence of asymptomatic or mild cases (3, 4) . As a result, California, along with many other states and countries, has issued a ""shelter-in-place"" policy for all residents, effective March 20, 2020. These unprecedented measures have disrupted daily life significantly for ~40 million inhabitants for an indefinite period, with the potential for profound economic losses (5) .Until late Feb 2020, the majority of infections identified in the United States were related to travelers returning from high-risk countries, repatriated citizens under quarantine, or close contacts of infected patients. Community spread, in which the source of the infection is unknown, has since been documented in multiple states. Furthermore, Washington State has reported a series of COVID-19 cases from Jan 21 to Mar 18, following the identification of an early case, WA1, on Jan 19, suggesting the presence of a persistent transmission chain in the community [Bedford, et al. 2020 ].Genomic epidemiology of emerging viruses has proven to be a useful tool for outbreak investigation and for tracking virus evolution and spread (6, 7) . During the Ebola virus disease epidemic of 2013-2016 in West Africa, genomic analyses established that the outbreak had a single zoonotic origin (8) , that two major viral lineages were circulating (9) , and that sexual transmission played a role in maintaining some transmission chains (10) . Viral genome sequencing also uncovered the route that Zika virus traveled from northern Brazil (11) to other regions, including Central America and Mexico (12) and the Caribbean and United States (13) . However, real-time genomic epidemiology data of COVID-19 to inform public health interventions in California have been lacking.We recently developed a method called metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer enrichment (MSSPE) to rapidly enrich and assemble viral genomes directly from clinical samples (14) . Here we used this method to recover viral genomes from COVID-19 patients in Northern California and perform phylogenetic analysis to better understand the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in the US and the nature of transmission of virus lineages in the community.

Results

We generated virus genomes of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in California from nasal swab samples from 29 patients, available through the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) hospital, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department, and the California Department of Public Health ( Figure 1A and Table S2 ). Presumptive positive cases were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by testing using a CDC assay approved by the FDA EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) on February 4th, 2020 (14) . Samples to be sequenced were selected for broad representation across different counties and association with known outbreaks. The 29 infected patients spanned 9 counties in Northern California ( Figure 1B ) and included (i) 9 samples airlifted from the Grand Princess cruise ship, during its excursions from San Francisco to Mexico and Hawaii in February and March 2020, (ii) 3 samples from a Solano County cluster, including the first reported case of community transmission in the United States, and (iii) 5 patients from a Santa Clara County cluster associated with workspace transmission. Fourteen of the 29 patients did not have a source of transmission that could be readily identified by travel history or epidemiological investigation.We performed MSSPE on each sample to enrich for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome (15), followed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of pooled and indexed samples on Illumina NextSeq or MiSeq instruments (16, 17) (Figure 1A ). Virus loads for the 29 patients ranged from 1.3x10 4 -2.5x10 8 copies/mL. An average of 31 million reads (interquartile ratio, IQR, 23-57 million) were generated per sample, and virus genomes were assembled by mapping to reference genome NC_045512 (Wuhan-Hu-1). The assembly yielded 28 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with genome coverage >60%, and were thus included in this study. We also retained one partial genome (UC29) with 16.2% coverage, as a full genome from this individual had been already sequenced from a high-titer earlier sample by the US CDC (MT027062). The median coverage achieved across all samples was 96.5% (IQR 84.0%-99.7%).Phylogenetic analysis shows that the SARS-CoV-2 genomes generated in this study are dispersed across the evolutionary tree of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, estimated from 342 genomes available on GISAID as of March 17th, 2020 (Figure 2A) . These viruses included 2 viruses likely related to lineages from Wuhan or other regions of China, 4 viruses related to those circulating in Europe, 11 viruses positioned in small independent clusters and not part of a larger clade, and 13 viruses associated with the Washington State (WA1) clade ( Figure 2B )..

Notably, the 9 available sequenced genomes from crew members and passengers aboard the cruise ship (UC1, UC5 to UC11, and UC19) all clustered within the WA1 lineage. The first reported case from the United States within this lineage (WA1) was reported January 19th (18) [Bedford, et al. 2020 ] and therefore substantially predates the excursions of the Grand Princess cruise ship . The SARS-CoV-2 sequences from cruise ship passengers and crew all shared two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNVs), C17747T and A17858G, as well as the triad of SNVs common to all WA1 lineages (C8782T, C18060T, and T28144C) (Figures 2 and  3 ). In addition, all of the passengers on the second cruise to Hawaii (UC 5-11) and UC1, who was on the first cruise to Mexico, carried at least 2 additional mutations not observed in UC19, who also was on the first cruise. This indicates that the virus from UC19 is most likely basal to the clade containing the cruise ship strains, and that COVID-19 infections associated with the first cruise were passed onto passengers and crew on the second cruise. The chronology and phylogeny of the cruise ship outbreak, along with the predominance of the WA1 lineage in Washington State but not outside of the US, also suggest that the virus on the Grand Princess likely came from Washington State, although it is still possible that the cases originated from a different region in which the WA1 strain is circulating. In addition to the passengers and crew members on the Grand Princess, virus genomes sampled from five cases of community transmission in different counties of the Bay area (UC19, UC20, UC22, UC23 and UC28) were also phylogenetically placed in the WA1 lineage, suggesting possible community circulation of that lineage in California as well as on the Grand Princess ship.Two out of the 29 individuals examined in this study (UC12 and UC29) had COVID-19 infections associated with international travel or exposure to travelers. UC12 was a resident of San Mateo County with a travel history to Switzerland. The genome from UC12 fell within a large lineage containing many sequences from European residents or travelers from Europe and therefore it is likely the infection was acquired there. The sequence from individual UC29 (MT027062 is from the same patient) was a returning traveler from China and has an identical COVID-19 sequence to a household contact (MT027063). Their viral genomes were more closely related to ancestral lineages from China. Interestingly, three further genomes (UC24, UC26 and UC27) also grouped within a viral lineage with widespread circulation in Europe. Individual UC27 was diagnosed after returning from a New York trip, raising the possibility of interstate transmission. Individual UC26 also reported domestic travel, while local resident UC24 had no known travel history, illustrating the existence of undetected virus transmission in the community.A small cluster of 3 cases in Solano County includes the first reported instance of community transmission in the US on February 26 (UC4) (Figures 2B and 3) . The two other cases (UC2 and UC3) were healthcare workers who were taking care of patient UC4 and likely contracted the disease in the hospital, consistent with transmission of the disease from patient to health care providers (19) . Two patients from San Mateo County (UC18 and UC25) were close household contacts (a husband and wife), and their viruses comprised a separate cluster with a virus from an infected person from China..

Out of five sequenced cases from this outbreak cluster (UC13 to UC17), three formed a distinct cluster by phylogenetic analysis (UC14 was an employee at the facility, while UC16 and UC17 were family members living in the same residence), indicating likely household transmission (Figures 2B and 3) . Notably, the genome from a Solano county resident (UC21) was also grouped into this cluster, suggesting possible circulation of a virus lineage between different counties. An active investigation regarding a putative epidemiologic link involving UC21 and individuals in the Santa Clara County cluster had been initiated prior to the genomic analyses and is ongoing at the time of publication. Two other workers (UC13 and UC15) also operated at the same building and had no direct contact with UC14; all three had different employers and no known social contact with each other. Consistent with this epidemiological data, the genomes (UC13-15) from the three workers in the large facility are distinct from each other (i.e. no identifiable shared SNV). Several possible scenarios could give rise to this observation, including the prospect that more than one virus lineage was introduced into the building via different events or the workers were infected as a result of community transmission.

Discussion

The genomic epidemiology of the COVID-19 cases associated with community spread studied here do not show a predominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage circulating in Northern California. This epidemiological profile is distinct to that in Washington State, in which the vast majority of virus genomes sequenced to date belong to a single phylogenetic lineage, WA1 [Bedford, et al. 2020 ]. The WA1 lineage strains share common ancestry with an early imported lineage that seem to have established transmission in Washington State from January 2020. By contrast, in California, we conclude that multiple recent and unrelated introductions of COVID-19 into the state via different routes have occurred, giving rise to the diversity of virus lineages reported in this study, rather than cryptic transmission of a single pre-existing lineage among counties in California. We note that this does not exclude the possibility of cryptic transmission of multiple lineages in California, as the current level of sampling is not dense enough to estimate confidently the dates of the seeding events, nor the subsequent periods of cryptic transmission before a lineage was identified.The co-clustering of the lineages from the Grand Princess cruise ship and those from several Northern California counties with community-transmitted cases in Washington State suggests an established lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA. Notably, the WA1 lineage has been recently identified in COVID-19 cases in Illinois, Minnesota, Connecticut, and Utah. The early date and basal phylogenetic position of the WA1 lineage makes it likely that the direction of dissemination was from Washington State to other states; however that conclusion could change if further genomic sampling in the US revealed substantial levels of virus genetic diversity. SARS-CoV-2 mutates more slowly than many other human RNA viruses, on the order of 1 to 2 SNV mutations a month across its ~29 kB genome (20) , as it contains a nonstructural gene with proofreading activity (21). Despite this, the WA1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 is readily identifiable with 3 key SNVs, C8782T, C18060T, and T28144C (Figure 3 ) which, at this stage in the epidemic, are distinct from other SARS-CoV-2 lineages..

First, this initial analysis represents relatively sparse sampling of cases. Undersampling of virus genomes is due in part to the high proportion of cases (80%) with asymptomatic or mild disease (3, 4, 20) and limited diagnostic testing for COVID-19 infection to date in California and throughout the United States. Second, the majority of samples analyzed were obtained from public health laboratories and thus may not be representative of the general population. Finally, phylogenetic clustering of viruses from different locations, such as Washington State and California in the same clade, does not prove directionality of spread. Despite this, our study shows that more robust insights into COVID-19 transmission are achievable if virus genomic diversity is combined and jointly interpreted with detailed epidemiological case data.Public health containment measures such as prompt isolation and contact tracing, as performed in the Solano County and Santa Clara County clusters, become more difficult to maintain once a lineage becomes established in the community. Our data suggest concerning trends in this direction, such as the association between the WA1 lineage and communityacquired COVID-19 cases in several counties of Northern California, travel-associated introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the San Francisco Bay Area from New York state, and a virus from the lineage associated with a Santa Clara County cluster detected in a resident of Solano County. Social distancing interventions, such as the ""shelter-in-place"" directive that was issued by the governor of California on March 20, 2020, may assist in stemming community spread of imported cases. If interstate dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 lineages within the US is common, then the suspension of non-essential domestic and international long-range travel may be necessary to prevent further importation of new cases in California and other states.

Ethics Statement

Clinical specimens were processed at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) under protocols approved by the UCSF Institutional Review Board (protocol no. 10-01116, 11-05519). Specimens collected by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) were deidentified and deemed not research or exempt by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (Project number 2020-30) issued under the California Health and Human Services Agency's Federal Wide Assurance #00000681 with the Office of Human Research Protections. A non-research determination for this project was also granted by Sonoma County as it was designated epidemic disease control activity, with collected data directly related to disease control.

Sample Collection

Samples obtained from the UCSF Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and placed in universal transport media (UTM, 350C, Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA). Samples obtained from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and SCDPH were nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.

At the California Department of Public Health, samples were extracted using Qiagen DSP Viral RNA mini kit with carrier RNA added (Qiagen). The one-step RT-PCR used the 2019-nCoV CDC qPCR Probe Assay targets N1 and N2, and the 2019-nCoV N Positive Control plasmid (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. IDT, Coralville, USA) as a positive control. The RNA extracts were added to an amplification reaction mix (4X TaqPath 1-step RT-PCR master mix (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), 1.5 ul primer (N1, N2, or RNase P), 12.5ul nuclease-free water, and 1ul RNA) and one-step RT-PCR was performed (25ºC for 2 mins, reverse transcription at 50ºC for 15 mins, 95ºC for 2 mins, followed by 45 cycles PCR with denaturing at 95ºC for 3s and extension at 55ºC for 30s). The cut-off for a confirmed positive sample was determined to be at a Ct value of 40 cycles, with both targets of N1 and N2 necessarily being classified as positive by quantitative RT-PCR, except for a positive RNase P as an internal quality control.

Whole Genome Sequencing of SARS-CoV2

The extracted RNA described above was converted to cDNA using MSSPE method (Metagenomic Sequencing with Spiked Primer Enrichment) as previously described (15) . The custom designed SARS-CoV-2 primers (13-nucleotide in length, IDT Technologies) were constructed using 30 early SARS-CoV-2 genome references in the National Instiutes of Health (NIH) GenBank database, and were subsequently added to the reverse transcription process (Table S1 ). The cDNA eluate was made into sequencing libraries through tagmentation (Nextera XT, Illumina), and were individually barcoded in preparation for Illumina sequencing. The samples were then bead-washed with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA) at 0.92X (23uL). The barcoded library then directly proceeds into a library recovery step. 5uL of the library is added to an amplification reaction mix (10uL Phusion 5X Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), 2.5uL of 10uM forward and reverse general primers, 1uL of 12.5mM dNTPs, 0.5uL Phusion enzyme (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), 31uL nuclease-free water) for 14 cycles, with cycling parameters as previously described (22) . The amplicons were again purified using 0.9X volume of AMPure XP beads. At this point, the purified PCR product can be analyzed by gel electrophoresis to check library size.The eluted library was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer. Sequencing libraries were then sequenced on MiSeq, Nextseq, or HiSeq 1500 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA) as 1x150 single-end or 2x150 paired-end reads.

Genome assembly and consensus generation

Raw reads were first screened via BLASTn (BLAST+ package 2.9.0) (23) for alignment to reference strain NC_045512. They were then aligned to the reference with LASTZ version 1.04.03. SARS-CoV-2 reads were trimmed using Geneious version 11.1.3 by removal of 13 nucleotides (nt) (the length of the MSSPE primer) and low-quality reads from the ends, followed by removal of duplicate reads. Trimmed reads were mapped to reference genome NC_045512 in Geneious with no gaps allowed and a maximum of 5% mismatches per read. The assembled contig was then manually annotated, and a consensus genome was generated using a majority threshold criterion..

"Abstract

Background: Conflicting recommendations exist related to whether masks have a protective effect on the spread of respiratory viruses. Results: A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24-0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11-0.37) and 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR = 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR = 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR = 0.55), SARS (OR = 0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials, case-control studies and retrospective studies.Conclusions: This study adds additional evidence of the enhanced protective value of masks,

","

Another meta-analysis suggested that facemask provides a non-significant protective effect (OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0. 16 Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of masks to prevent laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus transmission.

Identification and selection of studies

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement was consulted to report this systematic review. Regarding this meta-analysis, a comprehensive searching strategy was carefully designed to select eligible studies from multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP (Chinese) database. All included studies were published before March 2020. Relevant Chinese technical terms for the Chinese databases were used to search for published articles (see Appendix 1, for search details).Furthermore, references of all relevant articles and reviews were retrieved to search for additional eligible studies. Articles just providing abstracts were excluded. After deleting . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20051649 doi: medRxiv preprint duplicates, all abstracts and titles were filtered independently by two reviewers to remove the irrelevant articles. We downloaded and read the full text of the potential research related to the selection criteria to incorporate systematic reviews. Reviewers compared and discussed the results. If a discussion by the two reviewers did not result in an agreement, then the third party was called upon to create consensus.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The studies meeting the following criteria were included: (1) concerning the relationship between the face mask and preventing RVIs; (2) diagnosis of respiratory virus must have laboratory evidence, or the local clinical diagnostic criteria are applied during an acute large-scale infectious disease when laboratory evidence might be not available; (3) providing complete data of cases and controls for calculating an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI); (4) no language restrictions applied. The exclusive criteria were as follows: (1) insufficient data to ascertain the adjusted ORs; (2) conferences/meetings abstracts, case reports, editorials, and review articles; (3) duplicate publication or overlapping studies.

Study quality assessment

The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the case-control study and cohort study: study ratings of seven to nine stars corresponded to high-quality, five to six stars to moderate quality, and four stars or less to low quality [10]. The Jadad scale was used to evaluate the quality of randomized controlled study: study ratings of three to five corresponded to high-quality, and two or less to low quality [11] .

The disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Statistical analysis

The association of mask use with subsequent RVIs was assessed with odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Considering the potential for between-study heterogeneity, subgroup analyzes were carried out based on stratification by HCWs, countries, virus types, and study designs. Sensitivity analysis was performed by omitting individual studies to assess the stability of the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. The heterogeneity was considered insignificance when P > 0.10 and I 2 < 50%. If the study lacked heterogeneity, the pooled OR estimate was calculated using the fixed-effects model, otherwise the random-effects model was used [12] . Begg's and Egger's test were performed to quantitatively analyze the potential publication bias by Stata (version 14.0; Stata Corp, College Station, TX) software. The P values of Begg's and Egger's test more than 0.05 implied no obvious publication bias in this meta-analysis [13, 14] . The meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.3.5 (http://tech.cochrane.org/revman) [15] .

Wearing masks reduces the risk of RVIs in general

The 21 studies reporting on the effectiveness of wearing masks included 8,686participants. In general, masks are effective in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses.After wearing a mask, the risk of contracting RVIs was significantly reduced, with the pooled .

HCWs vs. non-HCWs

In the subgroup of HCWs only, the protective effect was more obvious, with the pooled OR of 0.20 (95% CI = 0.11-0.37, I 2 =59%) ( Figure 4 ). In one study investigating COVID-19, the OR was 0.04 (95%CI= 0.00-0.60) (35) . In the subgroup of non-HCW, a protective effect was found with the pooled OR of 0.53 (95% CI = 0.36 -0.79, I 2 =45%). A more detailed analysis found significant effects in both the household subgroup (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.37-0.97，I 2 =31%), and the non-household subgroup (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.33-0.59， I 2 =54%) ( Figure 5 ). 1 study included both health care workers and family members of patients, with the OR of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.29-1.90) [22] .

Subgroup analyses based on areas

By geographic locations, beneficial protective effects of wearing masks were found in Asia (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.19-0.50, I 2 =65%), and in Western countries (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.24-0.83, I 2 =51%) ( Figure 6 ). HCWs in both Asia (OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.11-0.41, I 2 =64%) and Western countries (OR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.02-0.51, I 2 =0%) can significantly reduce the risk of RVIs by wearing masks (Figure 7 ). In the non-HCW subgroup, protective effects were found in Western countries (OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.34-0.63, I 2 =57%) and Asia (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.34-0.78, I 2 =45%) ( Figure 8 ).

However, no significant protective effects against H1N1 was shown (OR =0.30, 95% CI =0.08-1. 16 , I 2 =51%) ( Figure 10 ).

Subgroup analyses based on different study designs

In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.47-0.91, I 2 =20%), case-control studies (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.18-0.33, I 2 =57%) and retrospective studies (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.26-0.55, I 2 =38%) ( Figure 11 ). Only one cohort study was included and its OR was 0.09, 95% CI = 0.00-1.60 [25] .

Discussion

This meta-analysis of all 21 available articles provides the most current evidence to date on the efficacy of masks in preventing the transmission of RVIs. The physical characteristics of the mask can prevent the respiratory tract from contacting the outside virus, thereby reducing the risk of infection with respiratory diseases. The latest research by Leung et al. found that surgical masks significantly reduced the detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, and there was a tendency to reduce coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets [36] . Our study shows that masks worn by non-infected people can effectively prevent the spread of respiratory viruses and reduce the overall risk of respiratory virus infection by 65%. This result is similar to Jefferson's .

Wearing mask has protective effects for both HCWs and non-HCWs

During current COVID-19 pandemic [1], it is pivotal to protect the HCWs from getting infected. HCWs are expected to work long hours with often inadequate resources and under significant pressure, facing the dangers inherent in close contact with index-patients during outbreak [37] . Through February 21, 2020, a total of 1,716 HCWs in China have become infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 5 have died [38] . In Italy, more than 2,600 healthcare workers have been infected by March 19, 2020, accounting for 8.3% of the country's total cases [39].According to our analysis, wearing masks significantly reduced the risk of infection among HCWs by 80%. It is noteworthy that, none of the 278 HCWs wearing N95 masks in quarantined areas were infected by SARS-CoV-2 yet, 10 of the 215 HCWs who did not wear masks in the open areas were infected [35] . Therefore, wearing proper PPE including N95 masks at all clinical settings are likely to provide great benefits for HCWs during current COVID-19 pandemic.The subgroup analysis found that it is effective not only for HCWs who are in close contact with patients but also for the non-HCWs. In non-household settings, wearing masks reduced the risk by 55%. Moreover, significant protective effects were found in the study conducted in the general population [17] , indicating the potential benefits of wearing masks for the general public. Although laboratory-confirmed virus results show no difference . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .1 1 between the mask group and the control group in a study investigating the wearing of masks by pilgrims, wearing masks reduced the risk of influenza-like illness when people gather [4] .This difference between laboratory-confirmed cases and clinically diagnosed influenza-like illness cases were likely due to an underdiagnosis of real cases caused by too few nasal swabs collected for laboratory confirmation. Zhang et al. conducted a case-control study and found that none of the passengers always wearing masks on the international flight were infected with H1N1 [32] , further suggesting that wearing masks properly may be protective when using public transport [40] . More importantly, protective benefits were also reported in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients [33] . Besides, Sokol's study also found a compliance, which showed a significant protective effect [29] . These findings implicated that proper use of masks has an impact on the effectiveness of preventing RVIs. Given that most people in household settings were unlikely to strictly follow hand hygiene and mask use recommendations [23], it is more critical to re-evaluate the strategy of self-quarantine or self-isolation at home during current COVID-19 outbreak due to higher risk of family cluster infection [45, 46] .

Wearing mask has protective effects against influenza, SARS, and COVID-19

The risk of influenza, SARS, and COVID-19 infection reduced by 45%, 74%, and 96%, CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20051649 doi: medRxiv preprint H1N1 patient encounter, which could significantly lower the sample size of data being analyzed [27] . Also, the same study indicated that majority of HCWs had received seasonal influenza vaccination, which could play a role of confounding factor contributing to protective effects toward control group. Additionally, it was noted that during acute outbreak of H1N1, specific prevention recommendations and measures lagged behind H1N1 exposures.This could suggest that HCWs may already have been infected before wearing masks, further decreasing the powers of data collected. Regarding the relationship of different medical fields and practice settings and influenza, Santo el al mentioned that physicians and registered nurses had higher risks of infection compared with outpatient and allied health staff, which could be the result of a higher risk of exposures [48] . However, Jeagers did not conclude the same findings, which could be explained by poor techniques of using PPE (such as poorly fitted N95 masks) among allied health staff [27] .

Wearing mask has protective effects in both Asian countries and Western Countries

Due to current controversial guidelines between different countries and areas, regarding the general public wearing masks. We also analyzed its effects based on different geographic locations, showing that wearing masks does provide protective effects in both Asian countries and western countries by 69% and 55%, respectively. Among HCWs, it reduced the risk in both Asian and western countries. Among non-healthcare populations, reduced risk of 54% was found in western countries, and a reduced risk of 49% was found in Asia [29] . The demonstrated reduction in risk was not insignificant and would suggest that the proper use of masks might play a significant role in public health efforts to suppress the spread of RVIs, .

Further improvements for original studies are needed in the future

Important knowledge gaps persist. At present, current evidence on the protective efficiency of masks among the general population is still insufficient. Only one study included in our meta-analysis investigated whether people with certain underlying conditions require masks or not [33] . Recall bias in case-control studies seems inevitable [22] . Therefore, high-quality and well-designed RCTs will be desired to investigate the actual protective effectiveness of masks. Although RCT, in general, is the best study design for assessing the effectiveness of interventions [11] , it should be noted that many cluster randomized trials are significantly different from ordinary RCTs (control, randomization and blind). In addition, cluster RCTs included in our study generally have insufficient trial design and low adherence and compliance to interventions Further interventional experiments should also pay attention to the delay between the onset of symptoms and the application of interventions, otherwise, the efficacy of non-drug interventions may be underestimated, or the statistical capacity to detect significant differences may be lacking. Research on enclosed spaces, such as transportation, is relatively rare [32] . Droplet-borne and airborne viruses are likely to cause large-scale infections among passengers sharing closed transportation [49] . In most studies, the detection criteria for virus types are not detailed and clear. Failure to analyze sufficient types of viruses may lead to biased results. For most studies conducted in healthcare settings, there is a lack of data on control subjects without masks. Because it would be unethical to randomly assign health care .

In this situation, MacIntyre's method could be adopted: take a convenient selection method, and choose from the hospital's HCWs in the department without the need for masks as a control [26] .

Strengths and limitations of this study

This study demonstrates the protective effects of masks on HCWs and other populations.The quality of the included studies was relatively high. There are strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and all patients have laboratory evidence or met local clinical diagnostic criteria during the outbreak. No significant publication bias was found. And detailed analysis in different settings, populations, and areas were conducted to better clarify the effectiveness of wearing masks. At present, the epidemic of COVID-19 has caused widespread concern globally. There is already evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from asymptomatic individuals, which undoubtedly puts great pressure on the protection of non-HCWs [50] .Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the evidence and select effective PPE in the view properly guiding healthcare professionals and general public regarding current COVID-19pandemic.This investigation also had several limitations. First, there was a lack of adequately designed and high-quality prospective studies. For clear research purposes, well-planned prospective studies could help us draw stronger evidence to improve understanding of the effectiveness of masks. Second, this article included some studies of SARS patients diagnosed according to clinical diagnostic criteria for SARS due to a low detection rate of RT-PCR [51] .The lack of sufficient virologic evidence may affect our conclusions. However, this effect .

Third, very few studies included in our analysis investigated the effectiveness of wearing masks by the general public, especially during an outbreak, and only one study investigated whether people with one underlying condition require masks or not [33] . Fourth, published studies have shown that different specifications of masks and different wearing methods may affect the protective effect of masks [17, 32] . And when the included studies divided the time/frequency of wearing masks, we only included the group of masks with the longest wearing/highest wearing frequency. This might also ignore effects of the short/infrequent mask-wearing. In addition, the studies we included were mainly conducted in Asia, especially China, and more evidence from other countries is needed to support our views. Last but not least, information about other confounding biases, such as vaccination, hand hygiene, age, gender, and culture, may affect the protective effect of masks.

Conclusion

Our study showed the effectiveness of wearing masks in protecting HCWs from RVIs, including SARS-CoV-2. Protective effects were also found among non-HCWs in both Western and Asian countries. However, more evidence is still needed to better clarify the effectiveness of wearing masks for different populations, such as patients with certain underlying conditions, or in different settings, such as on flights and subway. For the current global outbreak of COVID-19, we still recommend that the population should follow the current WHO recommendation or local guidelines. If masks are to be used, they should be .

"Abstract

Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the COVID-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients.This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Dia gnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value.The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682).Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients.Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.

","Introduction

The novel coronavirus disease , which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, has been called as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] [2] [3] . The disease spread rapidly from Wuhan to other areas. Compared with two other WHO blueprint priority coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is lethal 4 . As of February 25, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has led to 2663 deaths in China base on the report from National Health Commission of China.SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV likely use the same angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor [5] [6] [7] , but the clinical manifestations of two diseases were different. COVID-19 patients may develop mild or severe symptoms after infection. The mild patients show symptoms of fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, radiographic evidence of pneumonia; most of them appear to have a good prognosis. In contrast, some patients may develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure [8] [9] [10] [11] . Importantly, in most moribund patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with an inflammatory cytokine storm 4, 12 , which is mainly characterized by elevated plasma concentrations of interleukins 6 (IL-6). Indeed, several recent COVID-19 clinical studies all indicated that interleukins 6 levels is higher in severe group than those of mild group [12] [13] [14] [15] , suggesting that IL-6 might be used as a biomarker for severity evaluation. However, how the IL-6 level is quantitatively correlated with moribund patients is still unknown.Reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay (qPCR) with primers and probes targeting the N and ORF1ab genes of SARS-CoV-2 from throat swab samples have been widely used for diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Recent investigation showed that the viral load that was determined in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients 16 , implying that the viral load in respiratory specimens may not be able to objectively reflect the disease severity.Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (termed as RNAaemia by the authors in an recent study) was detected in 15% of the COVID-19 patients 9 , but the relevant characterizations is lacking. In particular, it is not clear if serum SARS-CoV-2 viral loads could be considered as a prognostic marker, especially for the severe or moribund patients, is not clear.

Data collection

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of General Hospital of Central Theater Command. Oral consent was obtained from patients. The 48 COVID-19 patients enrolled were confirmed by RT-PCR using throat-swab specimens collected at General Hospital of Central Theater Command between February 01 and February 19, 2020. Their medical records were obtained, including epidemiological, demographic, clinical manifestation, radiological characteristics, laboratory data, and outcome data were obtained. All data were checked by a team of trained physicians.

Laboratory examination

Serum samples or throat-swabs were collected from all patients and RNAs were Inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were detected with kit from Roche Ltd (Mannheim, Germany, Cat# 05109442190).

Characteristics of enrolled COVID-19 patients in this study

A total of 48 patients were enrolled in this study, which are all laboratory Table 1 

The serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was only detectable in critically ill patients

We examined the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in patients serum by real time RT-PCR, as shown in Figure 1A and B, 5 out of 48 (10.4%) were confirmed as positive (Ct-value less than 40), which was similar to the previous study 9 . Interestingly, although all the patients were throat-swab specimens test positive, none of the serum sample from mild or severe group showed positive outcome; In contrast, all of the five positive results were from critically ill patients, and two of them died after the onset of the COVID-19 (Figure 1C and D) .

As shown in Figure 2 , all the dots that stood for the ORF1ab-qPCR positive patients aggregated and located in the area represent the high probability of death occurs, indicating that RNAaemia is tightly associated with severity.Since there is no direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the blood cells, and serum virus load appear to reflect the severity, we assumed that the serum virus RNA probably was derived from the damaged organs and ruptured vessel, which was caused by aberrant and excessive immune responses. Because inflammatory cytokine storm is frequently occurred in critically ill COVID-19 patients, we then asked that if there any laboratory parameters could be associated RNAaemia and contribute to the COVID-19 severity?

Sharply increased IL-6 level was strongly associated with the COVID-19 severity

As shown in Table 2 , the absolute counts of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of the severe patients was lower, and became even lower in critically ill patients, which is consistent with recent report 17, 18 ,while the absolute counts of neutrophils were higher in critically ill patients. Procalcitonin (PCT) value was higher in critically ill patients compared with another two groups, which was similar to other clinical observation 19 , indicating an obvious elevated inflammatory response in those patients.Remarkably, sharply increased IL-6 level was observed in critically ill patients, which was almost 10-folds higher than that of severe patients, moreover, all of the death cases exhibited extremely high IL-6 value(Table S1), suggesting that IL-6 might be an important biomarker of poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. The extremely high level of IL-6 is a hallmark and an important driving force of cytokine storm 20 , which may cause multiple organs functional disability in critically ill patients 4 . Consistently, the parameters stand for the organ dysfunction, including TnT (troponin T), AST (aspartate transaminase), ALT (aspartate transaminase), CRE (serum creatinine), and BUN (blood urea nitrogen), all appear to be higher in critically ill patients compared with another two groups.

RNAaemia is closely associated with IL-6 level in critically ill COVID-19 patients

RNAaemia has been proposed in recent study as a COVID-19 related All rights reserved.

Our data strongly suggest that both RNAaemia and high IL-6 level were exclusively observed in critically ill patients, which prompt us to further study the relation between them. As shown in Figure 3A , patients with RNAaemia exhibited much higher IL-6 level compared with other patients. We then checked the IL-6 value in each of the RNAaemia patients, strikingly, all of their IL-6 value were more than 100 (Table S1 ). In order to further confirm the relation between them, we firstly analyze the IL-6 value in the critically ill patients, notably, the mortality appeared to be correlated with IL-6 value ≥100 because all of the death in this study were belong to this group (Table S1), we therefore define IL-6 value ≥100 as high and the rest of cases as low, the IL-6 high patients accounted for 35.3% in critically ill group ( Figure   3B ). As shown in Table 3 , the incidence of RNAaemia was closely correlated with IL-6 high in critically ill patients (R=0.902). These data clearly suggested that RNAaemia was related with poor prognosis, indeed, all the RNAaemia patients were at higher risk of multiple organs impairment compared to those patients without RNAaemia (Figure 4A-C) .All rights reserved.

Discussion

Although the detection of throat-swab rather than serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load is widely used for the COVID-19 diagnosis, an undeniable fact is that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) is detectable in part of the patients, however, in what scenario it become detectable and whether the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with specific type of patients is not very clear. In this study, we investigated the distribution of serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive cases in various patients groups, and the result showed that those cases all were confirmed only in critically ill patients group. Moreover, the laboratory data analysis strongly suggest that inflammatory cytokine IL-6 level was significantly elevated in critically ill patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia and the mortality. Our work may provide clues for developing new COVID-19 diagnostic strategy and therapeutic targets.Although recent studies have shown that IL-6 level increased in severe patients 14 , its level in COVID-19 critically ill patients is still unknown. IL-6 is one of the major pro-inflammatory factors that contribute to the formation of cytokine storm, which largely enhance the vascular permeability and impair the organs function. This observation might help to explain that why serum SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was only able to be detected in patients with extremely high level of IL-6. We still could not rule out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 virus amount grow explosively in a short period, which in turn induced the massive cytokine storm that characterized by elevated level of cytokines such as IL-6. We have to point out that due to the shortage of detection kit, the results of other cytokines could not be obtained and those investigations should be warranted in future study.Our research indicated that serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load and IL-6 level could serve as an indicator of poor prognosis. Since the mortality of COVID-19 critically ill patients is considerable, the host-directed therapies should be an option. If IL-6 could become a therapeutic target for treatment of critically ill patient? Notably, the IL-6 monoclonal antibody-directed COVID-19 therapy has been used in clinical trial in China (No.ChiCTR2000029765). Our data strongly support this notion and efficacy of IL-6 monoclonal antibody directed therapy remains to be fully evaluated.All rights reserved.

"Abstract

High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are nanoparticles with >80 associated proteins, phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. A comprehensive genetic analysis of the regulation of proteome of HDL isolated from a panel of 100 diverse inbred strains of mice, Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), revealed widely varied HDL protein levels across the strains. Some of this variation was explained by local, cis-acting regulation, termed cis-protein quantitative trait loci. Variations in apolipoprotein A-II and apolipoprotein C-3 affected the abundance of multiple HDL proteins indicating a coordinated regulation. We identified modules of co-varying proteins and define a protein-protein interaction network describing the protein composition of the naturally occurring subspecies of HDL in mice. Sterol efflux capacity varied up to 3-fold across the strains and HDL proteins displayed distinct correlation patterns with macrophage and ABCA1 specific cholesterol efflux capacity and cholesterol exchange, suggesting that subspecies of HDL participate in discrete functions. The baseline and stimulated sterol efflux capacity phenotypes associated with distinct QTLs with smaller effect size suggesting a multi genetic regulation. Our results highlight the complexity of HDL particles by revealing high degree of heterogeneity and intercorrelation, some of which is associated with functional variation, supporting the concept that HDL-cholesterol alone is not an accurate measure of HDL's properties such as protection against CAD.

as well as larger HDL species that contain a large core of cholesteryl esters (Kontush et al., 2013; Yetukuri et al., 2010) . In humans, discrete classes of HDL based on size can be identified. In mice, HDL sizes are more continuous (LeBoeuf and Lusis, 1983 ) and represent one monodisperse peak. The size and levels of HDL vary in both human and mouse populations (Joshi et al., 2016; Pamir et al., 2016) . There are clear functional differences associated with the various size classes of HDL. In particular, the small lipid-poor particles are the best acceptors of cholesterol from cells and thus should be particularly important in mediating reverse cholesterol transport, whereas larger particles, associated with proteins such as paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and APOE, are likely to be important in protecting against inflammation. HDL particles containing proteins such as serum amyloid A (SAA) species tend to lack anti-inflammatory properties (Vaisar et al., 2015) . HDL-C levels have a skewed normal distribution in the general population, and the median levels vary by sex and ethnicity. Linkage based studies from the early 1980's have tried to identify the genetic factors that influence plasma HDL-C levels, but many findings have not been replicated due to polygenic nature of this trait, with contributions from multiple small-effect gene variants. Meta-analyses and GWAS results do, however, support the association of HDL-C with variation in CETP, LIPC, LPL, ABCA1, endothelial lipase (LIPG) and LCAT (Hegele, 2009; Thompson et al., 2008) . Multiple genetic factors could be present in an individual, creating a polygenic network of HDL-C determinants (Cohen et al., 2004) . These determinants include monogenic effectors, such rare homozygous mutations in ABCA1, LCAT, and APOA1 causing extremely low HDL-C (Brooks-Wilson et al., 1999; Kuivenhoven et al., 1996; Ng et al., 1994) , and rare homozygous mutations in CETP, LIPC, and SCARB1, causing extremely elevated HDL-C . The mouse models of these variants have been supportive of the human findings (Wang and Paigen, 2005) (Wang & Paigen, 2005) . Polygenic determinants have been recently investigated using targeted next-generation sequencing in patients with extremely low and high HDL-C. About 30% of individuals at the extremes of HDL-C had rare large effect and common small effect variants explaining the trait (Dron et al., 2017) . Whereas the genetic determinants of plasma HDL-C levels have been well studied, the genetic determinants of HDL proteome and lipidome have never been previously investigated.To better define the various species of HDL at the level of protein composition and to understand their genetic regulation we used the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) with a systems biology approach (Bennett et al., 2010; Ghazalpour et al., 2012) . HMDP is a collection of 100 classical laboratory and recombinant inbred (RI) strains that have been genotyped at 135,000 SNPs (Bennett et al., 2010) . HMDP provides a confined genetic space (Bennett et al., 2010) that rely on naturally occurring genetic variation that perturbs protein abundance. We performed systems genetics approach using analytical approaches that include genome-wide association, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) discovery, functional outcomes and network analysis (Bennett et al., 2010) .We identified HDL proteome and HDL function for each strain. Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses, we performed genetic mapping. First, associations between SNPs and HDL protein levels and function were determined. Second, the effects of SNPs on gene regulation were determined by eQTL analysis using hepatic and adipose tissue-specific gene expression. Based on the genetic variation in HDL observed, we were able to identify numerous genetic factors mediating HDL composition and provide an approximation of the nature of the interactions between the proteins. Finally, we used protein-protein interaction cluster analyses to build an HDL model that describes the group of proteins that constitute the core proteins and the ones that are peripheral. We identified moderate QTLs associated with HDLs sterol efflux capacity. Our results reveal a great deal of heterogeneity and inter-correlation, some of which is of proteins that are acutely regulated by the environment (ie. Diet and inflammationhttp://homepages.uc.edu/~davidswm/HDLproteome.html). The H2 scores for such proteins are expected to be zero. Furthermore, due to our study design, the proteins that are strain specific are also expected to have a H2 of zero.

Genetic regulation of HDL proteome

Loci contributing to variations in protein levels (protein QTLs or pQTLs) or hepatic transcript levels of the proteins (expression QTLs or eQTLs) were mapped using the FAST LMN, an association algorithm with a mixed model component to correct for population structure. Association analysis was performed using about 200,000 informative SNPs (Bennett et al., 2010) , spaced throughout the genome (Table 2 ). Hepatic transcript levels were from a previous survey of the HMDP maintained on the same chow diet as in this study (Bennett et al., 2010) . Loci averaged 500 kb to 2 Mb in size and in most cases contained 1 to 20 genes within a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block, an improvement of more than an order of magnitude as compared to traditional linkage analysis in mice (typically a resolution of 10 to 20 Mb) (Flint et al., 2005) . Loci mapping within 1Mb of the gene are termed ""local"" QTL, suggesting that they probably act in cis. For example, promoter or enhancer variants would act in cis. Loci mapping greater than 1Mb from the gene of interest are termed ""distal"", implying that they act in trans, presumably mediated by a diffusible factor such as a transcription factor (Table 2 and  Supplemental Table 2 ). We applied a significance filter of P=10 -3 and 10 -6 to identify suggestive cis and trans QTLs respectively.A total of 19 HDL proteins showed significant evidence of local regulation of hepatic transcript levels or protein levels (Table 2) . With the exception of Apoc3, all of the significant pQTL also exhibited significant eQTL, indicating that genetic variation in protein levels was largely due to regulation of gene expression. In the case of Apoc3, while there was no significant eQTL in liver, there was a highly significant eQTL in adipose tissue (P=1.8 x 10 -7 ) (Supplemental Table  3 ). Apoa2 and Saa2 exhibited much more significant pQTL than eQTL (P=1.324e-22, effect size = -0.413 vs. P=1.276e-4, effect size = 0.0210 for Apoa2, and P=2.559e-10, effect size = 0.0780 and P=1.533e-6, effect size = 0.780 for Saa2 respectively), suggesting that the pQTL were due to coding rather than regulatory variations. In the case of Apoa2, our previous studies indicated that structural variation affecting translation efficiency was largely responsible for the differences in protein levels among several common inbred strains (Bennett et al., 2010) . Also, common coding variants are present among the HMDP strains for both Apoe3 and Saa2 (www.informatics.jax.org). As shown in Table 2 , many variants significantly affecting HDL protein expression did not exhibit corresponding variations in protein levels. A likely explanation in the case of HDL is that, for some proteins, only a limited amount of the protein can be incorporated into the HDL lipid-protein complex, the remainder presumably being degraded.We have attempted to identify distal (trans-acting) factors affecting HDL protein levels (Supplemental Table 2 ). In contrast to local eQTL, where only SNPs within 1Mb of the gene are tested for association, distal QTL analyses involve genome wide SNP tests for association, requiring a much higher threshold for significance. A number of the likely significant distal eQTL occur with several Mb of the gene and, thus, probably result from either long range (>1 Mb) linkage disequilibrium or chromosome looping interactions (for example Apoh, Apom, B2m, H2-Q10, and Pp1c) (Supplemental Table 2 ). The pQTL analysis also identified some highly significant distal (trans-acting) interactions, most notably for Apoa2 (p=4.6 x 10 -14 ). The Apoa2 locus is about 5 Mb from the structural gene and the significant association is probably the result of linkage disequilibrium or chromosome looping.We asked if the local pQTL could be used to identify causal interactions between HDL proteins. For this, we selected the genes with significant pQTL and asked whether the peak local pQTL SNP was associated with any other HDL proteins, suggesting that the regulation of the former perturbs levels of the latter. For example, Apoe3 (on chr. 9) protein levels were controlled by a local pQTL with peak SNP 46673334 (chr. 9) and the same SNP was significantly associated with the levels of Podx1 (chr. 6, p=4x10 -3 ), Fetub (chr. 16, p=5.5x10 -3 ), Apoc2 (chr. 7, p=5.9x10 -3 ), and a number of other proteins. Likewise, a local pQTL SNP for Apoa2 was associated with Apoc3 and Itgb3 levels and an Hq-Q10 local pQTL SNP was associated with Apob and Apoe levels (Supplemental Table 4 ).

Clustering of HDL metrics based on quantitation across strains

To understand interactions of HDL proteins with each other and with other metrics of HDL (ABCA1 specific sterol efflux, baseline -diffusion sterol efflux, HDL particle size, and HDL cholesterol), we correlated proteins that are present in more than 80% of the strains. We then applied hierarchical clustering to a matrix that contains all measured phenotypes. The clustering of the proteome and functional metrics revealed expected patterns (Figure 3 for yeast normalized and Supplemental Figure 3 for total normalized data). The complex correlation matrices represented a high number of strongly correlated variables suggesting an organized interplay among HDL proteins and between the physiological and functional metrics of HDL ( Figure. 4 and Supplemental Figure 4 for yeast and total normalized data respectively). Of the 8100 total correlations, we have focused on 2216 correlations that are |r|>0.5 with a Bonferroni-Holm adjusted P<0.05, n=2216. The correlation and P values are presented in Supplemental Table 2 .All sterol efflux metrics displayed up to 4-fold differences across strains (Supplementary Figure  7) . The non-proteome phenotypes clustered together; for example, unstimulated sterol efflux from two different cell types, min.cAMP and min.MF and stimulated sterol efflux (r= 0.909, P=10 -15 ), plus. cAMP and plus.MF (r=0.83, P=10 -15 ) correlated strongly and were part of the same cluster that is modestly associated with APOA1 (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 2 ). The ABCA1 mediated sterol efflux, delta BHK and delta J774, correlated strongly (r=0.73, P=10 -15 ) and formed a cluster along with HDL-C and medium size HDL where the latter two metrics correlated strongly (r=0.78, P=1.82e-12) (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 5) .HDL-C was negatively associated with ABCA1 mediated sterol efflux from both BHK and J774 cells (r=-0.58, P=0.00036 and -0.49, P=0.03 respectively) and was positively associated with the diffusional (unstimulated) efflux from both cell types (r=0.62 P=6.14e-06 for BHK and r=0.64 P=2.04e-05 for J774).Mice have 85% of their HDL cholesterol distributed in the 7.6-9.8nm range (medium size) in a monodispersed peak (Pamir et al, 2016) , and therefore medium size HDL represents the majority of HDL cholesterol. This latter cluster is associated with APOA2 levels ( Figure 3 ). Further, proteins that participate in immune responses, including serum amyloids SAA1, SAA2, histocompatibility complexes H2-Q4 and H2-Q10 associated strongly and formed a distinct cluster with other immune response proteins CD97, C4BPA and APOE. All of the hemoglobin proteins, HBBA, HBB1, HBBT1 formed a distinct cluster. Lipid metabolism proteins, APOC1, APOA5, APOA4, PLTP, and GPLD1 clustered together. Most interestingly, APOC3 correlated negatively with 39 proteins on HDL. Among these were proteins with roles in immune response such as APOE, PON1, SAA1, SAA4 (Supplementary Table 5 ). insulin like growth factor binding protein, IGFALS clustered strongly but negatively with APOC3 (r=-0.53, P=0.002). Recent studies suggest a role for APOC3 in beta cell insulin resistance (Åvall et al, 2015) and according to proteome interactome by Harmonizome (a tool curated from 100 public databases (Rouillard et al, 2016) ) APOC3 is one of the 73 proteins found to interact with IGFALS. We observed significant correlations between HDL-C levels and GM94, ITGB1, APOC1, APOC2 (positive) and APOA2, SERPINA1A, ALB, and TFRC (negative) regardless of PSM normalization method used (Supplemental Table 5 ). All the New Zealand strains studied (NZB BIN/J, NZW LAC/J, KKHI/J) were in the top quintile of HDL-C distribution and bottom quintile of APOA2 distribution. The QTL analysis indicated the same genomic regions for regulation of APOA2 and HDL-C levels (Supplemental Figure 8) . APOA2 seems to be the main genetic regulator of plasma HDL-C levels in mice.Among the HDL proteins, APOD, with high homology to carrier proteins such as lipocalins and with strong innate immune response roles such as antioxidative (Ganfornina et al., 2008) and neuroprotective effects (Do Carmo et al., 2008) had the most, significant correlations with other HDL proteins involved in immune response. Twenty of these correlations exhibited |r|>0.7 suggesting that it is highly interactive apolipoprotein that acts as a carrier for other proteins on HDL.Another way to visualize the relationships among the proteins is to present these as a correlation network ( Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure 5 ). The network consists of multiple layers of spatial organization, a core, an outer layer and the periphery. The ""core"" proteins, including AHSG, NAPSA, PLG, SAA4, HBA, APOD, APOJ, APOM, APOH, FGA, and TFPI are surrounded by common HDL associated apolipoproteins such as APOA4, APOA5, APOC1, APOC3, APOC4 in addition proteins that have been described to be associated with HDL in most proteomic studies ( Davidson HDL proteome watch http://homepages.uc.edu/~davidswm/HDLproteome.html) such as H2-Q4, H2-Q10, SELL, ANTRX1/2, PF4 RBP4, SERPINs, GPLD1, FGA and FGB. More peripheral are known associated proteins such as PLTP, PON3, LCAT, APOE, SAA1, SAA2. HDL core proteins formed a tight network suggesting that they are co-regulated. Inflammation response and complement activation proteins such as SAA1, SAA2, H2-Q4, H2-Q10, C3, C4b, C4BPA were distal to the core co-regulatory network suggesting that they are mostly regulated by external factors such as an inflammatory stimulus. The two major structural proteins, APOA1 and APOA2 along with APOC3 were on the outer layers and periphery and are negatively correlated with other proteins suggesting that their presence requires the displacement of other proteins.

Genetic Regulation of Sterol Efflux

The sterol efflux capacity was measured in two different cell lines (J774 and BHK) in basal (no ABCA1) and stimulated (with ABCA1) conditions, with ABCA1 specific sterol efflux calculated by subtracting basal from stimulated. The QTL analysis for the efflux traits revealed shared global association profiles that are condition specific and in agreement between cell types (Supplemental Figure 6 A and B) . The significant QTLs that are shared by both cell types are presented in Table 4 . The lack of strong QTLs that associate with sterol efflux capacity of HDL suggest that either sterol efflux is under limited genetic control or its control is multigenic with small effect sizes.

Lipid and clinical trait interactions

The HMDP strains have been examined in separate studies (Lusis et al., 2016) either on chow (Bennett et al., 2010) , high fat/high sucrose (Parks et al., 2013; or high cholesterol diets (Bennett et al., 2015) 2. We compared our data with results from these studies, reasoning that while power to detect correlation will be diminished given that the data were collected in separate animals and at different times with incomplete overlap of strains, traits significantly impacted by genetics should still retain some correlation structure. The most significant correlations between HDL proteins and clinical traits are summarized in Table 3 and detailed in Supplemental Table 6. A total of 22 HDL proteins significantly and positively correlated with lesion area in the hypercholesterolemia study (Bennett et al., 2015) among which Plasminogen (PLG), Immunoglobin chain C region (IGHM), Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) were strongest (r=0.469, P=0.00026; r=0.461, P=0.00034, r=0.37, P=0.0049). We have recently shown that plasminogen is an effective sterol acceptor through ABCA1 and this could be the mechanism by which plasminogen contributes to atherosclerosis (Pamir et al., 2017) .Conforming to the recently identified role of APOC3 in insulin resistance, HOMA-IR plasma insulin levels, body weight and adiposity correlated positively with HDL associated APOC3 levels (r=0.50, P=0.00017; r=0.44 P=0.0015; r=0.23, P=0.048; r=0.26, P=0.021, respectively).

Discussion

We report the analysis of the HDL proteome across a set of 93 inbred strains of mice exhibiting common genetic variation. The genetic variation across this mouse panel resembles that in human populations, based on the number of common SNPs (about 4 million). Previous studies in mice have revealed genetic variations in the levels of HDL-cholesterol, HDL apoproteins, and HDL composition (Lusis et al., 1983) . Our results are consistent with a high level of heritability of HDL proteins, including the identification of a number of novel pQTLs. One significant conclusion that has emerged is that certain proteins cluster together in response to genetic perturbations, presumably reflecting physical or regulatory interactions. These clusters then help define the heterogeneity of HDL particles, although our analyses do not address lipid heterogeneity. Another important conclusion is evidence of a relationship between protein composition and HDL function. Finally, we have identified potential links between HDL proteins and various clinical or molecular traits studied previously in the HMDP strains. We discuss each of these points in turn below.Normalization of shotgun proteomic data is a continuous struggle in the field (Välikangas et al., 2018) . HDL is a rather uncomplicated mixture containing only ~100 proteins. However, its proteome is driven by the 10 most abundant proteins, with 65% being made up of APOA1 and 15% of APOA2 (Toth et al., 2013) . The normalization strategy should conserve the compositional bias of the HDL. The normalization that directly adjusts scale such as Total Count (TC) and Upper Quartile (UQ) fails to accommodate compositional bias. The normalization strategies that adjust scales using landmarks in the distribution Median, (Med), Differentially expressed (DESeq), Trimmed mean (TMM) are promising approaches for HDL proteome however, detailed analyses need to be performed for their validation to be used on smaller libraries of stochastic count data from mass spectrometry. The quartile (Q) and reads per kilobase per million mapped (RPKM) (equivalent of normalizing spectral counts to protein length) have adverse effects on intra-sample variance and on distribution bias (Dillies et al., 2013) . The TC and UQ normalizations favor the most abundant proteins and are unfriendly for mixtures with a distribution bias. That said, TC normalization is often the preferred method for shotgun HDL proteomics as it controls for differences in instrument response, digestion efficiency, and amounts of loaded protein digest but fails at conserving the distribution bias as it tends to accommodate the changes in the abundant proteins (Vaisar et al., 2007) . That is partly why the HDL protein quantification by shotgun proteomics is not optimal and the correlation with immunobased assays are moderate (Hoofnagle et al., 2012) . Therefore, we opted to include a second normalization approach by spiking yeast carboxy peptidase at levels ~8 fold lower than APOA1 and to correspond to the median/mean abundance of the typical HDL proteome (Carvalho et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2004) . The QTLs identified using both proteomic information are mostly overlapping with TC normalization resulting in ~30% more significant QTLs. The relationships among inbred lines of mice was inferred from the high-density SNP map where strains cluster according to their genealogy (Cervino et al., 2005) . We employed the same approach: The 155 proteins that were present in at least 20% of the strains loosely predicted the relatedness of the strains according to their genealogy for inbred strains and according to the breeding scheme for recombinant strains . Almost half of these proteins (81) were present in greater than 80% of the strains and only 34 were shared by all the strains. The strain dependent distribution of HDL proteome across 93 strains validates our previous studies with only 5 strains (Pamir et al., 2016) . However, the comparison of the clustering patterns between microarray data or the SNPs did not reach full agreement as genetic variation explains only a fraction of the variation and a very small part of the genome is involved in regulating HDL (data not shown). The 93 strains are represented by N=1-5 with a distribution of ~4, 9, 75, 9, and 1 % for N=1,2,3,4, and 5 respectively. Even though, these N are not optimal to calculateintra and -inter strain variation, the broad sense heritability calculations captured 65 proteins that have greater than 10% heritability. Among which APOA2 has a score of 0.62 which is consistent with its strong association with HDL-C loci -a highly heritable trait.The high-level heritability of the proteins is demonstrated by >20K pQTL associated SNPs that map to > 66 loci. To understand whether a pQTL results from structural or regulatory variation, we have incorporated gene expression information. A positive finding in such analysis suggests that the genotype dependent differential gene expression is the basis of most of the association. (Farber et al., 2011) . In our studies, we used adipose and liver tissue global gene expression profiles to map distinct loci in liver (5) and adipose tissue (20) and that are associated with the gene expression levels for the SNPs associated with pQTLs. Adipose tissue exhibited only inflammatory gene (Saa1, Saa2, Tfrc, Vtn) associated SNPs that were almost exclusively transacting. Liver tissue had cis and trans eQTLs associated with multiple genes including Apoc4, Apoh, Fgb, Tfrc, Saa2. The complex regulation at the protein and gene expression level dictates the protein composition of HDL and its hereditary preservation.Correlation networks such as weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes. The weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), revealed that core HDL proteins, composed of most common apoproteins are highly correlated and co-regulated. The co-regulated gene network is consistent with HDL's role in innate immunity and lipid metabolism as it reveals a tight network of co-regulation among the proteins with primary roles in immunity and lipid metabolism. The histocompatibility protein isoforms such as H2Q4 and H2-Q10 that have been shown to be associated with mouse HDL in multiple studies (S. M. Gordon et al., 2010; Pamir et al., 2016) are part of the core co-regulated proteins. In mice, histocompatibility proteins play a role in innate immunity by antigen presenting via major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC-1).H2-Q10 is the only murine MHC-1 protein found in the serum in appreciable concentrations (Lew et al., 1986) . While these innate immune proteins with roles in antigen presentation are part of core co-regulation network, acute phase proteins such SAA1 and SAA2 are not, as they are primarily regulated by an inflammatory stimulus.While up to 50% of HDL cholesterol level can be heritable, less is known about heritability of its sterol efflux function or its proteome (Bentley et al., 2014; Goode et al., 2007) . The sterol efflux capacity of HDL seems to be regulated by a multigenic architecture with small effect size. The loci captured using 93 strains of mice have moderate P values and small effect sizes. In a human cohort of 846 individuals, Villard et al tested 7 preselected SNPs with known effects in HDL metabolism such as ABCA1, CETP, APOA1 and APOA2. Seven SNPs tested accounted together for approximately 6% of total plasma efflux capacity supporting our findings of moderate strength QTLs.The classic linear view of HDL genesis from discoidal, lipid-poor nascent particles to spherical, cholesterol-and phospholipid-rich particles packed with a combination of over 100 different proteins has been recently challenged by the finding that HDL is secreted directly from hepatocytes in 4 distinct sizes, with little interchange between them, and representing all of the plasma HDL subparticle pools (Mendivil et al., 2016) . Although our analyses do not incorporate the lipidome of HDL which can contribute to the orchestration of the composition of HDL sub populations, and our samples weren't stored with a cryoprotectant (HDL structure, function and proteome can be affected and proteome under represented (Holzer et al, 2017) a highly inter correlated proteome reveals the complexity of HDL particle composition. We captured a remarkable 2216 correlations among the proteins that survived multiple comparison correction and that explains at least 25% of the variation (R2>0.25). The hierarchical clustering of the correlated proteins regrouped the proteins according to their biological functions emphasizing the coordinated co-regulation. However, while applying the stringent statistical approach certain biological relationships were missed. For example, APOC3 significantly and exclusively negatively correlated with 36 other HDL proteins (Supplementary Table 2 ). In humans, }increased circulating APOC3 levels are associated with cardiovascular disorders, inflammation, and insulin resistance (Chan et al., 2008; Petersen et al., 2010) . On the other hand, humans with an APOC3 mutation benefit from a favorable lipoprotein profile, increased insulin sensitivity, lower incidence of hypertension, and protection against cardiovascular diseases (Atzmon et al., 2006; Jørgensen et al., 2014; Pollin et al., 2008) . The negative correlation of APOC3 with 36 other proteins, its association with plasma insulin levels, and HOMA-IR levels conforms to its newly appreciated role as a brake on the metabolic system. Efforts to identify the proteomic, lipidomic, and functional fingerprints of HDL subspecies are of critical importance and may open paths to novel pharmacological targets. Clinical and epidemiological studies show a robust, inverse association between HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and CHD risk (D. J. Gordon and Rifkind, 1989; Wilson et al., 1988) . However, pharmacological interventions aimed at raising HDL cholesterol levels in humans showed no cardiovascular benefits (AIM-HIGH Investigators et al., 2011; Barter et al., 2007; Landray et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2012) . Since the collapse of the HDL-C hypothesis for atherosclerosis, a new generation of HDL metrics are under investigation to be used in clinic (Fazio and Pamir, 2016) . For example, greater HDL cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), independent of levels of HDL-C and APOA1 (the major structural protein of HDL), is associated with a lower prevalence of atherosclerotic vascular disease (Khera et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Rohatgi et al., 2014) . Most changes in HDL function are likely to be a reflection of changes in the HDL proteome (Green et al., 2008; Vaisar et al., 2007) . Thus, identification of the protein signature responsible for loss of sterol efflux capacity could provide biomarkers of clinical validity to assess CHD risk. The interplay between HDL sterol efflux function, particle concentration, size and HDL proteome is still poorly understood. HDL-C levels correlated strongly with all the efflux measures. While we captured strong associations between expected metrics such as diffusional or ABCA1 specific efflux from two different cell types, no single HDL protein explained the majority of the variation in sterol efflux, suggesting that it is a polygenic process. That said, APOA2 explained about 10% of ABCA1 dependent sterol efflux from both cell types and the Apoa2 locus was strongly associated with ABCA1 specific sterol efflux (data not shown). In mice, APOA2 seems to impact the sterol efflux function at the protein and gene level. It is important to note that Apoa2 locus aligns with HDL-C QTL.In summary, a systems biology approach reveals the highly complex and inter-correlated nature of HDL protein composition, heritable contributions to both HDL levels and composition and its association with disease. We show that HDL proteins preserve hereditary patterns that are likely to harbor ancestral/lineage information. It is likely that inheritance controls the production of HDL particles of a certain protein and lipid composition that have different functions. At present, we lack a model for the assembly of HDL protein and lipid cargo. Our results provide the ground work to support future studies aimed at characterization of the genetic architecture regulating HDL function and comprehensive composition in humans.

Methods

Mice. All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Los Angeles. Mice were housed (1-3/cage) in a pathogen-free barrier facility (22°C) with a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. All the strains were a fed low-fat diet (Wayne Rodent BLOX 8604; Harlan Teklad Laboratory). 60-80 day old mice fasted for 16 h at 7pm and sacrificed at 9am the following morning. Mice were bled from the retro-orbital sinus into tubes containing EDTA (final concentration 1 mM), after isofluorane inhalation. Plasma was collected and stored at −80 o C until analysis. Plasma HDL-C measurements. Plasma cholesterol levels (Invitrogen) were determined biochemically following the manufacturer's guidelines. (Shao et al., 2005) . Efflux of [ 3 H]cholesterol was measured after a 4 h incubation in medium with APOB depleted serum HDL (2.8% v/v). ABCA1-specific cholesterol efflux capacity was calculated as the percentage of total [ 3 H]cholesterol (medium plus cell) released into the medium of BHK cells stimulated with mifepristone after the value obtained with cells stimulated with medium alone was subtracted. HDL isolation. Serum HDL was prepared by adding calcium (2 mM final concentration) to plasma and using PEG (polyethylene glycol, 8kDa, Sigma) to precipitate lipoproteins containing APOB (VLDL, IDL, LDL). After centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4 o C, serum HDL was harvested from the supernatant. HDL was isolated from serum or EDTA-anticoagulated plasma, using sequential ultracentrifugation (d=1.063-1.21 mg/mL) (Vaisar et al., 2007) . HDL was stored on ice in the dark and used within 1 week of preparation. For each isolation batch, control samples from the same pooled mouse plasma were included and further processed by tryptic digest and MS to control for experimental variability. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis. HDL (10 μg protein) isolated by ultracentrifugation and 0.5 ug of yeast carboxypeptidase were solubilized with 0.1% RapiGest (Waters) in 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin (1:20, w/w HDL protein; Promega) for 3 h at 37°C. After a second aliquot of trypsin (1:20, w/w HDL protein) was added, samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. After RapiGest was removed by acid hydrolysis, samples were dried and stored at −20°C until analysis. Prior to analysis, samples were reconstituted in 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (Pamir et al., 2016) . Tryptic digests of mouse HDL (1 μg protein) were injected onto a C18 trap column (Paradigm Platinum Peptide Nanotrap, 0.15 x 50 mm; Michrom Bioresources Inc.), desalted (50 μL/min) for 5 min with 1% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid, eluted onto an analytical reverse-phase column (0.15 x 150 mm, Magic C18AQ, 5 μm, 200 A; Michrom Bioresources Inc.), and separated on a Paradigm M4B HPLC (Michrom Bioresources Inc.) at a flow rate of 1 μL/min over 180 min, using a linear gradient of 5% to 35% buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) in buffer A (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic aci"

","Summary Background

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, while several key epidemiological parameters of the disease remain to be clarified. This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between infector's exposure and infectee's exposure), serial interval, time point of exposure (the day of infectee's exposure to infector relative to the latter's symptom onset date) and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19.

Methods

Between late February and early March of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside China and from 1790 publications identified in PubMed and CNKI.To be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter. As relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of estimates. Additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (< 0.3 day).Depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented.

Findings

In total, 1155 cases from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Malaysia were included for the final analysis. The mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period, 6 .70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before infector's symptom onset) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure. R0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas. For 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days. In 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before infectors' symptom onsets. In 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, infectees' symptom onsets occurred before those of infectors. Stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed.

Interpretation

This study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19.The findings support current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the Introduction In December 2019, a novel enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus, which was later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province of China. 1 The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, i.e., coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread across and outside China rapidly, and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020.Despite the explosive growth of the number of studies on COVID-19, several key epidemiological parameters of the disease remain to be clarified, among which are incubation period and serial interval. The two parameters have important implications for the monitoring, surveillance and control of infectious disease. The mean or median incubation period and serial interval estimated by previous studies were mostly 4 to 5 days, 2-7 and 4 to 4.5 days, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] respectively. While some of the studies included only a limited number of cases (around or less than 100), 2, 4, 6, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] others might have suffered from inaccuracy of original data. For example, in some studies, most cases had a long or even unclear interval of exposure, making it difficult to determine the exact exposure date 3, 5, 13 and giving rise to error. Besides, the order of transmission (i.e., who is infector and who is infectee) in clustering cases, which is crucial to estimation of both parameters, is easy to be mistaken given the possibility of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, [14] [15] [16] [17] but previous studies rarely described how this issue was handled.Incubation period and serial interval are also key parameters for epidemiological modelling in predicting the transmission dynamics, including the basic reproduction number (R0). R0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by a single infectious individual in a totally susceptible population. 18 Estimation of R0 may require the knowledge of latent period and infectious period, 19, 20 which are both difficult to measure directly. For a disease that is not infectious until onset of symptoms, latent period is equivalent to incubation period, and infectious period can commonly be approximated by the difference of serial interval minus incubation period. 18 However, for COVID-19, the latent period appears to be shorter than incubation period as pre-symptomatic transmission might occur, 16, 17 and this should be accounted for when estimating R0. To our best knowledge, no published studies estimated the latent period of COVID-19, or how often and approximately at which time point the disease could be transmitted prior to the symptomatic onset.This study made use of the large amount of data reported by the health authorities of and outside China and those from published studies to address the above issues. Specifically, it was aimed to obtain robust estimates of the following epidemiological parameters of COVID-19: 1) incubation period, 2) the upper limit of latent period, as the exact latent period cannot be observed, 3) serial interval, 4) time point of exposure, referring to the day of infectee's exposure to infector relative to the latter's symptom onset date, and 5) R0.

Data sources

For China, all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities (including mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) that had reported cases of COVID-19 were identified according to the daily updates by the National Health Commission of China. 21 We also searched for individual cases from relevant departments and public media of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, but failed to find any with details allowing for parameters estimation in this study. Typically, the dates of exposure and symptom onset were lacking, e.g., see reference. 23 Owing to language barrier, we did not do a comprehensive search for other countries. A full list of the abovementioned data sources, including their URLs, can be found in Appendix 1.PubMed was searched to identify relevant publications by using the following terms: 

Definitions and inclusion criteria

To be eligible, a report had to contain individual data that allowed for estimation of at least one of the following parameters of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19: incubation period, All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040329 doi: medRxiv preprint serial interval, time point of exposure, and the upper limit of latent period.Incubation period was defined as the time interval between exposure and onset of disease symptoms. To obtain an accurate estimate, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the analysis. For those exposed for three continuous days and those exposed on two dates with one day apart (i.e., exposed on the first and third days), the second day was uniformly used as the exposure date in estimation. For those exposed for two continuous days, the first day was uniformly used as the exposure date in estimation. This approach ensured the upper limit of error in the estimated incubation period be smaller than 1 day for the cases with a 2-day or 3-day exposure, regardless of when exactly (i.e., first, second, or third day) the transmission actually occurred. In reality, the overall error was bound to be much smaller than 1 day, as most included cases were exposed for only 1 day which would dilute the overall error.Serial interval was defined as the duration between symptom onset of an infector (e.g., a primary case) and that of an infectee (e.g., a secondary case) in a transmission chain, which was typically seen in cluster infections. A negative value meant that the infectee's symptoms occurred before the infector's symptoms. For two cases to qualify as an infector-infectee pair and be included in this study, the following two criteria must both be fulfilled. First, there was evidence that the presumed infector had been exposed outside the cluster (e.g., close contact with a confirmed case, travel history to Hubei, exposure to a person who returned from Hubei) before he/she joined the group activities such as family gathering and business conference that gave rise to cluster infections. Second, the presumed infectee was exposed to the presumed infector only in the 14 days prior to symptom onset, without other exposure histories.Time point of exposure in this study referred to the day of infectee's exposure to infector relative to the latter's symptom onset date, and was estimated by the infectee's exposure date minus the infector's symptom onset date, where a negative value meant that the exposure occurred before the infector developed symptoms. The upper limit of latent period was defined as the interval between the exposure of infector and that of infectee in a transmission chain, which was used to estimate the longest possible latent period of an individual infector (the exact latent period cannot be observed in reality). If there were more than one infectee caused by an infector, only the one with the earliest exposure date was used in estimating this parameter.Estimation of the time point of exposure and upper limit of latent period also involved determination of exposure date and judgement about transmission chain, hence the related principles applied in estimating incubation period and serial interval were also followed here.

Screening, data extraction, and quality control

Six researchers were involved in data collection. The reports retrieved through the above searches were scrutinized one by one according to the inclusion criteria specified above. The following data were extracted from eligible reports by using a standard extraction form which was pilot-tested with the reports from Liaoning province of China: the geographical location All rights reserved.

For a clustering case, the generation he/she belonged to and the exposure date, symptom onset date and severity of the infector were also recorded. The retrieved reports were split into six parts, with each researcher responsible for one part. For each part, the eligibility of and data extracted from reports were firstly determined by one researcher and then cross-checked by another three researchers. All uncertainty and disagreements were discussed among the researchers. If no consensus could be reached after discussion, the concerned cases would be excluded to ensure the correctness and accuracy of data. For example, if it could not be determined who was infected through attending a group activity (i.e., infectee) and who had been infected before he/she attended the activity (i.e., infector), then all clustering cases related to the activity had to be excluded.

Data analysis

The basic characteristics of included cases were summarized descriptively. The lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets of incubation period and upper limit of latent period, and the key parameters were estimated by using the maximum likelihood approach. For serial interval and time point of exposure, we assumed that they followed a normal distribution. 8 This was to address the negative values in the serial interval reported by previous studies, in which case the lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions may be limited. 24, 25 For each parameter, the range, median, selected percentiles, mean and standard deviation were estimated. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of mean and standard deviation were estimated by using the bootstrap technique. R0 was estimated by using two widely accepted formula: 8, 9, 19, 20 where r is exponential growth rate, μ is mean serial interval, σ is standard deviation of serial interval, 1/a is latent period, and 1/b is infectious period. The exponential growth rate was obtained directly from a previous study reporting incidence data of the early stage of epidemic, 1 while the other parameters came from the present study. The latent period was approximated by the upper limit of latent period, and the infectious period was approximated as serial interval minus the upper limit of latent period. Although the true value of latent period was bound to be smaller than the upper limit, we argued that this would not exert a significant impact on the estimation of R0 according to the above formula (2), because when the latent period became shorter the infectious period would become longer accordingly, given a fixed serial interval.Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of the three parameters involving exposure date. Specifically, the third day for those whose exposure period spanned All rights reserved.

The difference between the estimates from sensitivity analysis and those from primary analysis represents the largest possible error in the latter. For serial interval and time point of exposure, which had negative values, the datasets were also fitted with shifted lognormal, Weibull and gamma distributions to see if the mean and standard deviation would change much. Based on the new estimates from sensitivity analyses, R0 was also re-estimated. All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS software, version 9.4.

Process and output of data collection

The process of data collection is summarized in Figure 1 

Characteristics of included cases

The age of included cases ranged from 5 days to 90 years (Table 1 ). There were 122 cases (12.92%) with a travel history to Hubei province where Wuhan is the capital city. The source of exposure of 887 cases was known confirmed cases. The exposure period was exactly 1 day in 426 (50.3%) cases, spanned 2-3 days in 196 (23.1%) cases, and spanned more than 3 days in the other cases (who were not included in estimation of parameters involving exposure date).Among the cases with relevant information (n=329, 28.48%), 49 (14.89%) were asymptomatic, 256 (77.81%) mild to moderate, and 24 (7.29%) severe. The top five initial symptoms were fever (73.92%), cough (24.06%), fatigue (7.49%), malaise (7.20%), and chills (4.03%).Clustering cases accounted for 81.4% of all, and most of them were the second generation. It should be noted that for each generation there were some cases excluded from this study, because no information was available for estimating the parameters of interest.

Epidemiological parameters

Incubation period were estimated from 587 cases, of whom 408 were exposed for 1 day and the others for two or three days. The incubation period of individual cases ranged from 0 to 23 days (Table 2) , with a median of 7 days and 6.64% (n=39) of them longer than 14 days.The estimates from lognormal, Weibull and gamma models were almost the same. Thus, lognormal model was used uniformly for this parameter (Figure 2(A) ). The mean incubation period was estimated at 7.44 days (95% CI: 7.10, 7.78) and the standard deviation 4.39 days (95% CI: 3.97, 4.49).Only 11 pairs of infector-infectee was eligible for estimation of the upper limit of latent period, which ranged from 0 to 5 days (Table 2 ) with a median of 1 day. The mean and standard deviation derived from lognormal model, which fitted the dataset best (Figure 2(B) ), were 2.52 All rights reserved.

The small sample size precluded further analysis.The serial interval was estimated for 689 pairs of infector-infectee and ranged from −5 to 24 days (Table 2) , with a median of 6 days. It was smaller than 0 (mean: −2.63 days) for 27 (3.92%) pairs, meaning that the infectee showed symptoms earlier than the infector. Assuming a normal distribution (Figure 2(C) ), the mean was 6.70 days (95% CI: 6.31, 7.10) and standard deviation 5.20 days (95% CI: 4.91, 5.46).The time point of exposure was estimated from 233 pairs of infector-infectee and ranged from −9 to 13 days (Table 2) , with a median of 0 day. It was smaller than 0 (mean: −3.11 days) for 102 (43.78%) pairs, meaning that the transmission occurred before the infectors showed symptoms. Assuming a normal distribution (Figure 2(D) ), the mean was −0.19 days (95% CI: −0.62, 0.25) and standard deviation 3.32 days (95% CI: 2.97, 3.68).Based on an exponential growth rate of 0.10 per day 1 and the mean (6.7 days) and standard deviation (5.2 days) of the serial interval, R0 was estimated at 1.71 (95% CI: 1.67, 1.75) according to formula (1) . Based on the same exponential growth rate, serial interval and mean of upper limit of latent period (2.52 days), R0 was estimated at 1.78 according to formula (2) .Please note that the 95% CI was not available here as the 95% CI of latent period was not estimated due to limited sample size, i.e., 11 pairs of samples.

Sensitivity and stratified and analyses

In sensitivity analysis, the estimates of incubation period, latent period and time point of exposure remained stable, with a difference of 0.14-0.3 day from those in primary analysis (Table 2) Table 2 ). R0 remained almost the same in sensitivity analysis (data not shown).The results of stratified analysis, where asymptomatic cases were also included, are summarized in Table 3 . The three parameters were consistently associated with disease severity and generation in clusters. Specifically, for those with less severe disease or at lower generations in clusters, the incubation period, interval between their exposure and primary cases' symptom onset, and interval between their symptom onset and primary cases' symptom onset all tend to be longer. For those whose primary cases had less severe disease, the incubation period tends to be longer, while the interval between their symptom onset and primary cases' symptom onset tends to be shorter. No such trend was observed for other factors.

Discussion

By pooling individual data from seven countries, we estimated the mean incubation period of COVID-19 to be 7.44 days, latent period 2.52 days, serial interval 6.70 days, time point of All rights reserved.

The time point of exposure can also be inferred by mean serial interval minus mean incubation time (−0.74 day), which is consistent with the direct estimate (−0.19 day) as both suggest the mean time point of exposure to be around the day before primary cases' symptom onset. Based on the above estimates, the timeline of infection for an 'average' pair of infector-infectee in a transmission chain is demonstrated in Figure 3 .Our estimates of incubation period and serial interval are longer than most of the previous estimates. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] There are several possible reasons for the difference. First, the sample size is generally small in previous studies, 2, 4, 6, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] but much larger in the present one. Second, most cases in previous studies had a long or even unclear interval of exposure, making it difficult to determine the exact exposure date 3, 5, 13 and giving rise to error. By contrast, this study followed strict inclusion criteria regarding exposure period and method to determine exposure date to ensure the potential error in the estimates be small (< 0.3 day, according to the sensitivity analysis). Third, the approaches to determination of transmission order within clusters are different. For the cases involving cluster infection, which represent the majority of all cases, a common practice of previous studies was to take the case with earliest date of symptom onset as infector and others as infectee. 9 However, we deemed it inappropriate in view of the varying incubation periods of individuals and potential pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission.In this study, more rigorous criteria were applied to the inclusion of clusters, and the clusters in which transmission order was uncertain were excluded from relevant analyses. Fourth, different studies used data from different stages of the epidemic. The data of this study was retrieved through late February of 2020, which may reflect more of the situation after strong measures were taken to battle the epidemic in China.Our finding that the incubation period was within 14 days for 93% of the cases lends support to current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In line with other studies, 13 we also found some cases who developed symptoms 14 days after exposure, indicating that longer quarantine periods might be justified for some people.However, as it is hard to know beforehand who will develop symptoms beyond 14 days of exposure, the cost of extending quarantine of many people and the potential consequence of failure to identify a few symptomatic cases must be weighed carefully.The negative values of serial interval and time point of exposure provide evidence of presymptomatic transmission, which are consistent with the much shorter latent period than incubation period. The percentages of negative serial interval (3.92%) and negative time point of exposure (43.78%) can be viewed as the lower and upper limits of probability of presymptomatic transmission, respectively. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed in this study (Table 3 ). These findings are in line with those of previous studies. 8,9,14-17 Stratified analysis in this study found a trend towards longer incubation period of less severe cases as compared with that of more severe cases. This implies that severe cases could be detected and 'removed' from the pool of transmission sources more quickly, while less severe cases would All rights reserved.

In any case, a smaller R0should not be interpreted as low risk of transmission. Slow response of government, presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission and insufficient protection measures taken by the public together could lead to an out-of-control epidemic, as with the current situation in many countries.This study has limitations. First, the cases were retrieved from publicly available reports, and many cases were excluded because there were no details available for estimating the parameters. Thus, the representativeness of cases could be a concern. A comparison of the age and sex of included cases with those of 72314 cases in China showed that they are generally similar. 29 Previous studies suggested that publicly reported cases may overrepresent the severe ones. However, based on 329 cases (28.48%) with relevant information available, non-severe cases appeared to account for a higher proportion in the present study than in the previous one on 72314 cases in China. The second limitation of this study is that the upper limit of latent period was based on only 11 pairs of infector-infectee. Larger studies are needed to obtain a more robust estimate. The third limitation is that by using the upper limit of latent period instead of the real latent period in formula (2), in our case, could lead to a slightly smaller value of R0.If we use a naively small value of the latent period at 0 days (i.e., no latency), the formula (2) would lead to a R0 at 1.67, which can be treated as the lower bound. Hence, under the formula (2), R0 may range from 1.67 to 1.78, which was consistent with those from formula (1), i.e., 1.71 (95% CI: 1.67, 1.75).In conclusion, this study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. It provides additional evidence on the mean incubation period of COVID-19, which supports current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure but also suggests that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggest a high risk of long-term epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures.

","Abstract 24

Protein kinase R (PKR) plays a major role in activating host immunity during infection 25 by sensing dsRNA produced by viruses. Once activated by dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates the 26 translation factor eIF2α, halting cellular translation. Many viruses have methods of inhibiting 27 PKR activation or its downstream effects, circumventing protein synthesis shutdown. These 28 include sequestering dsRNA or producing proteins that bind to and inhibit PKR activation. Here 29 we describe our finding that in multiple cell types, PKR was depleted during mouse adenovirus 30 type 1 (MAV-1) infection. MAV-1 did not appear to be targeting PKR at a transcriptional or 31 translational level because total PKR mRNA levels and levels of PKR mRNA bound to 32 polysomes were unchanged or increased during MAV-1 infection. However, inhibiting the 33 proteasome reduced the PKR depletion seen in MAV-1-infected cells, whereas inhibiting the 34 lysosome had no effect. This suggests that proteasomal degradation alone is responsible for PKR 35 degradation during MAV-1 infection. Time course experiments indicate that the degradation 36 occurs early after infection. Infecting cells with UV-inactivated virus prevented PKR 37 degradation, whereas inhibiting viral DNA replication did not. Together these results suggest that 38 an early viral gene is responsible. Degradation of PKR is a rare mechanism to oppose PKR 39 activity, and it has only been described in six RNA viruses. To our knowledge, this is the first 40 example of a DNA virus counteracting PKR by degrading it. 41 42 Importance 43The first line of defense in cells during viral infection is the innate immune system, which 44 is activated by different viral products. PKR is a part of this innate immune system and is 45 induced by interferon and activated by dsRNA produced by DNA and RNA viruses. PKR is such 46 discovered that the PKR -/-MEF lines used are not complete PKR knockouts (52). There are two 116 categories of PKR -/-MEFs derived from knockout mice: N-PKR -/-MEFs and C-PKR -/-MEFs 117 (52). The PKR -/-MEFs derived from mice created in the Weissmann lab (53) are designated N-118 PKR -/-MEFs, because the C-terminal fragment of PKR is still expressed and can be detected by 119 immunoblot when there is IFN induction (52). The fragment has the kinase catalytic activity of 120 PKR, but it does not bind dsRNA (52). The PKR -/-MEFs derived from mice created in the Bell 121 lab (54) are designated as C-PKR -/-MEFs, because the N-terminal fragment of PKR is still 122 expressed and can be detected by immunoblot with specific PKR antibodies (52). The fragment 123 is catalytically inactive, but it can still bind dsRNA (52). Susceptibility of these PKR -/-MEFs to 124 specific viruses may be dependent on the PKR mutation and the mechanism used by each virus 125 to circumvent PKR. 126

127

To determine whether PKR plays an important role during MAV-1 infection, we tested 128 the susceptibility of both PKR -/-MEF lines to MAV-1 infection. We infected wild type MEFs, 129 N-PKR -/-MEFs, and C-PKR -/-MEFs with MAV-1 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell and collected cell 130 pellets at 48 and 72 hpi. DNA was purified from the cell pellets and analyzed for MAV-1 131

Mouse PKR is depleted during MAV-1 infection. 138

To determine whether MAV-1 affects PKR during infection, we infected several cell 139 types and analyzed PKR protein expression. We infected immortalized C57BL/6 MEFs, 140 C57BL/6 primary peritoneal macrophages, and CMT93 cells (mouse rectal carcinoma cells) with 141 MAV-1 at an MOI of 10 and collected cell lysates 24, 48, and 72 hpi. We analyzed cell lysates 142for the presence of PKR by immunoblot using a polyclonal antibody that detects mouse PKR. 143We probed blots with antibodies to actin as a loading control. To our surprise, in C57BL/6 144 MEFs, PKR was almost completely depleted from lysates 24 hpi and remained depleted through 145 72 hpi ( Fig. 2A and B) . PKR was also depleted compared to mock infection at 24 and 48 hpi in 146 C57BL/6 MEFs infected at MOI 2 and 5 (Fig. S1 ). We also observed depletion of PKR in other 147 cell types. In CMT93 cells, PKR was nearly undetectable at 24 hpi ( Fig. 2A) . In C57BL/6 148 primary peritoneal macrophages, PKR was decreased at 48 hpi compared to mock lysates, and 149 absent in infected lysates at 72 hpi ( Fig. 2A ). This indicates that MAV-1 causes PKR depletion 150 during infection. 151

152

To determine whether kinase activity of PKR is important for the depletion, we assayed 153 infection of MEFs expressing a mutant form of mouse PKR with a point mutation in the kinase 154 domain (K271R) (55). These cells, designated K271R SV40-MEFs, showed an even more rapid 155 depletion of PKR than in WT SV40-MEFs (Fig. 2C) . At 24 hpi, in K271R SV40-MEFs, 28% of 156 PKR remained, compared to 60% in the WT SV40-MEFs. The fraction remaining at 72 hpi in K271R SV40-MEFs suggests that the upper band of the PKR doublet usually seen in wild-type 161 cells is a phospho-PKR band, because only the lower band of the PKR doublet is seen in kinase-162 dead mutant K271R SV40-MEFs. The data in Fig. 2A and C thus indicate that both PKR and 163 phospho-PKR are depleted during MAV-1 infection. 164

MAV-1 does not cause PKR depletion by reducing steady-state levels of PKR mRNA 166

To determine the mechanism of PKR depletion, we first assayed whether reduction in 167 PKR protein during MAV-1 infection was due to reduced PKR mRNA steady-state levels. We 168 mock-infected or infected C57BL/6 MEFs and primary peritoneal macrophages at an MOI of 10 169 and collected cell lysates at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. We synthesized cDNA from RNA purified from 170 these cell lysates and assayed for PKR mRNA by qPCR. In C57BL/6 MEFs, PKR mRNA levels 171were similar between mock and infected lysates at 24 hpi (Fig. 3A) , a time point in which PKR 172 protein levels were already greatly depleted in the infected lysates compared to mock lysates 173 (Fig. 2) . Although PKR mRNA levels were depleted 33% at 48 hpi and 40% 72 hpi in MAV-1-174infected lysates compared to mock lysates, this does not correlate to the 84% and 94% reduction, 175 respectively, in PKR protein levels at those time points (Fig. 2B ). In C57BL/6 primary peritoneal 176 macrophages, PKR mRNA levels in the infected lysates were 2-3 times higher than levels in 177 mock lysates at all three time points assayed (Fig. 3B) , even though PKR protein levels were 178 almost completely depleted in infected lysates at 72 hpi (Fig. 2) . This is evidence that MAV-1 is 179 not causing PKR protein depletion by reducing PKR steady-state mRNA levels during infection. 180

MAV-1 infection effects on PKR translation 184

Because MAV-1 did not reduce PKR mRNA steady-state levels, we determined whether 185 MAV-1 causes PKR depletion by reducing translation of its mRNA. We first assayed total PKR 186 mRNA bound to ribosomes during infection. C57BL/6 MEFs were mock infected or infected at 187 an MOI of 5, and lysates were collected at 48 hpi in the presence of cycloheximide to keep the 188 mRNA bound to the ribosomes (56). Lysates were centrifuged through 25% sucrose to pellet 189 ribosomes, and RNA was purified from the pellets. The purified RNAs were used to generate 190 cDNA, which we assayed for PKR mRNA by qPCR. As a control for pelleting of ribosomes, we 191 assayed the pellets and sucrose cushion supernatants by immunoblot with antibodies to 192 ribosomal protein RPL7. We confirmed that RPL7 was only present in the pellets and not the 193 supernatants (Fig. S2 ). There was no significant difference between the amount of PKR mRNA 194 in the ribosome pellet of mock infected lysates compared to MAV-1-infected lysates (Fig. 4A) . 195 196 To confirm the results seen in total mRNA bound to ribosomes, we also centrifuged cell 197 extracts on sucrose gradients to generate polysome profiles. This enabled us to analyze levels of 198 PKR mRNA associated with actively-translating ribosomes during infection. C57BL/6 MEFs 199 were mock infected or infected at an MOI of 2, and lysates were collected at 24 hpi in the 200 presence of cycloheximide, as above. RNA content for mock and infected lysates was estimated 201 by NanoDrop spectrophotometry, and equivalent OD amounts of RNA were centrifuged on 10-202 50% sucrose gradients to sediment 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, 80S ribosomes 203 (monosomes), and polyribosomes (polysomes). A typical polysome profile was obtained (Fig. 204 4B) . RNA was purified from fractions containing monosomes and polysomes and then used to 205 generate cDNA, which we assayed for PKR mRNA by qPCR (Fig. 4C) . As a control, GAPDH 206 mRNA was measured by qPCR, and PKR mRNA levels in each fraction were normalized to the 207 GAPDH mRNA content. When the data for percentage of PKR mRNA bound to ribosomes was 208 pooled into monosome and polysome fractions and analyzed (Fig. 4D) , 90.1% and 91.8% were 209 bound to polysomes (fractions 7-19) for mock and infected samples, respectively, compared to 210 9.9% and 8.2% bound to monosomes (fractions 1-6). We performed two additional polysome 211 gradient analyses. The pooled data from all three (Fig. 4E ) were similar to the data for Fig. 4D , 212i.e., 82.7% and 92.7% of PKR mRNA were bound to mock and infected polysomes, respectively, 213 compared to 17.3% and 7.3% bound to monosomes. Thus, PKR protein depletion during MAV-1 214 infection does not appear to stem from a decrease in PKR mRNA translation. 215

216

We also assayed whether PKR mRNA might have a signal that would reduce its 217 translation during MAV-1 infection. We constructed a plasmid that positioned sequence 218 corresponding to the 5' UTR of PKR mRNA upstream of a reporter nanoluciferase gene (57), 219 transfected it into C57BL/6 MEFs, then infected with MAV-1. Compared to cells transfected 220 with a control plasmid with the human -globin 5' UTR upstream of the reporter nanoluciferase, 221 there was no significant difference in luciferase activity between mock infected and infected 222 samples (Fig. S3 ). These data suggest that MAV-1 is not affecting PKR translation through 223 interaction with the 5' UTR of PKR. The data are consistent with the ribosome pellet and 224 polysome data that MAV-1 infection does not reduce PKR mRNA translation. 225 226 PKR is depleted by proteasomal degradation during MAV-1 infection. 227There are two main proteolysis pathways in cells, proteasomal degradation and lysosomal 228 degradation (58). To determine whether MAV-1 depletes PKR by either protein degradation 229 pathway, we first assayed whether PKR is lysosomally degraded as follows. CMT93 cells were 230 mock infected or infected with MAV-1 and treated at the time of infection with the lysosome 231 inhibitors ammonium chloride or chloroquine, or water (as a control). At 24 hpi, we collected 232 lysates and analyzed them by immunoblot with antibodies to PKR. In the presence of the 233 lysosomal degradation inhibitors, PKR was depleted by 24 hpi (Fig. 5A) , indicating that 234 lysosomal degradation was not the cause of PKR depletion during MAV-1 infection. We 235 confirmed that the inhibitor treatment did block lysosomal degradation by incubating cells with 236 dye-quenched bovine serum albumin (DQ BSA) in addition to the lysosomal inhibitors. DQ BSA 237 is self-quenched until it is digested in the lysosome (59, 60), and imaging confirmed that cells 238 treated with lysosome inhibitors did not fluoresce, but cells treated with the vehicle control 239 (H 2 O) did, as expected (Fig. 5B) . 240 241 Next, we examined whether proteasomal degradation is responsible for the degradation of 242 PKR by using proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib. These inhibit proteasome activity 243 by binding to the active sites in the 20S subunit and blocking the proteolytic activity (61-63). We 244 mock infected or infected C57BL/6 MEFs with MAV-1 and treated with MG132 or bortezomib 245 in DMSO at the time of infection. At 24 hpi, we collected lysates and analyzed them by 246 immunoblot for PKR protein levels. While PKR was depleted in the control DMSO-treated 247 MAV-1-infected cells as expected, PKR protein was present in the MG132-and bortezomib-248 treated cells at levels comparable to mock infected cells ( Fig. 6A and B ). To rule out the 249 possibility that PKR was present (not depleted) because the virus infection itself was inhibited by 250 MG132 or bortezomib, we assayed viral replication of MAV-1 with MG132 and bortezomib 251 treatment by qPCR of viral DNA. Viral replication was equivalent in all three treatment groups 252 ( Fig. S4) , indicating that the treatments did not affect the ability of the virus to productively 253 infect the cells. Taken together, these data indicate that MAV-1 infection results in PKR 254 depletion by causing PKR to be degraded by the proteasome during infection. 255

256

A signal for proteasomal degradation is the conjugation of ubiquitin to a protein (64, 65). 257We examined whether PKR is ubiquitinated by immunoblot. We detected ubiquitination of a 258 positive control, mouse p53, which is degraded in the presence of MAV-1 proteins (66). 259However, even with the use of epitope-tagged ubiquitin (67) and MG132 treatment, we were 260 unable to detect PKR ubiquitination during infection (Fig. S5 ). This is consistent with an 261 inability to detect PKR ubiquitination when it is degraded during RVFV infection (32). Although 262 RVFV NSs is known to recruit an E3 ligase to PKR, the authors reported that ubiquitinated PKR 263 is undetectable. Therefore, the cellular degradation signal for PKR remains unclear. 264

PKR is actively depleted early in infection. 266

We investigated when proteasomal degradation of PKR occurs. Early viral proteins are 267 expressed prior to viral DNA replication, which is then followed by late viral protein expression. 268First, we examined the kinetics of PKR degradation to determine whether an early or late viral 269 protein was likely responsible. We mock infected and infected CMT93 cells with MAV-1 at an 270 MOI of 10 and collected lysates every six hours for 24 hours and analyzed them by immunoblot 271 with antibodies to PKR or MAV-1 early region 1A (E1A) protein, the first viral protein made 272 during infection (68). In infected cells, PKR degradation was first detected at 12 hpi (Fig. 7A) , 273 and quantitation of five independent experiments showed that ~20% of the starting levels of PKR 274 protein remained at 24 hpi ( Fig 7B) . 275 .

After 24 hours of cycloheximide treatment, approximately 90% of the starting levels of The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/584680 doi: bioRxiv preprintWe addressed whether viral DNA replication is needed for PKR degradation. We mock 299 infected or infected CMT93 cells with MAV-1 at an MOI of 10 and treated them with cytosine 300 arabinoside (araC) at the time of infection to inhibit DNA synthesis (69, 70) . This would allow 301 the virus to infect the cell and produce early viral proteins, but would inhibit viral DNA 302 replication and prevent late protein synthesis. We collected lysates at 20 and 40 hpi and analyzed 303 them by immunoblot. We confirmed that araC treatment resulted in no late protein synthesis by 304 performing an immunoblot for late virion proteins (Fig. S8 ). In samples treated with araC, PKR 305 degradation was seen at 20 and 40 hpi ( We have demonstrated here that PKR is antiviral in MAV-1 infections of cultured cells. 312Surprisingly, MAV-1 infection of primary and established cultured cells depleted PKR. The 313 depletion was not due to reduced steady-state levels or reduced translation of PKR mRNA. 314Instead, we showed that PKR depletion is inhibited by proteasome inhibitors, implicating 315 proteasomal degradation of PKR. Several lines of evidence suggest that the degradation is due to 316 a viral early function. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

When we infected PKR -/-323 MEFs with MAV-1, viral DNA yields were 5 to 6 times higher than viral DNA yields from wild 324 type MEFs (Fig. 1) , indicating that PKR plays an antiviral role during MAV-1 infection. At 48 325 hpi, the viral DNA yield from the N-MEFs was nearly 4 times higher than the C-MEFs, but by 326 72 hpi the viral DNA yields from both types of PKR -/-MEFs were similar to each other and 327significantly increased compared to wild type MEFs (Fig. 1) . This difference in viral replication 328 kinetics between the two types of PKR -/-MEFs may be due to differences in expression level and 329 activity of the PKR fragments reportedly produced by them; we have not assayed PKR fragment 330 production in our cells. 331

332

We examined PKR protein levels during MAV-1 infection and found that PKR was 333 depleted from the cells as early as 12 hpi (Fig. 7) . Depletion was seen in a wide variety of cell 334 types, including immortalized C57BL/6 MEFs, primary C57BL/6 peritoneal macrophages, and 335 CMT93 mouse colon carcinoma cells. Once depleted, PKR protein levels never returned to mock 336 infected PKR protein levels during infection. Activation (transautophosphorylation) of PKR (6-337 9) was not required for this depletion, because kinase-dead mouse PKR was also depleted from 338 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

While PKR mRNAs in C57BL/6 MEFs were depleted 33% at 48 hpi and 40% at 72 346 hpi compared to mock lysates, this is not sufficient to explain the 84% and 94% reduction, 347 respectively, in PKR protein levels at those time points (Fig. 2B ).

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/584680 doi: bioRxiv preprintWe considered whether reduced PKR levels were due to reduced PKR protein translation. 368There was no change in the total amount of PKR mRNA bound to ribosomes during infection 369 compared to uninfected cells, nor was there a significant change in the amount of actively 370 translating PKR mRNA during infection (Fig. 4) . We also found that the 5' UTR of mouse PKR 371 This indicates that PKR is not degraded by lysosomal degradation during viral infection, but by 378 proteasomal degradation. Though PKR degradation was due to proteasome activity during 379 MAV-1 infection, we were unable to demonstrate PKR ubiquitination, although we did detect 380 ubiquitination of mouse p53 (Fig. S5 ). This inability to demonstrate PKR ubiquitination could be 381 explained if at any given moment there were only low levels of ubiquitinated PKR present in the 382 cell. Perhaps, increasing the time under MG132 treatment could increase the amounts of 383 ubiquitinated proteins enough so that PKR ubiquitination could be seen. However, our inability 384 to detect ubiquitinated PKR is consistent with a similar inability to identify PKR ubiquitination 385 by RVFV NSs, even though NSs is known to recruit an E3 ligase to PKR (32). Alternatively, it is 386 possible that in MAV-1 infection, PKR is degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner, possibly 387 because of intrinsic disordered regions of PKR or binding of regulating proteins to PKR that 388 target proteins to the proteasome (74, 75). 389 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/584680 doi: bioRxiv preprintOur experiments indicate that MAV-1 actively depletes PKR early in infection. Ongoing 390 experiments are focused on determining the MAV-1 early protein(s) responsible for PKR 391 degradation. Two possibilities are E4 proteins, the homologs of hAd E4orf6 and E4orf3, which 392 we originally termed E4orfa/b and E4orfa/c, respectively (76). In human adenovirus, E4orf6 393 interacts with another early hAd protein, E1B 55K, to participate in an E3 ligase complex that 394 ubiquitinates and degrades p53 via proteasomal degradation (77, 78). When MAV-1 E4orf6, 395 E1B 55K, and mouse p53 are introduced by transfection into human cells, all three proteins 396 interact and mouse p53 is degraded (66). If MAV-1 E4orf6 and E1B 55K form a similar complex 397 in mouse cells, it may also degrade PKR. We have preliminary evidence that mouse p53 is 398 ubiquitinated in C57BL/6 MEFs during MAV-1 infection, which suggests that the mouse p53 399 degradation seen in human cells could be paralleled by degradation of endogenous mouse p53 400 and mouse PKR in mouse cells, mediated by MAV-1 E4orf6 and E1B 55K during infection. 401Another hAd E4 protein, E4orf3, causes proteasomal degradation of transcriptional intermediary 402 factor 1 (79) and general transcription factor II-I (80) in a manner independent of hAd E4orf6 403 and E1B 55K. E4orf3 has SUMO E3 ligase and E4 elongase activity and induces sumoylation of 404 general transcription factor II-I, leading to its proteasome-dependent degradation (80). MAV-1 405E4orf3 may similarly have sumoylation activity that results ultimately in proteasome-dependent 406 PKR degradation. Another possibility of a viral protein involved in PKR degradation is the 407 protease encoded by MAV-1. The hAd protease is encapsidated in virions and proteolytically 408 processes viral proteins IIIa, VI, VII, VIII, mu, and TP (81-84). However, we think it is unlikely 409 that the MAV-1 protease degrades PKR, because we showed that UV-inactivated virus was 410 unable to degrade PKR. We assume that UV treatment would not destroy the MAV-1 protease 411 .

In summary, we demonstrated that PKR has an antiviral role during MAV-1 infection in 415 vitro, because when PKR is mutated, viral replication in MEFs is significantly higher compared 416 to wild type MEFs. Analysis of global PKR steady-state protein levels during infection showed containing 5% or 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), respectively, before use. 432Primary peritoneal macrophages were obtained from 6-10 week old C57BL/6 mice purchased 433 from Jackson Laboratory (#000664) as described (87).

The 435abdominal skin was carefully removed, exposing the peritoneum, which was then injected with 5 436 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The abdomen was massaged gently, then the PBS 437 containing the peritoneal macrophages was carefully withdrawn. The macrophages were 438 centrifuged at 100 x g for 4 minutes, red blood cells lysed in lysis buffer (0.15 M ammonium 439 chloride, 1 mM potassium bicarbonate, and 0.1 mM EDTA disodium salt) for 2 minutes at room 440 temperature, centrifuged at 100 x g for 4 minutes, washed twice in PBS, resuspended in DMEM 441 + 5% heat-inactivated FBS, and plated in 6 well plates.

"Abstract

The paper will attempt to estimate factors which determine the variability of case fatality rates of COVID-19 across OCED countries in recent time. The objective of the paper is to estimate the impact of government health policy on fatality rates (Case fatality rates) of COVID-19 in countries while controlling for other demographic and economic characteristics. The analysis is of done using non-parametric regression method, i.e. Quantile regression. The result from quartile regressions analysis shows that a policy of Austerity (health expenditure cuts) significantly increases the mortality rates of COVID-19 in OCED countries. The policy implication of the study is the need for a robust public-funded health system with wider accessibility to deals with a major public health crisis like a COVID-19 pandemic.

","Introduction:

The contemporary world is facing an unprecedented public health crisis of emerging from Covid-19. Covid-19 has spread to 200 countries and infected 877422 people across the world. Out of total infected people across the globe, nearly 43537 has died, and 185241 has recovered till 1 st April 2020 (CSSE, 2020) . After the outbreak of Covid-19 and declaration of its being Pandemic by WHO, there has been a massive increase in the volume of research on Covid-19 (Heymann & Shindo, 2020; Novel, 2020) . However, most research is limited to clinical perspective including SARS Cov-2 reproduction rate (Liu et al., 2020) , fatality ratio (Onder et al., 2020; Wu & McGoogan, 2020) , asymptotic transmission mode (Bai et al., 2020) and other epidemiological characteristics (Atkeson, 2020; Lipsitch et al., 2020; Remuzzi & Remuzzi, 2020; Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . The countries across the globe have responded with various measures including rapid testing of population, isolating suspected individuals, imposing strict social distancing norms, totally shut down of economic activities in the form of lockdowns (Ebrahim et al., 2020; Kupferschmidt & Cohen, 2020; Tanne et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2020) . The economic impact of Covid-19 for different regions and countries are studied using different (Abiad et al., 2020; Atkeson, 2020; Fernandes, 2020; Hartley & Makridis, 2020; McKibbin & Fernando, 2020; Ruiz Estrada, 2020) .

Objective of Research:

Review of existing literature on Covid-19 shows the dynamic interplay between the Covid 19 and the country-specific health policy is still missing. This paper attempts to fill this gap by highlighting the interrelationship between the long term structural health policies and the Covid 19 fatality rates among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries 2 . Definition of Austerity policies is a widespread cut on government expenditure which is targeted to reduce government fiscal deficit and enhance economic growth (Konzelmann, 2014; ) . Such a significant reduction in government spending has a disproportionately negative impact on government social sector expenditure (Health, Education, social security etc.) The negative impact of austerity policies in terms of lowering employment, economic growth and increasing inequality is well studied (Blyth, 2013; Krugman, 2015; Stiglitz, 2012; UNCTAD, 2017) . In the post.-2008 crisis period and under the impact of rising debts burdens, many countries in European counties imposed a policy of austerity in 2010. The most severe austerity policies were implemented in Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Spain and Portugal (Leschke et al., 2015) . Among the OCED group, there is variation in the extent of reduction in their health expenditure in pursuit of Austerity policies(fiscal consolidation) across countries (Van Gool & Pearson, 2014) . The negative impact of such drastic funding cuts on access to health facilities and health indicators is well documented in many OCED countries (Antonakakis & Collins, 2014; Ayuso-Mateos et al., 2013; Ifanti et al., 2013; Kentikelenis et al., 2014 Kentikelenis et al., , 2014 Kentikelenis et al., , 2014 Loopstra et al., 2016 Loopstra et al., , 2016 McKee et al., 2012 McKee et al., , 2012 Reeves et al., 2014 Reeves et al., , 2014 Ruckert & Labonté, 2017; Stuckler et al., 2017) . So under the background of such drastic cuts in health expenditure, the papers will evaluate the impact of austerity policies (health expenditure cuts) on fatality rates of Covid-19 after controlling for other socio-demographic characteristics which have a significant impact on fatality rates of covid-19. The fatality rates are measured by crude Case fatality rates (CFC), which is the ratio of confirmed death to confirmed positive cases of covid-19 for each country.

Data source and Methodology:

The data source for analysis is taken from different data sources. Following is the table providing a list of variable and their data source. The data for analysis is from thirty The analysis of the impact of austerity on covid regression after controlling for all other socio impact on Case fatality rate (Novel, 2020; Onder et al., 2020; Porcheddu et al., 2020; Wu & McGoogan, 2020) . The advantage of quantile regression over norm regression (OLS) regression is that it gives a rich picture of the relationship between variables not only around mean value but across the distribution of variables 2001). It is distribution-free, robust distribution (Baum, 2013 ; Cad Share of the population having diabetic condition above 18hypertenion18 WHO-Global heath observatory data, 2019Share of the population having a high blood pressure condition abo age.om thirty-six countries 3 from the OECD group. shows that large part of infection and deaths from Co is concentrated in OECD regions only.the impact of austerity on covid-19 fatality rates is done using regression after controlling for all other socio-demographic characteristics which have an (Novel, 2020; Onder et al., 2020; Porcheddu et al., 2020 ; Wu & The advantage of quantile regression over normal Ordinary least square regression is that it gives a rich picture of the relationship between variables not only around mean value but across the distribution of variables (Koenker & Hallock, free, robust to outliers, capable of modelling entire conditional (Baum, 2013; Cade & Noon, 2003; Yu et al., 2003) . 19 fatality rates is done using Quantile demographic characteristics which have an (Novel, 2020; Onder et al., 2020; Porcheddu et al., 2020; Wu & Ordinary least square regression is that it gives a rich picture of the relationship between variables (Koenker & Hallock, outliers, capable of modelling entire conditional OECD 77% 

Statistical Analysis:

The The average value of public spending in health to GDP variable, publichelathgdp, is 5.95 % and it has a minimum value from 0.9 per cent and the maximum value of 14.4 per cent. The existing clinical research shows that fatality rate of Covid-19 is influenced by the existence of pre-medical complication and the share of older adults in the population (Onder et al., 2020; Wu & McGoogan, 2020) . The crucial demographic variable, population share above 65 years (popu65), has a mean value of 15 per cent and a standard deviation of 5.4. The share of the population having hypertension (above 18 years age) has a minimum value of 13 % and a maximum value of 38.2 %.b. Quantile Regression: Table 3 shows the result of Quantile regression. The first model has a case fatality rate from March 30 as the dependent variable. In the second model, the dependent variable is the threeday median case fatality rate. The result from both models shows that the coefficient of the dummy variable for high fund cut has a positive impact on CFR and is significant at one per cent level of significance. The result shows that a country which has a history of drastic health fund cut is increasing the fatality rates from covid-19. Similarly, the coefficient of the variable of public health GDP is negative and significant at one per cent level of significance.It shows that countries which have a higher share of the public-funded health system have a lower case fatality rate. The impact of good health infrastructure (measured by bed per 1000 population and doctor per 1000 population) on case fatality rates is negative. As expected in exiting literature higher population having a higher old age has higher fatality rates. Also, the higher share of preexisting medical condition in the overall population, higher is the fatality rate from COVID-19.

Table 4: Model Specification Test: Link Test of Model-1

The presence of model specification error is done using the link test. If the regression model does not contain specification error, then the variable _hatsq will be statistically insignificant. Table 4 shows the result of the link test for Model -1. The P-value of variable _hatsq is 0.16, and hence it is statistically insignificant. So model-1 does not contain specification error. Similarly, the link test result of model-2 also shows that variable _hatsq is not statistically significant. Hence model-2 does not contain specification error.In order to gets idea about coefficient of Quantile regression of independent variables across quantile of case fatality rates following two figure has been calculated using the Azevedo method (Azevedo, 2011) . It shows how the impact of each independent variable varies across quantiles. .

The coefficient of doctor per 1000 population is negative across the distribution of case fatality ratio (except for the second quantile). The coefficient of hospital bed per 1000 population is negative across the distribution of case fatality ratio (except till the fourth quantile).

Conclusion:

The result from the Quantile regression analysis shows that country which has pursued austerity policies has significantly higher fatality rates from COVID-19 after controlling for all other socio-demographic factors which influence case fatality rate of COVID-19. Higher public funding share, higher doctors per population, higher bed availability is associated with lower fatality rates from COVID-19. A higher share of the population with pre-medical conditions (diabetics, hypertension) and older age population increase fatality rates. So the policies of austerity (at least in terms of reduction in health expenditure) can significantly worsen health system ability to fight pandemic live COVID-19 and can lead to a severe negative health outcome. The policy implication of the study is the need for a robust publicfunded health system with wider accessibility to deals with a major public health crisis like a covid-19 pandemic.

"Abstract

The same nucleotide sequence can encode two protein products in different reading frames. Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than non-overlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains 32% or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.

","I. INTRODUCTION

Protein-coding genes sometimes overlap, i.e. the same nucleotide sequence encodes different proteins in different reading frames. Most of the overlapping pairs of genes that have been characterized to date are found in viral, bacterial and mitochondrial genomes, with emerging research showing that they may be common in eukaryotic genomes as well [10] , [20] , [31] , [32] , [37] . Studying overlapping genes can shed light on the processes of de novo gene birth [36] .Overlapping genes tend to encode proteins with higher intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than those encoded by non-overlapping genes [36] . The term disorder applies broadly to proteins which, at least in the absence of a binding partner, lack a stable secondary and tertiary structure. There are different degrees of disorder: molten globules, partially unstructured proteins and random coils with regions of disorder spanning from short (less than 30 residues in length) to long. Disorder can be shown experimentally or predicted from amino acid sequences using software [15] . [36] estimated, using the latter approach, that 48% of amino acids in overlapping regions exhibit disorder, compared to only 23% in non-overlapping regions.In this work we explore three non-mutually-exclusive hypotheses why this might be, and quantify the extent of each. Two have previously been considered: that elevated ISD in overlapping genes is a mechanism that relieves evolutionary constraint, and that elevated ISD is a holdover from the de novo gene birth process. We add consideration of a third, previously-unexplored hypothesis -that elevated ISD with dual-coding may be the result of an artifact of the genetic code -to the mix.Overlapping genes are particularly evolutionarily constrained because a mutation in an overlapping region simultaneously affects both of the two (or occasionally more) genes involved in that overlap. Because ∼70% of mutations that occur in the third codon position are synonymous, versus only ∼5% and 0% of mutations in the first and second codon positions respectively [38] , a mutation that is synonymous in one reading frame is highly likely to be nonsynonymous in another, so to permit adaptation, overlapping genes must be relatively tolerant of nonsynonymous changes. Demonstrating the higher constraint on overlapping regions, they have lower genetic diversity and d N /d S than non-overlapping regions in RNA viruses [25] , [39] , [40] , [43] .High ISD can alleviate the problem of constraint. Amino acid substitutions that maintain disorder have a reasonable chance of being tolerated, in contrast to the relative fragility of a well-defined three-dimensional structure. This expectation is confirmed by the higher evolutionary rates observed for disordered proteins [4] , [13] . The known elevation of evolutionary constraint on overlapping genes is usually invoked as the sole [47] , [53] or at least dominant [36] explanation for their high ISD. Given the strength of the evidence for constraint [25] , [39] , [40] , [43] , we attribute to constraint, by a process of elimination, what cannot be explained by our other two hypotheses.The second hypothesis that we consider is that high ISD in overlapping genes is an artifact of the process of de novo gene birth [36] . There is no plausible path by which two non-overlapping genes could re-encode an equivalent protein sequence as overlapping; instead, an overlapping pair arises either when a second gene is born de novo within an existing gene, or when the boundaries of an existing gene are extended to create overlap [38] . In the latter case of ""overprinting"" [7] , [19] , [36] , the extended portion of that gene, if not the whole gene, is born de novo. One overlapping protein-coding sequence is therefore always evolutionarily younger than the other; we refer to these as ""novel"" versus ""ancestral"" overlapping genes or portions of genes. Genes may eventually lose their overlap through a process of gene duplication followed by subfunctionalization [19] , enriching overlapping genes for relatively young genes that have not yet been through this process. However, gene duplication may be inaccessible to many viruses (in particular, many RNA, ssDNA, and retroviruses), due to intrinsic geometric constraints on maximum nucleotide length [6] , [9] , [11] .Young genes are known to have higher ISD than old genes, with high ISD at the moment of gene birth facilitating the process [52] , perhaps because cells tolerate them better [48] . Domains that were more recently born de novo also have higher ISD [3] , [5] , [14] , [26] . High ISD could be helpful in itself in creating novel function, or it could be a byproduct of a hydrophilic amino acid composition whose function is simply the avoidance of harmful protein aggregation [16] , [22] . Regardless of the cause of high ISD in young genes, the ""facilitate birth"" hypothesis makes a distinct prediction from the constraint hypothesis, namely that the novel overlapping reading frames will tend to encode higher ISD than the ancestral overlapping reading frames.Under the constraint hypothesis, ancestral overlapping proteins will still have elevated ISD relative to non-overlapping proteins, even if it is less elevated than that of novel overlapping proteins. Elevated ISD in the ancestral member of the gene pair might have already been there at the moment of gene birth, or it might have subsequently evolved, representing two subhypotheses within the overall hypothesis of constraint. The overlapping gene pairs that we observe are those that have been retained; if either member of the overlapping pair was born with low ISD, then constraint makes it difficult to adapt to a changing environment, and that pair is less likely to be retained. When the ancestral member of the pair already has high ISD at the moment at which the novel gene is functionalized, long-term maintenance of both genes in the face of constraint is more likely. The ""already there"" or ""preadaptation"" [52] version of the constraint hypothesis predicts that the pre-overlapping ancestors of today's ancestral overlapping genes had higher ISD than other genes, perhaps because these gene pairs are the ones to have been retained. While these ancestral sequences are not available, as a proxy we use homologous sequences from basal lineages whose most recent common ancestry predates the origin of the overlap. For simplicity, we refer to these sequences as ""pre-overlapping"" to distinguish them from ""non-overlapping"" genes never known to have overlap. The preadaptation version of the constraint hypothesis predicts higher ISD in pre-overlapping genes than in non-overlapping genes.Finally, here we also consider the possibility that the high ISD observed in overlapping genes might simply be an artifact of the genetic code [21] . We perform for the first time the appropriate control, by predicting what the ISD would be if codons were read from alternative reading frames of existing non-overlapping genes. Any DNA sequence can be read in three reading frames on each of the two strands, for a total of 6 reading frames. We focus only on same-strand overlap, due to superior availability of reliable data on same-strand overlapping gene pairs. We classify the reading frame of each gene in an overlapping pair relative to its counterpart; if gene A is in the +1 frame with respect to gene B, this means that gene B is in the +2 frame with respect to gene A. We use the +0 frame designation just for nonoverlapping or pre-overlapping genes in their original frame. If the high ISD of overlapping genes is primarily driven by the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, then we expect their ISD values to closely match those expected from translation in the +1 vs. +2 frames of non-overlapping genes.

Hypothesis ISD Prediction

Artifact of the Here we test the predictions of all three hypotheses, as summarized in Figure 1 , and find that both the birthfacilitation and conflict-resolution hypotheses play a role. The artifact hypothesis plays no appreciable role in elevating the ISD of overlapping regions; while reading frame (+1 vs. +2) strongly affects the ISD of individual genes, each overlapping gene pair has one of each, and the two cancel out such that there is no net contribution to the high ISD found in overlapping regions. Surprisingly, novel genes are more likely to be born in the frame prone to lower ISD; this seems to be a case where mutation bias in the availability of open reading frames (ORFs) is more important than selection favoring higher ISD for novel than ancestral genes.

A. Overlapping Viral Genes

A total of 102 viral same-strand overlapping gene pairs were compiled from the literature [35] , [36] , [40] , [42] , [43] , [51] . Of these, ten were discarded because one or both of the genes involved in the overlap were not found in the ncbi databases, either because the accession number had been removed, or because the listed gene could not be located. This left 92 gene pairs for analysis from 80 different species, spanning 33 viral families. Six of these pairs were ssDNA, five were retroviruses, while the remaining 81 were RNA viruses: 7 dsRNA, 61 positive sense RNA and 13 negative sense RNA.

B. Relative Gene Age

For 39 of the remaining 92 gene pairs available for analysis, the identity of the older vs. younger member of the pair had been classified in the literature [27] , [36] , [40] , [42] via phylogenetic analysis. There was disagreement in the literature regarding the TGBp2/TGBp3 overlap; we followed [27] rather than [36] .We also used relative levels of codon bias to classify the relative ages of members of each pair. Because all of the overlapping genes are from viral genomes, we can assume that they are highly expressed, leading to a strong expectation of codon bias in general. Novel genes are expected to have less extreme codon bias than ancestral genes due to evolutionary inertia [35] , [40] .For each viral species, codon usage data [29] , [55] were used to calculate a relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) value for each codon [17] :is the number of occurrences of codon i in the viral genome, and 1 ≤ n ≤ 6 is the number of synonymous codons which code for the same amino acid as codon i. The relative adaptedness value (w i ) for each codon in a viral species was then calculated as:where RSCU max is the RSCU value for the most frequently occurring codon corresponding to the amino acid associated with codon i. The codon adaptation index (CAI) was then calculated for the overlapping portion of each gene, as the geometric mean of the relative adaptedness values:where L is the number of codons in the overlapping portion of the gene, excluding ATG and TGG codons. This exclusion is because ATG and TGG are the only codons that code for their respective amino acids and so their relative adaptedness values are always 1, thereby introducing no new information. To ensure sufficient statistical power to differentiate between CAI values, we did not analyze CAI for gene pairs with overlapping sections less than 200 nucleotides long.Within each overlapping pair, we provisionally classified the gene with the higher CAI value as ancestral and the gene with lower CAI value as novel. We then compared the two sets of relative adaptedness valuesusing the wilcox.test function in R to perform a Mann-Whitney U Test. We chose a p-value cutoff of 0.035 after analyzing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot ( Figure 2A ). The combined effects of our length threshold and p-value cutoff are illustrated in Figure 2B . In total, 27 gene pairs were determined to have statistically-significant CAI values, 19 of which had also been classified via phylogenetic analysis. Of the gene pairs whose ancestral vs. novel classification were obtained both by statistically significant CAI differences and by phylogenetics, there was one for which the CAI classification contradicted the phylogenetics. That exception was the p104/p130 overlap in the Providence virus. This overlap is notable because the ancestral member of the pair was acquired through horizontal gene transfer, which renders codon usage an unreliable predictor of relative gene ages [35] . We therefore used the phylogenetic classification and disregarded the CAI results. In total, we were able to classify ancestral vs. novel status for 47 overlapping gene pairs (Figure 3 ).

C. Non-overlapping and Pre-overlapping Controls

Both non-overlapping genes and pre-overlapping genes were used as controls. 150 non-overlapping genes were compiled from the viral species in which the 92 overlapping gene pairs were found; matching for species helps control for %GC content or other idiosyncrasies of nucleotide composition.Of the 47 overlapping gene pairs for which we could assign relative ages, we were able to locate preoverlapping homologs for 27 of the ancestral genes in our dataset in the literature [40] and/or NCBI (BLAST search with E-value threshold = 10 −6 ).Frameshifting these control sequences was performed in two ways. First, removing one or two nucleotides immediately after the start codon and two or one nucleotides immediately before the stop codon generated +1 and +2 frameshifted non-ORF controls, respectively ( Figure 4A ). Any stop codons that appeared in the new reading frames were removed.Second, for the frameshifted ORF controls, we took only in situ ORFs within each of the two alternative reading frames. If multiple ORFs terminated at the same stop codon, we used only the longest. We excluded ORFs less than 25 amino acids in length (after removal of cysteines for analysis by IUPred). For nonoverlapping genes, this yielded 151 and 24 ORFs in the +1 and +2 reading frames, respectively. For the smaller set of pre-overlapping genes, it yielded only 25 and 5 ORFs in the +1 and +2 frames, respectively.

D. Homology Groups

Treating each gene as an independent datapoint is a form of pseudoreplication, because homologous genes can share properties via a common ancestor rather than via independent evolution. This problem of phylogenetic confounding can be corrected for by using gene family as a random effect term in a linear model [52] , and by counting each gene birth event only once.We constructed a pHMMer (http://hmmer. org/) database including all overlapping regions, nonoverlapping genes and their frameshifted controls. After an all-against-all search, sequences that were identified as homologous, using an expectation value threshold of 10 −4 , were provisionally assigned the same homology group ID. These provisional groups were used to determine which gene birth events were unique. Two pairs were considered to come from the same gene birth event when both the ancestral and the overlapping sequence were classified as homologous. We also used published phylogenetic analysis to classify the TGBp2/TGBp3 overlap as two birth events (one occurring Virgaviridae, the other occurring in Alphaand Betaflexiviridae) [27] .Some homologous pairs had such dissimilar protein sequences that ISD values were essentially independent. We therefore manually analyzed sequence similarity within each homology group using the Geneious [18] aligner with free end gaps, using Blosum62 as the cost matrix. The percent similarity using the Blosum62 matrix with similarity threshold 1 was then used as the criterion for whether a protein sequence would remain in its homology group for the ISD analysis. We used ≥ 50% protein sequence similarity as the threshold to assign a link between a pair, and then used single-link clustering to assign protein sequences to 561 distinct homology groups. Pre-overlapping genes were then assigned to the homology groups of the corresponding ancestral genes.

E. ISD Prediction

We used IUPred [12] to calculate ISD values for each sequence. Following [52] , before running IUPred, we excised all cysteines from each amino acid sequence, because of the uncertainty about their disulphide bond status and hence entropy [49] . Whether cysteine forms a disulphide bond depends on whether it is in an oxidizing or reducing environment. IUPred implicitly, through the selection of its training data set, assumes most cysteines are in disulphide bonds, which may or may not be accurate for our set of viral proteins. Because cysteines have large effects on ISD (in either direction) depending on disulphide status and hence introduce large inaccuracies, cysteines were dropped from consideration altogether.IUPred assigns a score between 0 and 1 to each amino acid. To calculate the ISD of an overlapping region, IUPred was run on the complete protein (minus its cysteines), then the average score was taken across only the pertinent subset of amino acids.

F. Statistical Models

Prior to fitting linear models, sequence-level ISD values were transformed using a Box-Cox transform. The optimal value of λ for the combined ancestral, novel and artificially-frameshifted non-overlapping, non-ORF control group data was 0.41, which we rounded to 0.4 and used throughout all linear models, and for central tendency and confidence intervals in the figures. Simple means and standard errors are described in-line in the text.We used a multiple regression approach to determine which factors predict ISD values [44] . Gene whose ages could be classified, from non-overlapping genes in the species in which those 47 overlapping gene pairs were found, and from the 27 available pre-overlapping ancestral homologs. Some numbers in the main text are for the full set of 92 overlapping gene pairs and might not match exactly. (B) While frame significantly impacts disorder content (green is consistently higher than blue), it does not drive the high ISD of overlapping genes. Even controlling for frame, novel ISD > ancestral (left), supporting birth facilitation. Supporting conflict resolution, ancestral > non-overlapping either in-frame (yellow) or matched frameshifted control. The preadaptation version of the constraint hypothesis is supported by the fact that non-overlapping ISD < pre-overlapping (compare the two yellow bars). Means and 66% confidence intervals were calculated from the Box-Cox transformed (with λ = 0.4) means and their standard errors, and are shown here following back-transformation. designation (ancestral vs. novel vs. one or more nongenic controls) and relative reading frame (+1 vs. +2) were used as fixed effects. Homologous sequences are not independent; we accounted for this by using a linear mixed model [34] , with homology group as a random effect. Species is a stand-in for a number of confounding factors, e.g. %GC content, and so was included as a second random effect. The data were normalized using a Box-Cox transformation prior to analysis. Pairwise comparisons discussed throughout the Results were performed using contrast statements applied to the linear model, using the minimum number of gene designations necessary to make the comparison in question.We used the lmer and gls functions contained in the nlme and lme4 R packages to generate the linear mixed models. The main model used to calculate the relative effect sizes used frameshifted non-ORF nonoverlapping genes as the non-genic control. In this model, frame, gene designation, species, and homology group terms were retained in the model with p = 5×10 −20 , 1×10 −6 , 9×10 −19 , and 2×10 −3 respectively. All four terms were also easily retained in all other model variants exploring different non-genic controls.We also considered overlap type (internal vs. terminal) as a fixed effect, but removed it because it did not significantly enhance our model (p = 0.86). To determine the statistical significance of each effect, we used the anova function in R to compare nested models.

G. Data Availability

Scripts and data tables used in this work may be accessed at: https://github.com/ MaselLab/Willis_Masel_Overlapping_ Genes_Structural_Disorder_Explained

A. Confirming elevated ISD in our dataset

Because most verified gene overlaps in the literature, especially longer overlapping sequences, are in viruses [30] , [36] , [50] , we focused on viral genomes, compiling a list of 92 verified overlapping gene pairs from 80 viral species. The mean predicted ISD of all overlapping regions (0.39 ± 0.02) was higher than that of the non-overlapping genes (0.25 ± 0.01), confirming previous findings that overlapping genes have elevated ISD.

B. Frame affects ISD

We artificially frameshifted 150 non-overlapping viral genes in those 80 species, and found higher ISD in the +2 reading frame (0.35 ± 0.02) than in the +1 reading frame (0.19 ± 0.01) for non-ORF controls, and an even more extreme difference for ORF controls (0.47 ± 0.02 vs. 0.18 ± 0.01). The artifact hypothesis predicts that the +1 and +2 members of the 92 verified overlapping gene pairs will follow suit. In agreement with this, the overlapping regions of genes in the +2 reading frame had higher mean ISD (0.48 ± 0.03) than those in the +1 reading frame (0.31 ± 0.02). While this provides strong evidence that frame shapes ISD as an artifact of the genetic code, average ISD across both ways of frameshifting nonoverlapping genes (0.27±0.01 and 0.22±0.02 for non-ORF and ORF frameshifted non-overlapping genes, respectively) is significantly lower than the ISD of all overlapping sequences (0.39 ± 0.02), showing that the artifact hypothesis cannot fully explain elevated ISD in the latter.

The Birth-Facilitation Hypothesis is Supported

We find stronger support for the birth-facilitation hypothesis. Of the 92 verified overlapping viral gene pairs, we were able to classify the relative ages of the component genes as ancestral vs. novel for 47 pairs (Table I ). In agreement with the predictions of the birthfacilitation process, and controlling for frame, novel genes have higher ISD than either ancestral members of the same gene pairs or artificially-frameshifted controls ( Figure 4B ). We confirmed this using a linear mixed model, with frame (+1 vs. +2) as a fixed effect, gene type (novel vs. ancestral) as a fixed effect, species (to control for %GC content and other subtle sequence biases) as a random effect, and homology group (to control for phylogenetic confounding) as a random effect. Within this linear model, the prediction unique to the birth-facilitation hypothesis, namely that ISD in the overlapping regions of novel genes is higher than that in ancestral genes, is supported with p = 0.03. Inspection of Figure 4B suggests that elevation of novel gene ISD above ancestral is specific to the +2 frame; this is confirmed in the analysis of Figure 5B . Running separate statistical models for the two frames, the +2 frame difference is supported with p = 0.006.These non-ORF frameshifted control sequences do not take into account the fact that ORFs vary in their propensity to appear and disappear, and that this can shape the material available for de novo gene birth, including ISD values [33] . However, we did not observe this affecting ISD in our data set. In a linear model comparing ORF vs non-ORF non-overlapping control sequences, and one comparing ORF vs. non-ORF pre-overlapping controls sequences, there was no significant difference between the two controls (p = 0.7 in both cases, with frame included as a fixed effect, and gene as a random effect). This justifies a focus on the larger non-ORF control dataset, as well as excluding this non-adaptive force as a driver of the birth facilitation hypothesis.

The Preadaptation Version of the Conflict-Resolution Hypothesis is Supported

In agreement with the conflict resolution hypothesis, ancestral overlapping sequences, not just novel ones, have higher ISD than non-overlapping genes (0.35 ± 0.02 vs. 0.25 ± 0.01 ; p = 2 × 10 −5 ). This seems to be because ISD was already high at the time of de novo gene birth; today's ancestral overlapping genes have indistiguishable ISD from their pre-overlapping homologs (p = 0.6), while those pre-overlapping homologs have higher ISD than non-overlapping genes (p= 2 × 10 −3 ) ( Figure 4B ).It is possible that the overlapping gene pairs for which we are able to identify pre-overlapping homologs are significantly younger than other overlapping gene pairs, and that there might therefore simply not have been enough time for the ancestral members of the pair to evolve higher ISD. Contradicting this, these 27 ancestral overlapping genes have indistinguishable ISD from the other 20 ancestral overlapping gene (p= 0.2, controlling for frame and homology group).

The Artifact Hypothesis is Rejected

Non-overlapping gene ISD is not statistically different from the mean of the +1 and +2 artificiallyframeshifted control versions of the same nonoverlapping nucleotide sequences (p = 0.88; contrast statement applied to a linear model with fixed effect of actual non-overlapping gene sequence vs. +1 artificially-frameshifted version vs +2 artificiallyframeshifted version, and gene identity as a random effect). In other words, despite the enormous effect of +1 vs. +2 reading frame, we find no support for the artifact hypothesis in explaining the elevated ISD of overlapping regions. In each overlapping gene pair, there is always exactly one gene in each of the two reading frames, such that the large effects of each of the two frames cancel each other out when all overlapping genes are considered together. It is nevertheless important to control for the large effect of frame while testing and quantifying other hypotheses.

The Relative Magnitude of Each Hypothesis

We calculated the degree to which birth facilitation elevates ISD using a contrast statement, as half the The ISD of a non-overlapping gene predicts the ISD of the non-ORF frameshifted version of that sequence. Model I regression lines are statistically indistiguishable in our set of 150 nonoverlapping viral genes vs. our set of 27 preoverlapping genes, which are therefore pooled (R 2 = 0.30 and R 2 = 0.24 for the +1 and +2 groups, respectively). (B) The overlapping ISD of the 47 gene pairs with classifiable relative ages. Each datapoint represents one overlapping pair. The regression lines from (A) are superimposed to illustrate the elevation of novel gene ISD born into the already intrinsically high-ISD +2 frame, which destroys the correlation (R 2 = 6.6 × 10 −5 for +2 in contrast to 0.26 for +1). difference between novel and ancestral genes, because exactly half of the genes are novel, and hence elevated above the ""normal"" ISD level of ancestral genes. By this calculation, birth facilitation accounts for 32% ± 13% of the estimated total difference in ISD between overlapping and non-overlapping genes.Note that frameshifted versions of high-ISD proteins have higher ISD than frameshifted versions of low-ISD proteins ( Figure 5A ). The two members of an overlapping pair share the same %GC content, and random sequences with higher %GC have substantially higher ISD [1] , so this could be responsible for the trait correlation. A facilitate-birth bias toward high ISD in newborn genes might do so in part via high %GC in the overlapping region at the time of birth, causing overlapping sequences to be biased not just toward high-ISD novel genes, but also toward high-ISD ancestral genes. Our 32% estimate attributes all of the ISD elevation in ancestral overlapping genes to constraint, but given the trait correlation shown in Figure 5A , some of this might also be due to birth facilitation, making 32% an underestimate. Note that novel genes born into the +2 frame have high ISD above and beyond the intrinsic correlation ( Figure 5B ), and are thus responsible for the statistical difference between ancestral vs. novel when frame is controlled for ( Figure 4B ).

C. Mutation Bias is Responsible for More Births in the Low-ISD +1 Frame

Given the strong influence of frame combined with support for the facilitate-birth hypothesis, we hypothesized that novel genes would be born more often into the +2 frame ( Figure 4A , green) because the intrinsically higher ISD of the +2 reading frame would facilitate high ISD in the novel gene and hence birth. Our dataset contained 41 phylogenetically independent overlapping pairs. Surprisingly, we found the opposite of our prediction: 31 of the novel genes were in the +1 frame of their ancestral counterparts, while only 10 were in the +2 frame (p = 10 −3 , cumulative binomial distribution with trial success probability 0.5).This unexpected result is stronger for ""internal overlaps"", in which one gene is completely contained within its overlapping partner (23 +1 events vs. 1 +2 event, p = 3×10 −6 ), and is not found for ""terminal overlaps"", in which the 5 end of the downstream gene overlaps with the 3 end of the upstream member of the pair (9 +1 events vs. 9 +2 events). (This double-counts a +1 event for which there were three homologous gene pairs, two of which were internal overlaps, and one of which was a terminal overlap.) Following [2] , . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/229690 doi: bioRxiv preprint we interpret the restriction of this finding to internal overlaps as evidence that the cause of the bias applies to complete de novo gene birth, but not to the addition of a sequence to an existing gene.The unexpected prevalence of +1 gene births, despite birth facilitation favoring +2, can be explained by mutation bias. One artifact of the genetic code is that +1 frameshifts yield more start codons and fewer stop codons, and hence fewer and shorter ORFs [2] . In our control set of 150 non-overlapping viral genes, we confirm that stop codons are more prevalent in the +2 frame (1 per 11 codons) than the +1 frame (1 per 14) , decreasing the mean ORF length, and that start codons are more prevalent in the +1 frame (1 per 27 codons) than the +2 frame (1 per 111). Similar results were found in the pre-overlapping ancestral homologs, with more start codons in the +1 frame (1 per 33) than the +2 frame (1 per 169), and fewer stop codons in the +1 frame (1 per 20) than the +2 frame (1 per 13). This is reflected in the relative numbers and sizes of our frameshifted ORF controls. Prior to implementing a minimum length requirement (see Materials and Methods), we found 465 ORFs in the +1 frame of our non-overlapping genes, with a mean and maximum length of 24 and 149 amino acids, respectively, while only 92 ORFs were found in the +2 frame with a mean and maximum length of 19 and 92 amino acids. The same pattern was found in the pre-overlapping ancestral homologs, with 65 ORFs found in the +1 frame with a mean and maximum length of 36 and 315 amino acids, vs. 13 ORFs in the +2 frame with a mean and maximum length of 36 and 173 amino acids.

IV. DISCUSSION

There is growing interest in the topic of de novo gene birth, but identifying de novo genes is plagued with high rates of both false positives and false negatives [24] , with phylostratigraphy tools being particularly controversial due to homology detection biases [28] . The overlapping viral genes that we study are unlikely either to be non-genes, and must have arisen via de novo gene birth, and so circumvent many of these difficulties. [8] have disputed that young genes have high ISD, in an analysis that was prone to false positives [52] ; our findings here provide an independent line of evidence, free from the danger of homology detection bias, that younger genes have higher ISD.The study of overlapping genes has of course its own statistical traps. In particular, the preponderance of novel genes in the +1 frame demonstrates the need to control for the strong effects of frame when testing hypotheses. Ancestral genes are more frequently in the high-ISD +2 frame, while the depressed ISD of the +1 frame lowers the ISD of the novel. As a result, when frame is not considered, ancestral and novel overlapping sequences encode very similar levels of disorder (0.41 ± 0.03 vs. 0.42 ± 0.04, respectively), making it easy to miss the evidence for the facilitatebirth hypothesis.More broadly, our results are consistent with a major role for mutational availability in shaping adaptive evolution. Rare adaptive changes happen at a rate given by the product of mutation and the probability of fixation, with the latter proportional to the selection coefficient [23] . This means that differences in the beneficial mutation rate a"
"Abstract

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, subexponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t µ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents µ = 2.1 ± 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.

","I. INTRODUCTION

The current outbreak of the new coronavirus in Mainland China (COVID-19, previously named 2019-nCoV) is closely monitored by governments, researchers, and the public alike [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The rapid increase of positively diagnosed cases in Mainland China and subsequent exportation and confirmation of cases in more than 20 countries worldwide raised concern on an international scale. The World Health Organization (WHO) therefore announced the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [4] .Confirmed cases in Mainland China increased from approx. 330 on Jan. 21st, 2020 to more than 17,000 on Feb. 2nd, 2020 in a matter of two weeks [8] . In Hubei Province, the epicenter of the COVID-2019 outbreak, confirmed cases rose from 270 to 11,000 in this period, in all other Chinese provinces the cumulated case count increased from 60 to 6,000 in the same period.An initial exponential growth of confirmed cases is generically expected for an uncontrolled outbreak and in most cases mitigated with a time delay by effective containment strategies and policies that reduce transmission and effective reproduction of the virus, commonly yielding a saturation in the cumulative case count and an exponential decay in the number of new infections. Although in Hubei the number of cases was observed to grow exponentially in early January [9] , the * bfmaier@physik.hu-berlin.de subsequent rise followed a sub-exponential, super-linear, algebraic scaling law t µ with an exponent µ = 2.3 (between Jan. 24th and Feb. 9th), cf. Fig. 1A . For the majority of the affected Chinese provinces of Mainland China, however, this type of algebraic rise occured from the beginning, lacking an initial exponential growth altogether. Surprisingly, the exponent µ does not vary substantially with a typical value of µ = 2.1 ± 0.3 for the confirmed case curves in other substantially affected provinces (confirmed case counts larger than 500 on Feb. 12th), despite geographical, socio-economical differences, differences in containment strategies, and heterogeneties that may have variable impacts on how the local epidemic unfolds, cf. Fig. 1B and C.The universality of the scaling relation t µ with similar exponents µ is evidence that this aspect of the dynamics is determined by fundamental principles that are at work and robust with respect to variation of other parameters that typically shape the temporal evolution of epidemic processes. Three questions immediately arise, (i) what may be the reason for this functional dependency, (ii) are provinces other than Hubei mostly driven by export cases from Hubei and therefore follow a similar functional form in case counts as suggested by preliminary studies [10] [11] [12] , or, alternatively, (iii) is the scaling law a consequence of endogeneous and basic epidemiological processes and a consequence of a balance between transmission events and containment factors.Here we propose a parsimonious epidemiological model that incorporates quarantine measures and containment policies. In addition to standard epidemiological parameters such Figure 1 . A: Confirmed case numbers in Hubei. The increase in cases follows a scaling law t µ with an exponent µ = 2.32 after a short initial exponential growth phase. On Feb 9th the case count starts deviating towards lower values. B: Aggregated confirmed cases in all other affected provinces except Hubei. C(t) follows a scaling law with exponent µ = 1.92 until Feb. 2nd when case counts deviate to lower values. The insets in A and B depict C(t) on a log-log scale. C: Confirmed cases as a function of time for the 8 most affected provinces in China. The curves follow a scaling law with exponents µ ≈ 2 with the exception of Chongqing Province (µ = 1.45) and Jiangxi Province (µ = 2.75).as transmission and recovery rate, the model introduces effective quarantine measures that act on both, symptomatic infected individuals as well as susceptible individuals. We show that depleting both ""ends"" of the transmission interactions that involve an infectious and a susceptible individual naturally yields a sub-exponential, algebraic increase in confirmed cases. This behavior is qualitatively different from the behavior expected in a scenario in which only infecteds are targets of containment strategies to reduce transmission. In this case one expects either a stable exponential growth at a lower rate or an exponential decay if mitigation is sufficiently effective.The model predicts the observed growth of case numbers exceptionally well for almost all affected provinces for epidemiological parameters estimated by preliminary studies [6, 7, 11, 13] . Furthermore, the model permits an indirect assessment of the peak time in the number of undetected infec-tious individuals (asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic cases) that preceeds the depletion of confirmed cases. This indicates that the number of unidentified infectious indviduals peaked in early February.

A. Case numbers in Hubei and other provinces

We rely on case number data provided by the Systems Science and Engineering group of Johns Hopkins University who currently give up to two updates per day on the number of laboratory-confirmed cases globally [8] . For the time period discussed in this paper, the group integrated and curated case data manually collected at four sources: the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02. 18.20024414 doi: medRxiv preprint Prevention (CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Chinese physician's platform DXY.cn, and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC). The published data comprises total confirmed cases, total deaths, and total recovered cases as a function of time for each affected location. In the following we will focus on the number of total confirmed cases C(t).In Hubei, we find that the initital increase in confirmed cases is followed by an algebraic scaling with time, i.e. C(t) ∝ t µ , with a scaling exponent µ ≈ 2.3 that persisted until Feb. 9th, see Fig. 1A . On Feb. 12th, the case definition was changed by Chinese authorities which labeled a large number of previously unconfirmed cases as confirmed, leading to a discontinuity in the curves. We will therefore only consider data prior to Feb. 12th, 6am UTC. Fig. 1B illustrates the cumulated case count in all affected provinces except Hubei province. In the period Jan. 21st until Feb. 2nd the curve follows an algebraic scaling law t µ with µ ≈ 1.9 lacking the initial exponential phase observed in Hubei province. Starting on Feb. 2nd, the observed case count starts deviating towards lower case counts. This poses the question whether the observed behavior is an averaging affect introduced by accumulating case counts across provinces. Interestingly, Fig. 1C provides evidence that this is not so. The confirmed case counts in the most affected provinces all exhibit a scaling law with exponents close to µ = 2. Among the most affected provinces only Chongqing Province exhibits a significantly lower exponent. Furthermore, all provincial case count curves start deviating from the algebraic curve around Feb. 2nd.

B. Implemented policies

The Chinese government put several mitigation policies in place to contain the spread of the epidemic. In particular, positively diagnosed cases were either quarantined or put under a form of self-quarantine at home [14] . Similarly, suspicious cases were confined in monitored house arrest, e.g. individuals who arrived from Hubei before all traffic from its capital Wuhan was effectively restricted [15, 16] . These measures aimed at the removal of infectious individuals from the transmission process.Additionally, measures were implemented that aimed at the protection of the susceptible population by the partial shutdown of public life. For instance, universities remained closed, many businesses closed down, and people were asked to remain in their homes for as much time as possible [14] [15] [16] . These actions that affect both, susceptibles and nonsymptomatic infectious individuals, not only protect susceptibles from acquiring the infection but also remove a substantial fraction of the entire pool of susceptibles from the transmission process and thus indirectly mitigate the proliferation of the virus in the population in much the same way that herd immunity is effective in the context of vaccine preventable diseases.

III. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODELING WITH QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION

On a very basic level, an outbreak as the one in Hubei is captured by SIR dynamics [17] . The population is devided into three compartments that differentiate the state of invididuals with respect to the contagion process: (I)nfected, (S)usceptible to infection, and (R)emoved (i.e. not taking part in the transmission process). The corresponding variables S, I, and R quantify the respective compartments' fraction of the total population such that S + I + R = 1. The temporal evolution of the number of cases is governed by two processes: The infection that describes the transmission from an infectious to a susceptible individual with basic reproduction number R 0 and the recovery of an infected after an infectious period of average length T I . The basic reproduction number R 0 captures the average number of secondary infections an infected will cause before he or she recovers or is effectively removed from the population.Initially, a small fraction of infecteds yields an exponential growth if the basic reproduction number is larger than unity. When the supply of susceptibles is depleted, the epidemic reaches a maximum and the infecteds decline. A simple reduction of contacts caused by isolation policies could be associated with a reduction in the effective reproduction number, which would, however, still yield an exponential growth in the fraction of infecteds as long as R 0 > 1, inconsistent with the observed scaling law t µ discussed above. To test the hypothesis that the observed growth behavior can be caused by isolation policies that apply to both, infected and susceptible individuals, by effective public shutdown policies, we extend the SIR model by two additional mechanisms one of which can be interpreted as a process of removing susceptibles from the transmission process. First, we assume that general public containment policies or individual behavioral changes in response to the epidemic effectively remove individuals from the interaction dynamics or significantly reduce their participation in the transmission dynamics. Secondly, we account for the removal of symptomatic infected individuals by quarantine procedures. The dynamics is governed by the system of ordinary differential equations:a generalization of the standard SIR model, henceforth referred to as the SIR-X model. The rate parameters α and β quantify the transmission rate and the recovery rate of the standard SIR model, respectively. Additionally, the impact of public containment is captured by the terms proportional to the containment rate κ 0 that is effective in both I and S populations. Infected individuals are removed at rate κ corresponding to quarantine measures that only affect symptomatic infecteds. The new compartment X quantifies symptomatic, quarantined infecteds. Here we assume that the fraction X(t) is proportional to the empirical confirmed and reported cases. The case κ 0 = 0 corresponds to a scenario in which the general population is unaffected by policies or does not commit .

The case κ = 0 corresponds to a scenario in which symptomatic infecteds are not isolated specifically. Note that infecteds are always removed from their compartment I at a higher rate than susceptibles as β + κ + κ 0 > κ 0 .In the basic SIR model that captures unconstrained, free spread of the disease, the basic reproduction number R 0 is related to transmission and recovery rate by R 0 ≡ R 0,free = α/β because β −1 = T I is the average time an infected individual remains infectious before recovery or removal. Here, the time period that an infected individual remains infectious is T I,eff = (β + κ 0 + κ) −1 such that the effective, or ""observed"" reproduction number R 0,eff = αT I,eff is smaller than R 0,free since both κ 0 > 0 and κ > 0.We introduce public containment leverage P = κ 0 κ 0 + κ that reflects how strong isolation measures affect the general public in comparison to quarantine measures imposed on symptomatic infecteds alone. We further defineas the quarantine probability, i.e. the probability that an infected is identified and quarantined either in specialized hospital wards or at home.The key mechanism at work in the model defined by Eqs. (1)-(3) is the exponentially fast depletion of susceptibles in addition to isolation of infecteds. This effect is sufficient to account for the observed scaling law in the number of confirmed cases for a plausible range of rate parameters as discussed below.

IV. RESULTS

We assume that a small number of infected individuals travelled from Hubei to each of the other affected provinces before traffic restrictions were effective but at a time when containment measures were just being implemented. Fig. 2 illustrates the degree to which the case count for Hubei province and the aggregated case count for all other provinces is captured by the SIR-X model as defined by Eqs. (1)-(3).We find that for a wide range of model parameters, the case count is well reproduced by the model. The model reproduces the scaling law t µ as observed in the data for a significant period of time before saturating to a finite level. Remarkably, the model is able to reproduce both growth behaviors observed in the data: The model predicts the expected initial growth of case numbers in Hubei Province followed by an algebraic growth episode for ≈ 11 days until the saturation sets in, a consequence of the decay of unidentified infected individuals after a peak time around Feb. 7th (see Fig. 2A) . Furthermore, the model also captures the immediate sub-exponential growth observed in the remaining most affected provinces (Fig. 2B-C) . Again, saturation is induced by a decay of unidentified infecteds after peaks that occur several days before peak time Province N/10 6 Q P I 0 /X 0 R 0,eff in Hubei, ranging from Jan. 31st to Feb. 5th. For all provinces, following their respective peaks the number of unidentified infecteds I(t) decays over a time period that is longer than the reported estimation of maximum incubation period of 14 days [7, 13] . It is important to note that due to the uncertainty in the population size, the numerical value of unidentified infecteds is sensitive to parameter variations-the general shape of I(t), however, is robust for a wide choice of parameters, as discussed in App. A. Parameter choices for best fits were a fixed basic reproduction number of R 0,free = 6.2 (note that this reproduction number corresponds to an unconstrained epidemic) and a fixed mean infection duration of T I = 8 d consistent with previous reports concerning the incubation period of COVID-19 [7, 13] . The remaining fit parameters are shown in Tab. I. For these values, the effective basic reproduction number is found to range between 1.7 ≤ R 0,eff ≤ 3.3 for the discussed provinces, consistent with estimates found in previous early assessment studies [6, 7, 18, 19] .A detailed analysis of the obtained values for quarantine probability Q and public containment leverage P indicates that a wide range of these parameters can account for similar shapes of the respective case counts. Consequently, the model is structurally stable with respect to these parameters and the numerical value is of less importance than the quality of the mechanism they control (see App. A).For the remaining 20 provinces, we find growth behaviors similar to the ones discussed before. Some follow a functional form comparable to the case counts in Hubei, others display a stronger agreement with pure algebraic growth, as can be seen in Fig. 3 . Generally, a stronger agreement with algebraic growth can be associated with stronger public containment leverages.In order to stress the general importance of public containment measures and to clarify to what extent quarantine is connected to case confirmation we also analyzed a model variant where (i) the general public and infecteds are removed from .

Note that the effective, observed basic reproduction number R 0,eff has lower values and varies for each of the affected provinces as discussed in Sec. IV and shown in Tab. I. A: In Hubei, the model captures both, the initial rise of confirmed cases as well as the subsequent algebraic growth. The confirmed cases are predicted to saturate at C = 51, 000. The model also predicts the time-course of the number of unidentified infectious individuals I(t) which peaks on Feb. 7th and declines exponentially afterwards. While the order of I(t) is associated with rather large fluctuations depending on the fitting procedure, the predicted peak time is robust, consistently around Feb. 7th. B: Model prediction for case numbers aggregated over all affected provinces other than Hubei. The case numbers' algebraic growth is well reflected and predicted to saturate at C = 12, 600. In contrast to Hubei, the fraction of unidentified infecteds peaks around Feb. 1st, approximately a week earlier. The insets in A and B depict both data and fits on a log-log scale. C: Fits for confirmed cases as a function of time for the remaining 8 most affected provinces in China. All curves are well captured by the model fits that predict similar values for the peak time of unidentified infecteds. the transmission process in the same way and (ii) case counting is decoupled from the quarantine process (see App. C). We find that these model variants describe the real case count data reasonably well for the majority of provinces, further evidence of the importance of containment policies that target the susceptible population. In App. B we present further analytical evidence for this conclusion.Note that the described saturation behavior of confirmed cases requires that eventually all susceptibles will effectively be removed from the transmission process. In reality, not every susceptible person can be isolated for such an extended period of time as the model suggests. One might expect instead that the number of infecteds will decay more slowly and saturate to a small, yet non-zero level. At this point it would be crucial to identify unquarantined infecteds more efficiently in order to completely shut down the transmission process. Due to potential difficulties in upholding the containment policies for such an extended period of time, we expect that our predictions will underestimate the final total amount of confirmed cases..

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In summary, we find that one of the key features of the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province but also in all other provinces is the robust sub-exponential rise in the number of confirmed cases according to the scaling law t µ during the first episode of the epidemic. This general, almost universal behavior is evidence that fundamental principles are at work associated with this particular epidemic that are dominated by the interplay of the contagion process with endogeneous behavioral changes in the susceptible population and external mitigation policies. We find that the generic scaling of case counts with time is independent of many other factors that often shape the time-course of an epidemic.The model defined by Eqs. (1)-(3) and discussed here indicates that this type of behavior can generally be expected if the supply of susceptible individuals is systematically decreased by means of implemented containment strategies or behavioral changes in response to information about the ongoing epidemic. Unlike contagion processes that develop without external interference at all or processes that merely lead to parametric changes in the dynamics, our analysis suggests that non-exponential growth is expected when the supply of susceptibles is depleted on a timescale comparable to the infectious period assiociated with the infection. The effective depletion of the susceptible populations on a timescale κ −1 0 in the model does not imply that the pool of susceptibles must be depleted in a physical sense. Rather, this depletion could be achieved indirectly.Containment that targets the susceptible population is a requirement for the observed algebraic scaling of case counts with time, unlike the reduction of transmission rates, or the reduction of the duration infected individuals remain infectious. Both of the latter measures address infected individuals only, which leads to a reduction of the exponential growth rate of new infections, or an exponential decay if the corresponding measures are sufficiently effective, but do not alter the functional growth behavior.The fact that scaling laws were observed in Hubei after an initial exponential phase and that an exponential phase was not observed in the other substantially affected provinces is consistent with the model predictions if one assumes that the response in the population and the effect of policies lagged the onset of the epidemic in Hubei province and was immediate in all other provinces that were in an alert status already when cases were increasing substantially in Hubei province.The model reproduces the empirical case counts in all provinces well for plausible parameter values. The quality of the reproduction of the case counts in all 29 affected provinces can be used to estimate the peak time of the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic infected individuals in the population, which is the key quantity for estimating the time when this outbreak will wane. The current analysis indicates that this peak time was reached around Feb. 7th for Hubei and within the first days of February in the remaining affected provinces.The model further suggests that the public response to the epidemic and the containment measures put in place by the Chinese administration were effective despite the increase in confirmed cases. That this behavior was universally observed in all provinces also indicates that mitigation strategies were universally effective. Based on our analysis, we argue that the implemented containment strategies should stay in effect for a longer time than the incubation period after the saturation in confirmed cases sets in for this particular outbreak.Our analysis further implies and provides evidence that mitigation strategies that target the susceptible population and induce behavioral changes at this ""end"" of the transmission process are most effective to contain an epidemic-especially in situations when asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infectious periods are long or their duration unknown. This may be of importance for developing containment strategies in future scenarios or if the current COVID-19 epidemic were to trigger large scale outbreaks in other regions of the world by exports and subsequent proliferation. Fits were performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt method of least squares. We fixed the epidemiological parameters to duration of infection T I = 8 d and basic reproduction number R 0,free = αT I = 6.2. The population size N of each of the affected Chinese provinces was obtained from the Geonames project [20] and is listed in Tab. I. For each confirmed cases data set, we set the initial conditions X(t 0 ) = C(t 0 )/N,is the i-th pair of a province's time and aggregated confirmed case number. Since the number of unidentified infectious is unknown per definition, the prefactor I 0 /X 0 ≥ 1 was chosen as a fit parameter. The remaining fit parameters were quarantine rate κ > 0 and containment rate κ 0 > 0. For the fit procedure, Eqs. (1)-(3) were integrated using the Dormand-Prince method which implements a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with step-size control, yielding I(t) and X(t) for every parameter configuration and every data set. The residuals were computed asWe find that the model accurately reflects both the subexponential growth as well as the saturating behavior observed in the data discussed in the main text, with the obtained fit parameters displayed in Tab. I. For the 9 majorly affected provinces and the aggregated data over all provinces except Hubei, the quarantine probability is found to have similar values of Q = 0.6 ± 0.1. The public containment leverage is fluctuating more strongly with values ranging between P = 0.07 and P = 1, where generally, lower values appear concurrently with a higher quarantine probability, which suggests that stronger quarantine implementation requires less public .

Yet, we advise not to overinterpret the values of these fit parameters, as many different parameter values generate similar developments of confirmed cases.As we fixed the population size to be equal to the total population of the respective provinces, one might also ask how system size changes the results-for instance, if the outbreak is contained in a small region of a province, the effective population available to the transmission process will be substantially smaller. Therefore, we repeated the fit procedure with N as a free fit parameter to find that the form of X(t) is not altered substantially for different values of N, while I(t) can vary more strongly as reflected by a larger variation in I 0 . This result suggests that the estimation of the number of infecteds is associated with a larger uncertainty. The general shape of I(t), however, remains stable such that an inference of the peak time of unidentified infecteds is reasonable. Furthermore, the model favours larger values of the containment rate κ 0 for larger population sizes in order to reproduce emprical data. This is a reasonable because the number of available transmission pathways grows quadratically with the population size, making it easier for the disease to spread faster. In order to still observe sub-exponential growth, a large part of the susceptible population has to be removed quickly. Consistently, we find that a decay of susceptibles is necessary to reliably obtain the observed growth behavior (i.e. P > 0, κ 0 > 0).Concerning variation in the fixed model parameters, larger values of up to R 0,free = 12 yield results similar to the ones described above when adjusting the infectious period T I to larger values, as well. For lower values of R 0,free < 6, the model fails to reproduce the scaling laws observed in the data. Similarly, the fit results are reasonably robust against variations of the duration of infection in a range of T I ∈ [6 d, 20 d] with concurrent adjustment of R 0,free . Similar effects are found for the remaining 20 affected provinces for which model fits are displayed in Fig. 3 with parameters given in Tab. II. In general, provinces with larger values of public containment leverage P exhibit a stronger agreement with the hypothesis of algebraic growth.All data and the analysis material is available online [21] .Appendix B: Case-number development in early phase of the epidemic In a typical outbreak scenario only few people are infected initially, such that S(0) = 1 − ε and I(0) = with ε 1, which implies that the depletion of susceptibles available to the transmission process will be dominated by shutdown policies. This assumption effectively linearizes Eq. (1), yielding the solutionFurther integration of the linearized Eq. (2) yields Table II . Fit parameters as described in Sec. III, fixed population size N, and resulting effective basic reproduction number R 0,eff for the remaining affected provinces, decreasingly ordered by largest case number. The infectious period T I and the basic reproduction number R 0,free = αT I were fixed to values T I = 8 d and R 0,free = 6.2, respectively.For small values of t we can expand the exponent to obtain the approximate growth functionHere, the first factor implies that quarantining infecteds merely decreases the rate with which their number will grow exponentially, while the second term suppresses the whole transmission process well enough to alter the growth behavior. This implies that public shutdown policies facilitate epidemic containment in a more effective way than quarantine measures.

Appendix C: Case confirmation without quarantine

In an alternative approach to the one discussed in the main text one may assume that isolation affects all citizens equally, i.e. κ = 0, but that the confirmation and counting of a new case is decoupled from whether the respective person is quarantined or not-rather, an infected is discovered and counted .

"Abstract

Delivery of native or chemically modified recombinant proteins into mammalian cells shows 31 promise for functional investigations and various technological applications, but concerns 32 that sub-cellular localization and functional integrity of delivered proteins may be affected 33 remain high. Here, we surveyed batch electroporation as a delivery tool for single 34 polypeptides and multi-subunit protein assemblies of kinetochores, a spatially confined and 35 well-studied subcellular structures. After electroporation in human cells, recombinant 36 fluorescent Ndc80 and Mis12 multi-subunit complexes displayed native localization, 37 physically interacted with endogenous binding partners, and functionally complemented 38 depleted endogenous counterparts to promote mitotic checkpoint signaling and 39 chromosome segregation. Farnesylation is required for kinetochore localization of the 40 Dynein adaptor Spindly. In cells with chronically inhibited farnesyl transferase activity, in 41 vitro farnesylation and electroporation reconstituted robust kinetochore localization of 42Spindly. Thus, electroporation is uniquely versatile for delivering synthetic and, as required, 43 chemically modified functional mimics of endogenous proteins, and is therefore a promising 44 tool for chemical and synthetic biology.

","Introduction

can reach very high concentrations, we observed linear uptake characteristics over a broad 140 range of input protein concentrations in the EP slurry ( Figure S1A-B) , indicating that EP 141 allows for semi-quantitative delivery of recombinant proteins. In turn, this allows for the 142 generation of cell populations harboring defined amounts of exogenously delivered proteins 143 ( Figure S1C-D) . Importantly, EP is efficient across multiple cell lines and treated cells show 144 little or no sign of damage or toxicity ( Figure S1A and D-F). 145Previously, we generated various recombinant versions of stable sub-complexes of the 146 human kinetochore, and demonstrated that they could be used to reconstitute large parts of 147 the kinetochore and of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) in vitro (1, 28, 31, 32) . This 148 library of high-quality recombinant samples ( Figure S2 ) already extensively characterized in 149 vitro represented an excellent resource to address the general suitability of EP for in vivo 150 delivery and functional analysis. 151We initially tested this approach on BUBR1 (BUB1-related), a multi-domain protein that 152 operates in the SAC. Recombinant BUBR1 1-571 (encompassing residues 1-571 of the 1050-153 residue BubR1 protein, which are sufficient for checkpoint function) (1) fused to a cyan 154 fluorescent protein (CFP) was introduced into HeLa cells at an EP slurry concentration of 155 10 . In mitotically arrested cells (by addition of the spindle poison nocodazole, a 156 condition that activates the SAC), CFP-BUBR1 1-571 distinctly localized to kinetochores, as 157 revealed by the typical punctuate staining and by co-localization with CREST, an established 158 kinetochore marker ( Figure 1C) . We have shown previously that BUBR1 kinetochore 159 recruitment in human cells requires dimerization with kinetochore-bound BUB1, a BUBR1 160 paralog, through segments that encompass a predicted helical domain in the two proteins 161 (33). In agreement with these previous observations, recombinant CFP-BUBR1 1-571-∆Helix , a 162 deletion mutant of BUBR1 lacking the BUB1 binding helix (deletion of residues 432-484) 163 was unable to localize to kinetochores (Figure 1D-F) . Collectively, these results demonstrate 164 that, following EP, recombinant CFP-BUBR1 1-571 binds to its endogenous kinetochore 165 receptor BUB1 in target cells. The efficiency of CFP-BUBR1 1-571 delivery was high and most 166 cells displayed uniform levels of the recombinant protein ( Figure S3) . Thus, electroporation 167 can deliver very similar amounts of recombinant protein into each cell. In the course of this 168 study, this became to be recognized as a general feature of this approach, largely 169 independently of the protein used. 170We used the Sortase method (34) to fuse a fluorescent peptide modified with the dye tetra-171 methyl-rhodamine (TAMRA) to the C-terminus of MAD2, another SAC protein. The 172 resulting MAD2 TAMRA was delivered by EP in HeLa cells at an EP-slurry concentration of 5 173 . Like CFP-BUBR1 1-571 , MAD2 TAMRA was found to localize effectively at kinetochores of 174 nocodazole-treated cells, as shown by co-localization with CREST ( Figure 1G) . 175Furthermore, we performed co-delivery of CFP-BUBR1 1-571 with MAD2 TAMRA , and found 176 both proteins at unattached KTs in nocodazole-arrested cells ( Figure 1H) . Thus, individual 177 or multiple fluorophore-tagged components of the human KT are faithfully targeted to their 178 respective binding sites after EP. 179In addition to localization studies, we tested if EP can be used in combination with in-cell 180 spectroscopic applications, such as FLIM-FRET microscopy (35), to study the 181 spatiotemporal dynamics of recombinant proteins in vivo. KRAS/p21 is a small, globular 182GTPase with important regulatory functions in many signaling pathways (36). We studied 183 found that EGFP-TF3-KRAS, but not EGFP, predominantly localize to the plasma 191 membrane (Figure S4B) , with a pattern indistinguishable from endogenous, over-expressed, 192 or microinjected . Following addition of EGF, we observed the predicted 193 increase in the donor lifetime of EGFP-TF3-KRAS (Figure S4C-D) . Importantly, our based results were qualitatively and quantitatively identical to the ones that were observed in 195 EGFP-TF3-KRAS microinjection experiments (37), demonstrating the suitability of EP for 196

The experiments discussed in the previous section described delivery of single polypeptides. 201Next, we tested the suitability of EP for delivery of multi-subunit protein complexes. To this 202 end, we started with the Mis12 complex (MIS12C, where 'C' stands for 'complex'), an 203 extremely stable four-subunit kinetochore assembly of the DSN1, NSL1, MIS12, and PMF1 204 subunits with molecular mass of 120 kDa. In previous studies, we demonstrated that the 205 stability of the MIS12C requires co-expression of all four constituent subunits and reported 206 the development of various co-expression vectors for its heterologous reconstitution in 207 insect cells (39-41). Here we generated a fluorescence version of MIS12C by fusing the 208 coding sequence of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) to that of the PMF1 subunit. We then 209 co-expressed the subunits in insect cells and purified the resulting complex (CFP-MIS12C) 210to homogeneity ( Figure S2) . 211We electroporated CFP-MIS12C into cycling HeLa cells and monitored CFP-MIS12C levels 212 by fluorescent microscopy. At an EP slurry concentration of 8  CFP-MIS12C was 213 clearly visible at kinetochores in the large majority of electroporated cells and with 214 remarkably similar kinetochore levels within the same cell and between different cells 215 ( Figure 2B and Figure S3C ). The ability of the electroporated CFP-MIS12C to reach 216 kinetochores after introduction in the cellular environment indicates that the complex retains 217 its integrity through the electroporation process. 218In a more stringent test, we also asked if CFP-MIS12C retained its expected kinetochore 219 function after electroporation. MIS12C is as an assembly hub for the kinetochore, being 220 responsible for the recruitment of a subset of the microtubule-binding NDC80 complexes as 221 well as of KNL1, a signaling platform for the SAC (41, 42) ( Figure 1A) . These functions 222 make MIS12C necessary for timely chromosome congression and faithful cell division. To 223 test the functionality of the recombinant CFP-MIS12 complex, we performed a 224 complementation assay in HeLa cells depleted of endogenous MIS12 complex by the RNA 225 interference (RNAi) methods using silencing RNAs (siRNAs) against multiple subunits, as 226 previously described (43). Effective depletion of MIS12C subunits and uptake of fluorescent 227 proteins was demonstrated by Western blotting (Figure 2A) . This is noteworthy, as it 228 exposes a fundamental advantage of EP over another protein targeting technique such as 229 .

In agreement with previous reports, depletion of MIS12C 231 compromised chromosome congression ( Figure 2B-C) , a consequence of reduced 232 kinetochore levels of NDC80 and KNL1 (43). As shown by live-cell microscopy, EP 233 delivery of CFP-MIS12C into depleted cells, but not of a CFP control, rescued chromosome 234 congression essentially to the levels observed in control cells, indicating that the recombinant 235 complex is functionally active (Figure 2B- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We were curious to 262 assess if extreme elongation of NDC80C affected EP efficiency. As for the MIS12C, also the 263 ~180 kDa NDC80C achieves stability through co-expression of its four subunits (NUF2, 264 SPC24, SPC25, and NDC80) in insect cells ((40, 45) ; Figure 1A The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

A previously described 293 NDC80 mutant (9A) carrying nine alanine mutations at the phosphorylation sites in the 294 protein's N-terminus establishes hyper-stable KT-MT attachments that cannot be corrected, 295 resulting in frequent chromosome congression errors (47) (48) (49) . We asked if a NDC80C 9A -296 GFP mutant electroporated in HeLa cells had dominant-negative effects in an established 297 biorientation and error correction assay (50). HeLa cells were allowed to enter mitosis in 298 presence of STLC, an inhibitor of the Eg5 kinesin (51) whose activity is crucially required for 299 centrosome separation and spindle bipolarization, resulting in the accumulation of 300 monopolar spindles in which sister kinetochores frequently attach to the same microtubule 301 organizing center (MTOC, the centrosome in this case) in a condition known as synthelic 302 attachment. Upon washout of STLC, Eg5 reactivation, and spindle bipolarization, a 303 functional error correction pathway is required to resolve the synthelic attachments and 304 achieve correct metaphase alignment (50). In this setup, control cells electroporated with 305 GFP or NDC80C WT -GFP corrected erroneous attachments and aligned their chromosomes 306properly at the metaphase plate ( Figure 3E ). In contrast, cells electroporated with the 307 NDC80C 9A -GFP mutant were impaired in their correction pathway, and accumulated 308 Spindly is an adaptor protein that promotes the interaction of the minus-end-directed motor 315Dynein with its processivity factor Dynactin (52, 53). Spindly also interacts directly with the 316 ROD-Zwilch-ZW10 (RZZ) complex, the main constituent of the so-called kinetochore 317 corona, a crescent-shaped structure that assembles on kinetochores in early prometaphase to 318 promote microtubule capture (54) (Figure 1A) . Kinetochore localization of Spindly critically 319 depends on its ability to interact with the RZZ complex (55, 56). The latter, in turn, requires 320 the irreversible post-translational isoprenylation of Spindly with a farnesyl moiety on cysteine 321 .

Two versions 329 of HsSpindly that were N-terminally fused to GFP or mCherry (molecular mass ~95 kDa) 330were expressed in insect cells and purified to homogeneity ( Figure S2 ). Our previous mass 331 spectrometry analysis demonstrated that only trace farnesylation of Spindly takes place in 332 insect cells (57). When we EP-delivered fluorescent recombinant mCherry-Spindly into 333HeLa cells, we detected a fluorescent signal at the periphery of kinetochores that was 334 comparable to the localization described for endogenous Spindly (Figure 4A The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

For instance, 358 genetic code expansion, an approach that allows to introduce old and new chemical 359 functionalities into proteins, from synthetic, photostable fluorescent dyes with high quantum 360 yields to highly reactive activatable groups (e.g. UV-activated cross-linkers and click 361 chemistry tools), is undergoing an explosive development (3, 59). With rapid growth of 362 chemical and synthetic biology, the demand for robust methods to deliver modified 363 synthetic or semi-synthetic macromolecules into cells is growing (60). 364While electroporation has been long recognized for its potential as a delivery approach, 365 questions have been raised regarding the degree of its invasiveness and damage inferred on 366 cellular structures, most notably membranes (61). Here, we have assessed the suitability of 367 batch EP for delivering recombinant proteins into living mammalian cells for various 368 applications in cell biology. In comparison to previous studies that focused on cytosolic 369 proteins devoid of specific localization, our focus was on kinetochores, which are small, 370 discrete subcellular structures. This was crucial, because it enabled a detailed assessment of 371 the effective degree of functional complementation of the electroporated samples. Our 372 results identify EP as a rapid, efficient, and semi-quantitative technique that enables the 373 delivery into various cultured mammalian cell lines of proteins of variable mass and 374 hydrodynamic radius, including the highly elongated NDC80C. Importantly, we provide 375 clear evidence that the delivered proteins remain structurally and functionally intact after 376 delivery, as witnessed by their correct kinetochore localization and, where applicable, ability 377 to complement RNAi-based depletion, dominant negative effects, and immunoprecipitation 378 with endogenous interacting partners. Thus, in addition to its ease of application, EP is very 379 attractive because it allows delivery in sufficiently large cohorts of cells, and is therefore 380 compatible with cell biochemistry, as clearly shown here. 381 .

Following EP, the slurry was added to 50 ml of pre-412 warmed PBS, sedimented by a 0.5xg centrifugation and trypsinised for 5 to 7 minutes to 413 remove non-internalized extracellular protein. Following one further wash in PBS and 414 centrifugation, the cell pellet was re-suspended in complete imaging medium (without 415 antibiotics) and transferred to a cell-imaging plate (Ibidi). Cells were returned to the 416 incubator and allowed to recover for a minimum of 5 hrs. After recovery, cells were either 417 analyzed by fluorescence microscopy imaging or processed to generate protein extracts to be 418 used for either immunoprecipitation analysis or western blotting. 419 EP with the Amaxa system was performed according to the reported protocol (21). EP 420 conditions described above gave satisfactory results for all the cell types and proteins tested. 421Only a small fraction of the tested recombinant proteins proved unsuitable for EP delivery. 422This was due to formation of major intracellular aggregates or because the protein samples 423 failed to localize correctly within the cell. We advise to initially vary EP parameters, most 424 notably pulse strength and duration, for optimal performance. Moreover, cell-specific and 425protein-specific optimization of such parameter should be always carried out in order to 426 achieve the best trade-off between cell viability and efficient protein delivery. The following 427 are some of the important factor to consider during optimization of protein delivery: 1) In 428 our work, we invariably used protein samples of great purity and homogeneity (high 429 monodispersity and solubility). Although we did not systematically analyze the relationship 430 between protein homogeneity and efficiency of EP, we suspect that protein sample quality is 431 an important factor. 2) Centrifugation of protein sample prior to EP is strongly 432 Actin IgM (Merck Millipore, JLA20, 1:5,000 dilution).

"Abstract

In 2013, U.S. swine producers were confronted with the disruptive emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread.together produce 95 percent of the U.S. pig crop. 5 Farms experiencing outbreaks have suffered 90 percent and higher losses of .

","Introduction

The 2013 emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) 1 in the United States has provided an example of both the economic hardships livestock diseases can cause and our limited understanding of how such diseases spread. Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), the causative agent, acutely infects the intestine and causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting. 2 Currently, the earliest known U.S. outbreak occurred in April, 3 and in less than a year PED outbreaks were confirmed in 27 states, 4 states that unweaned pigs. 3 The time it takes for a farm to return to stable production is highly variable but on the order of weeks, leading to great expenses in infection control costs and production losses alike.Losses were also apparent on a national economic scale. Producers had for the previous 8 years been making steady increases in the average litter size of about 0.16 head per year. 6 By November 2013, the average litter size had begun an abnormal downturn, 6 dropping 0.66 head by March 2014. 7 The virus also affected swine production in Asia and other parts of America. 8, 9 The mechanisms by which PEDV spread among farms are not yet clear. Transportation-associated transmission of PEDV has been supported by the observation at harvest facilities that it spreads among trailers used to transport swine, 10 and some experts believe that current resources of livestock trailers, trailer-washing facilities, and transport personnel are insufficient to allow for a standard 3-hour trailer cleaning between every load. 11 With such concerns in mind, some states responded to PED by requiring that imported swine be from PEDV-free premises. Transportation-independent mechanisms such as airborne particles 12 and contaminated feed [13] [14] [15] [16] have also been implicated. Detailed investigations of outbreaks on farms can be inconclusive regarding the mechanism of PEDV introduction. 3 Much of the research on PED involves detailed investigations on a small scale. For example, there have been epidemiological investigations of infected farms in North Carolina and a cluster of infected farms in Oklahoma and adjacent states. 17 Such work is effective for determining the biological plausibility of different routes, but the risk factors identified in a small-scale study may be specific to the small area of the study. Modelling studies based on large-scale surveillance data [18] [19] [20] can thus be a valuable complement to such work by quantifying the overall importance of a transmission route across a large population.Such quantification for PED could also be considered a contribution to the general study of infectious diseases of livestock.Although animal movements in general are considered a risk for transmission, 21 only a limited number of studies 18-20, 22, 23 have quantitatively compared this risk to other competing risks. One likely reason for this scarcity is that statistical analysis of the available data often presents many challenges such as incomplete and noisy reporting as well as correlations in explanatory variables.Here we first evaluate the sensitivity of a correlation analysis to transmission and contact parameters of a simulation model of PED spread among U.S. swine farms via spatial and transport-associated pathways. The model includes an error-prone observational component designed to mimic that of the real data. We then apply this correlation analyis to the real data. We follow up on this analyis by considering a larger group of explanatory variables and applying stability selection to identify those with the most robust association with PED burdens. Using the selected variables, we formulate a simple model of farm-to-farm spread and estimate transmission parameters.

Natural history of PED outbreaks

We first provide a brief background on the natural history PED outbreaks to make clear the features that our models replicate and those that they do not. The time from the introduction of infected animals to the appearance of clinical symptoms in PEDV-naive herds is typically less than 7 days. 9, 24 PED may spread rapidly within farms following the first appearance of clinical signs . 9, 16, [25] [26] [27] The spread may also be actively promoted as a part of recommended feedback procedures to establish herd immunity. 24 The duration of an outbreak can vary substantially. The lower bound would be roughly a week, as virus shedding from individuals has been observed in experimental settings to subside within 9 days of infection, 28 and an infected animal's diarrhoea has been observed in the field to typically last for 5 days. 25 However, it can take affected farms several weeks to return to baseline production levels. 9, 25 In summary, within a farm spread is often rapid and complete enough that assuming all animals on the farm to have the same status is justified when observation occurs at weekly intervals.

Structure of the U.S. swine herd

When we step back from a single farm and consider all the farms in the United States, a number of heterogeneities enter the picture. All of the contiguous 48 states share some portion of the nation's swine but the Midwest and North Carolina are areas of major concentration ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), holding some 88 percent of the inventory. 5 Thus considerable climactic and density gradients exist. Live swine are moved among farms for feeding and breeding purposes. We refer to aggregated measurements of these movements as transport flows. The value of these flows varies greatly between different pairs of states with the largest flows being into the Midwest (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). These heterogeneities may result in the spread of a disease resulting in a spatio-temporal distribution of outbreaks that is dependent on the mode of farm-to-farm spread, and for PED data on both the spatio-temporal pattern and the heterogeneities are available at the state level.

Data sources

The data we analysed were obtained from public sources. The data on numbers of farms, balance sheets, and climatic regions came from regular USDA reports. The data on transport flows came from a study by the USDA Economic Research Service. 29 The PED outbreak data were derived from a report published on the website of the American Association of Swine Veterinarians.A detailed description of these data may be found in the Supplementary Note. We next discuss an important assumption made about the PED outbreak data here. 

Sensitivity analysis of simulated correlations

Since the data were highly aggregated and noisy, it was instructive for us to evaluate the performance of our correlation analysis under these conditions. To that end, we simulated the spread of a disease among individual U.S. swine farms, simulated a series of positive accessions, and then performed the correlation analysis on the simulated accession data. The model of disease spread included contact networks based on the spatial and transport structure of U.S. farms. The correlation analysis estimated the strength of association between the similarity of the time series of accessions between a pair of states with the measure of similarity according to either spatial or transport structure. Using previously described methods, 31, 32 we computed global sensitivity indices up to second order for the mean value of these correlations for the parameter space given in Table 1 . These indices estimate the fraction of the variance in the correlation that is due to variation in individual parameters or pairs of parameters. This exercise did not validate our modeling assumptions, but rather evaluated self-consistency by showing the extent to which we could quantify and distinguish between different modes of spread given our assumed models of spread and observation. The procedure is described in further detail in the Supplementary Note.

Stability selection

To see if important variables were missing from our correlation analysis, we performed variable selection for a regression model of the cumulative number of outbreaks in each state. Candidate predictors were chosen based on availability and expected effects on either reporting rates or risk. In addition to transport-associated risk, we considered that the risk of an outbreak may depend on climate, the density of farms in an area, and on a farm's distance to other outbreaks. Table 2 contains a brief description of all the predictors considered and the Supplementary Note contains a detailed description.Most of our predictors were correlated with other predictors as well as with the total positive accessions in each state. For such data, fitting regression models with an elastic net penalty allows groups of correlated variables to be given similar effect sizes whereas other modelling approaches, such as stepwise approaches and the use of a lasso penalty, may lead to one variable in a correlated group being singled out and being given a too-large effect size. 33 In general for elastic net regression, the weight given to the penalty determines whether any variable is selected. Often, the goal of a regression analysis is to obtain a model with good predictive performance and the weight is chosen by cross validation. 33 By contrast, we have no need of a predictive model and are instead more interested in determining what variables are important to include in a model. Stability selection 34 provides a general method of identifying relevant variables. The main idea is to select variables that across many random subsamples of the data are selected with high probability by the elastic net with a given set of weights for the penalty. We use this procedure because it is less likely to select noise variables than is cross validation. 34 Further details are given in the Supplementary Note.

Time series regression modeling

To estimate how farm density and transport flows may affect transmission rates, we fit the parameters c i and η in the following regression modelwhere We fitted these models to data from all 48 contiguous states with the assumption that the observed positive accessions I i,t+1 have a negative binomial distribution with an unknown, but constant, dispersion parameter which we denote with θ .This parameter is related to the variance by Var(We assumed that the random effect Z i is normally distributed. Then the likelihood is fully specified. We calculated marginal likelihoods with the Laplace approximation and numerically found the parameters that maximised it. In some cases we fixed η to 0.5, which allowed the model to be fully fit with both the lme4 35 and glmmADMB 36 packages in R. 37 To make sure our results were not sensitive to η = 0.5, we used R's optimise function to find the value of η in [0, 5] with highest likelihood. We performed several diagnostic checks of our fits, including checking for signs of nonlinearity with partial residual plots and for signs of temporal autocorrelation in the residuals.We also verified that the flows term is significant in models lacking random effects, and after excluding any data points with dfbetas 38 above 0.2.

Pairwise correlations are sensitive to transmission and contact parameters

Before we present the correlation analysis on the empirical PED data, we first consider the sensitivity of the correlations to the parameters of a model of disease spread among farms in the U.S. swine herd. A large portion of the variance in our simulation output was stochastic. The value of 1 − R 2 for our mean metamodel was 0.53, 0.46, and 0.18 respectively for correlations

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/017178 doi: bioRxiv preprint between the lag-1 cross correlation matrix and the distance, shared border, and transport flow matrices. Figure 2 shows that parameters with the highest sensitivities were the transmission probability for transport edges, the amplitude of seasonal variation in transmission probabilities, and the resolution of the raster grid used to generate spatial edges. All correlation types typically increased with transmission probabilities across transport edges, with those of the transport flow matrix increasing the most (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). All correlation types typically increased as spatial resolution decreased and the spatial contact network became more dense (Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Sensitivity to the spatial transmission probability was noticeable only on the more dense spatial network (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Seasonal variation in the transmission probabilities tended to reduce correlations (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4 ). Correlation size was indicative of statistical significance ( Supplementary   Figs. S3-S5 ). In summary, the largest sensitivities were to transmission and contact parameters, and these parameters had unsurprising relationships with the matrix correlations.

Similarity in outbreak count time series is correlated with transport flows

To provide insight into the relative importance of spatial and transport-associated transmission for PED, we applied the correlation analysis to data from the 2013 epizootic. We found that lag-1 cross correlations of positive accessions were positively correlated with the logarithm of transport flows. This relation held whether flows and cross correlations were treated as directional (Fig. 3a) , were averaged over both directions ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ), or were ranked ( Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8). The size of the correlation was comparable to those seen in our simulations for high transmission probabilities across network edges (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The p values for these correlations were all below 0.05 / 6, which means that they would remain significant after using a Bonferroni method of limiting the probability that any false positives occurred in our tests to 0.05. On the other hand, in no case would the correlations between geographic distance and cross correlations remain significant after such a correction. The correlations between the cross correlation matrix and the shared border matrix were similar to or weaker than those of the distance matrix, were not significant after Bonferroni correction, and were not included in the plots to keep them simpler. Analogous results hold for lag-0 and lag-2 cross correlations. Although higher lags are potentially informative, we did not attempt to analyse them as they were typically smaller, had more skewed distributions, and had greater uncertainty.The flows were themselves correlated with the distance between state centres, and these distances were in turn correlated with cross correlations (Fig. 3a) . Thus we also calculated the partial correlation of flows and cross correlations, controlling for distance. This partial correlation was around 0.31 whether directed or undirected relationships were used, and thus controlling for distance does not greatly diminish the correlation.

Numbers of farms and balance sheet variables were stable predictors of total outbreak counts

The Mantel test found a significant correlation between transport flows and cross correlations but did not account for many potential confounding variables. To address that limitation, we performed variable selection on a panel of candidate variables to identify those with the most robust associations with cumulative burdens of PED. Using stability selection with data from 42

Among the 22 states reporting positive accessions, swine inventory and marketings were selected as predictors of the total number of positive accessions. Marketings is the total number of swine shipped out of a state or slaughtered.

Transport flows and farm density are jointly associated with increased transmission

To obtain a rough estimate of the effect of flows on transmission rates that accounted for other effects such as seasonality and farm density, we fitted the case data to time series susceptible-infected-recovered models. Figure 4 displays the predicted and observed marginal relationships between flows and positive accessions for one of the models. Although our flow variables were based on the outcome of variable selection, they are not equivalent to any of the variables in the variable selection procedure and the data analysed here has a time dimension not present in the data used for variable selection. Thus to confirm the statistical significance of the within-state flows, we conducted a likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that models lacking terms for within-state flow were sufficient. The test favoured rejection of models without within-state flows (χ 2 1 = 12.9, p = 1.6 × 10 −4 ).Among those models containing flows, undirected models, which assumed that flows increased contact rates in both source and destination states, fit best, and directed models, which assumed that flows increased contact of susceptible farms in the destination state to infective farms in the origin state, fit worst (Table 3) . However, the parameter estimates were generally similar for all of these models, with flows having an appreciable effect (Fig. 5 ).

Discussion

Our first main finding is that our correlation analysis method may for a range of parameter values remain sensitive to transmission and contact parameters of interest in spite of receiving partial, biased, and noisy data about the state of simulated epizootics as input. In short, the signals generated by the heterogeneity in the structure of the swine herd were not drowned out by the substantial noise generated by the observation model. The potential of herd structure to strongly influence the dynamics of swine diseases has been noted in previous work, 39 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/017178 doi: bioRxiv preprint opinion to set them. 41, 42 Estimates such as ours may thus be key for determining what parameter values are consistent with past epizootics.What features of the time series might have driven the results in our correlation analysis? The correlation between transport and cross correlations seemed to be driven in part by concentration of both high cross correlations and large flows in Midwestern states ( Supplementary Fig. S1) . The cross correlations of these states results from the presence of a small wave of positive accessions early in the outbreak and a much larger wave toward the end of our observations (Fig. 3b, left column) . Also, Kansas and Oklahoma share a distinctive period of high positive accessions in the middle of the time series and fairly large flows (Supplementary Fig. S9 and Fig. 3b) . Epidemiological reports suggest that windborne transmission was important for spread in Oklahoma, and thus the summer activity in Kansas and Oklahoma may also have been a consequence of short-distance, spatial spread. It is not known how the spread in these states occurred in spite of the high temperatures that were thought to have slowed PEDV transmission in other states during the summer. North Carolina is distinct from the Midwest in that no outbreaks occurred in the spring and many outbreaks occurred in October (Fig. 3b) . Epidemiological reports suggest that PEDV was introduced in the Midwest and eventually reached North Carolina via transport. The high number of sow farms in the state may have allowed for a largely self-sustained cluster of outbreaks following introduction. Although the matrices measuring spatial transmission may not have come out as significant in our analysis, consideration of the epidemiological explanations for the time series suggests that spatial transmission may to some extent explain the significance of the transport flow matrix.Both epidemiological and statistical mechanisms may explain why the undirected model fit best (Table 3 ) and why pairaveraged flows had higher correlations than directed flows (e.g., Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S6) . A possible epidemiological mechanism is that trucks arriving to pick up loads are introducing the virus to farms. A possible statistical mechanism was seen in our simulations. We noticed that even though transport contact was based on directed transport flows, symmetrised matrices had slightly higher correlations than asymmetric matrices.Our analyses were likely limited in power by inaccuracies in our variables measuring population structure. For example, the transport flows used excluded transport to harvest plants, and such movements have been observed 10 to result in the contamination of trailers. Another concern is the coarseness and age of the flow estimates. In support of them being sufficiently informative, previous phylogeographic analysis 43 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/017178 doi: bioRxiv preprint farms tend to specialise on specific production stages. But if larger farms did not experience more PED outbreaks but only reported them with higher probability, that could provide a false signal that flows are associated with risk. A phylogeographic analysis or analysis of suitably structured epidemiological data could establish an association between flows and spread of PEDV that is not subject to such confounding.

Conclusions

Both the objectives, identifying variables relevant to the risk of infection, and challenges of our data analysis, uncertain reporting rates and many correlated candidate predictors, are common in epidemiological studies. Two reasonable steps toward such an objective are to assemble as many relevant explanatory variables as possible about reporting rates and measures of exposure based on prior scientific knowledge and then to determine if the available data support the conclusion that these variables are relevant. Our general contribution has been to provide a worked-out example of how variation in the structure of the population across a large scale may allow for the identification of variables with relevance to mechanisms of spread. We have also demonstrated the use of stability selection and regularised regression for the task of filtering out noise variables from a set of candidates. These examples may serve to provide analysts with new ideas about how to make the most efficient use of often limited epidemiological data, hopefully leading to more rapid understanding of transmission and how to stop it.

"Abstract

Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23 rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xi'an. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of ""resumption of work"", show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10 th and February 4 th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.

","Introduction

Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, with a spherical shape and crown-like spines, from which their name derives. They generally cause mild respiratory infections but can sometimes be fatal. Since their first discovery and molecular characterization, three major spread out globally [2 ,6, 8, 11] , causing approximately 80,000 cases and 2,400 deaths as of February 22 nd 2020 [13] .Since January 23 rd 2020, the Chinese authorities have been implementing unprecedented and increasingly stringent public health interventions, including a complete lock-down of Wuhan and neighboring cities, strict contact tracing and travel restrictions in the epicenter and across the country [13] . Incorporating these interventions into the classical epidemic models has resulted in reliable estimates of epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 transmission in the epicenter and accurate near-casting the epidemic trend and peak time [18] [19] [20] , in comparison with other earlier modeling studies focusing on analyzing the transmission risk based on data at the early outbreak stage [1, 3, 4, 17] . One important lesson gained from our recent experience suggests the need of updating the model parameters and model setting to reflect the rapid improvement of screening, diagnosing and testing techniques/procedures, accompanied by intensive contact tracing, quarantine and isolation.The feasibility of enhancing model capacity to assess transmission risk and evaluating intervention effectiveness has also been substantially increased due to the improvement of the quality of the data, specially from other Chinese cities and provinces where the complete lock-down of major cities such as Wuhan in the Hubei province has prevented a significant portion of infection importation, so the reduction of imported cases coupled with intensive contact tracing produced some high quality data with rather complete information on symptom onset time and transmission-chain, as will be discussed in the data section below. This enhanced model capacity for near-casting is particularly important, since the gradually relaxing of the travel restriction demands proactive-and real-time assessment of the risk of a potential second outbreak in other Chinese cities. An objective of our study is to provide this assessment, and to use this assessment along with the incorporation of feasible public health interventions into our stochastic disease transmission model to suggest the scale of interventions for these cities to prevent a second outbreak. As COVID-19 spread has occurred in many regions globally, we believe our study provides an important tool to inform public health decisions regarding travel restriction and social distancing in these regions according to their public health capacity to maintain an effective contact tracing, quarantine and isolation procedure.In order to achieve the above research objectives, we examine the transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic in other areas outside Hubei province and quantify the risk of case importation into the current outbreak which is expected to end soon, and into a potential secondary outbreak due to the ""resumption of work"" in these areas. We focus on the effectiveness and implementation timeliness of prevention and control strategies, as well as the choice of timing for the ""resumption of work"" and its impact on the risk of a secondary outbreak.Our analysis is based on the complete ""tracking and recording"" information of imported cases and local cases detected in the province of Shaanxi province [7] , as this allows us to generate a data set that includes the time series of daily latent, infected and hospitalized cases. Since the outbreak scale in the Province of Shanxi was relatively small and this is subject to stochasticity in both case importation and local cases generated by the importation and since the Provincial data has detailed information on symptom onset and serial intervals, we adopt a method developed by Nishiura and Chowell [15, 16] to estimate the effective reproduction number, and we revise some of our early deterministic models to a novel discrete stochastic model to address the key issues relevant to preventing a secondary outbreak of COVID-19 in other provinces except for Hubei, due to the anticipated gradually relaxing of travel restriction and returning to normal social and economic activities.

Data

We obtained the data of laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCov cases in Shaanxi province from the ""National Health Commission"" of the People's Republic of China and the ""Health Commission"" of the Shaanxi Province [7, 13] . It is worth mentioning that very detailed data information for each confirmed case has been released. This strict contact tracing strategy gave detailed information of illness onset, the first medical visit, quarantined period and confirmation. Then the data do not only include numbers, such as the number of newly reported cases, the cumulative number of reported confirmed cases, the cumulative number of cured cases and the number of death cases, and the cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases (shown in Figure 1(A) ), but also include the information such as the dates of illness onset, first medical visit, isolation, laboratory confirmation and discharge, and/or date of coming into Shaanxi (for imported cases). The data were released and analyzed anonymously.Based on the recorded information, we can get the daily number of latent, infected and hospitalized individuals, and we call these data sets as traced data, as shown in Figure 1 (A-C).Note that that daily number of hospitalized cases means the first medical visit and then being quarantined rather than daily number of confirmed cases. Further, we collect the data of population mobility from the website of Baidu Qianxi (http://qianxi.baidu.com). It contains the trend of inflow of population to Shaanxi before the 2020 Spring Festival and after 2019 Spring Festival, as shown in Figure 2 (B).

Let

and be the number of newly imported cases and the number of newly confirmed imported cases on day t in Shaanxi province.represents the duration from importation to confirmation for imported cases. For k consecutive days j = 1 , … , , is assumed to follow the Poisson distribution with mean (that has to be estimated). Given the daily number of newly confirmed imported cases 1 , … , on m consecutive days 1 , … , and the probability = ( − ≤ < − + 1) that an imported case entered Shaanxi province on day j and was confirmed on day i. We assume that for each j, = ∑ =max { , 1 } is positive. Then parameters 1 , … , can be estimated by 1 , … , and through deconvolution method.We use the Richardson-Lucy iterative algorithm [5] to solve this problem. The procedure is iterative according to the following formulas:where ( ) and ( ) are fitted values of and in the n-th iteration respectively. We stop the iteration when the error of fittingbecomes small and the value of 1 ( ) , … , ( ) are reasonable. Because the method above requires that = ∑ =max { , 1 } is positive, which means that at least some fraction of imported cases who entered Shaanxi province on day j would be confirmed during the period 1 , … , , we then can determine the proper 1 and 2 such that > 0 for 1 ≤ ≤ 2 in terms of the distribution of . By using the same method, given the daily number of confirmed local cases and the probability distribution of the duration from infection to confirmation for local cases, we can also estimate the daily number of newly infected local cases on day t during some time period.To estimate the effective reproduction number ( ), we make an adaptation of the method in [15, 16] to allow for imported cases. With the same notations and assumptions above, for ( ) we haveis the discretized distribution of the serial interval with G(τ) being the cumulative distribution function. Let ℎ be the duration from importation of a primary imported case to infection of the secondary local case, ℎ = H( ) − H(τ − 1) is the discretized distribution of ℎ with H( ) being the cumulative distribution function.

The model

On the basis of the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures we stratify the populations as susceptible ( ), exposed ( ), infected ( ), hospitalized ( ), recovered ( ) compartments, the quarantined susceptible ( ) and quarantined suspected individuals ( ). The flow diagram is shown in Figure 3 . Note that here the model framework extends the model structure in our previous study by including the quarantined suspected compartment [18] [19] [20] , which consists of exposed infectious individuals resulting from contact tracing and individuals with influenza like illness and common fever needing clinical medication. The deterministic model is replaced by a discrete system with stochastic importation since the case numbers are relatively small with most of the early cases being imported in Shaanxi province [10, 12] . This modelling approach can well describe demographic stochasticity. The where the random variables in (1) can be defined by binomial Bin(n, p) distributions as follows [10, 12] : Let constant m be the transition rate from susceptible class to the suspected compartment via general clinical medication due to fever or illness-like symptoms. The suspected individuals leave this compartment at a rate of , with a proportion, f , if has been confirmed to be infected by the COVID-19, going to the hospitalized compartment, whilst the other proportion, 1-f , has been proven to be not infected by the COVID-19 and goes back to the susceptible class once recovery.Let the transmission probability be β and the contact rate be c. With contact tracing, we assume a proportion, q, of individuals exposed to the virus is quarantined, and can either move to the compartment B or S q at a rate of βcq or (1 -β)cq), depending on whether they are infected or not, while the other proportion, 1 -q, consists of individuals exposed to the virus who are missed from contact tracing and move to the exposed compartment E at a rate of βc(1 − q)once infected or stay in compartment S otherwise. All definitions of variables and parameters have been listed in Table 1 .The imported latent, infected and suspected and hospitalized cases for each day can be Since the implementation of the lock-down strategy in Wuhan on January 23 rd 2020, the prevention strategies in other parts of mainland China have been continuously strengthened. In order to truly describe the constantly strengthening of control strategies, we should consider the contact rate, quarantine rate, diagnosis rate and cure rate as the functions of time t. In this model, we assume that the contact rate c(t) is a decreasing function with respect to time t, given bywhere c 0 denotes the baseline contact rate at the initial time (i.e. before January 23 rd , 2020) with c(0) = c 0 , c b denotes the minimum contact rate under the current control strategies with lim t→∞ c(t) = c b , where c b < c 0 , and r 1 denotes the exponential decreasing rate in the contact rate.Similarly, to characterize the enhanced contact tracing we define ( ) as an increasing function with respect to time t, written as ( ) = � 0 , before Jan 23nd ,2020where 0 is the initial quarantined rate of exposed individuals with (0) = 0 = 0 in Shaanxi All rights reserved.

We also set the transition rate ( ) as an increasing function with respect to time t, thus the detection period 1/ ( ) is a decreasing function of t with the following form:, before Jan 23nd ,2020where δ I0 is the initial rate of confirmation, is the fastest confirmation rate, and 3 is the exponential decreasing rate of the detection period. Definitely, (0) = 0 and lim →∞ ( ) = with > 0 . Let be the time point at which stringent control measures are introduced on Jan 23nd, 2020. Until February 4 th 2020, there was no cured case in Shaanxi province, so the cure rate should be zero before February 4 th 2020. The number of discharged patients has increased rapidly since February 7 th 2020. Therefore, the cure rate is defined as a constant piecewise function based on the real situation.

Simulation of the resumption of work

When simulating the resumption of work, we assume that the movement trend of Shaanxi p � H may reduce 30% , 60% and even 90% corresponding to weaker and weaker epidemic.

Data implications

From the detailed description about traced data, we can know when and what is the state of each infected person and obtain the number of who are in latent (or quarantined latent), infected and hospitalized classes, as shown in Figure 1 , which shows the evolution process of the epidemic in Shaanxi province. Figure 1 (A) gives both newly reported cases and new cases from traced data, and comparison of two time series indicates that the new cases from traced data is about 7 days ahead of the reported cases data. In particular, Figure 1 (B) and (C) give the epidemic status of cases confirmed before February 7 th and 15 th , respectively. Note that although Shaanxi province began to release the case numbers on January 23 rd , 2020, the first imported latent case came to Shaanxi as early as January 10 th , 2020, and the majority of imported cases were latent and came into Shaanxi before the end of January, 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (A). Figure2(B) shows the correlation between the total imported cases and the number of population flow into the Shaanxi province, from which we calculate the proportion of those inflows that are infected.We can also illustrate the spatial distribution of imported cases (circles) and local cases (squares) and disease evolution based on the traced data. It follows from Figure 4 that most cases are inXi'an city, few cases are in the northern part of Shaanxi while relatively many cases are in the southern part of Shaanxi, which is adjacent to Hubei province. Therefore, we can estimate the impact of population migration on the epidemic situation in the neighboring areas of Hubei Figure 7 (A). It is interesting to note that we can get the part of new infections before February 12 th , 2020 from the recoded traced data in Shaanxi province, shown in Figure 7 (B). It shows that the estimated new infections agree well with the traced data in terms of trend. We note that for some cases, their information is not complete, only the dates of illness onset or first medical visit are recorded, and hence they cannot be considered as new infections at certain dates. That is why the real new infections from traced data are less than the estimated ones, shown in Figure 7 (B).To estimate the effective reproduction number we let the distribution of serial interval be chosen as gamma distribution with mean of 7.5 days and standard deviation of 3.4 days [4, 11] .Because the distribution of the duration from importation of a primary imported case to infection of the secondary local case ℎ is unknown, we initially set ℎ be equal to and then estimate the effective reproduction number R(t), as shown in Figure 7 (C). It shows the effective reproduction number started to decline on January 23 rd , 2020 when the prediction and control strategies was strengthened, was less than 1 since around January 27 th , 2020, and stabilized at almost 0 recently, which means few new infections occur. In order to investigate the variation of the effective reproduction number with ℎ varies, sensitivity analysis was carried out by changing the mean of ℎ from 1 to 7 days, as shown in Figure 7 (D). It shows that the more the mean of ℎ , the greater duration of the R(t) being greater than 1 and the earlier the R(t) exceeds the unity.All rights reserved.

Does resumption of work induce the second outbreak

Since the Spring Festival holiday most people have been at home, when do they return back to work/study is a challenging problem. Consequently, we investigate the effect of population movement on infections, especially on the possibility of inducing the second outbreak. To this end, we initially estimate the unknown parameters by least square methods, listed in Table 1 , by fitting the discrete stochastic model to the traced data between January 10 th to February 7 th (purple curve with dots), and by using the mean parameter values of 1000 times of least square estimations (listed in Table 1 ) we get 500 stochastic trajectories of model (1), as shown in Figure 8 (A-C). To investigate the effect of resumption of work on the epidemic, especially on possible second outbreak, by which we may suggest the public health sectors when workers can return back to Shaanxi, we predicate the disease infection by using the data on imported cases and moving from other cities to Shaanxi province (shown in Figure 2 ). Suppose population to start to return back to Shannxi province from February 24 th to March 9 th , 2020, we can see from Figure 9 the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027615 doi: medRxiv preprint

Discussion

Shaanxi province is located northwest of China, adjacent to Hubei in the south. Therefore, except for Xi'an city, the capital of Shaanxi, many confirmed cases are in the southern part of Shaanxi province. It is interesting to note that Health Commission of Shaanxi Province released the case number every day with very detailed information, by which we can know when and who infected whom. Then except for the new reported (or cumulative) number of confirmed cases, we can get the daily number of individuals who are in latent (or quarantined latent), infected and hospitalized compartments, which gives the evolution process of the epidemic in Shaanxi province. We can get the durations from illness onset to the first medical visit, to the hospitalization, and to confirmation of the case. These durations are relatively smaller than those for mainland China or Hubei province [3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17] , which implies that the control measures implemented in Shaanxi are timely and medical resources are relatively sufficient.From the detailed data description, we can obtain the transmission chains over the time, which enable to calculate the control reproduction number under the implementation of stringent control strategies. The mean control reproduction number ranges from 1.48 to 1.69, and the distribution of these chains agrees well with the effective reproduction number. Note that the effective number has been declining, and is less than unity since January 27 th 2020. Recently it has stabilized at almost zero, meaning that no new infections occur, which seem to be in line with real data, as shown in Figures 1 and 7 [7] .In this study we extend our deterministic model framework [9, [18] [19] [20] ] to a discrete system incorporating stochastic modeling of imported cases to represent the relatively small number of cases observed in the Shaanxi province, with about half of them being imported cases. It is worth noting that traced data is around 7 days ahead of the reported ones, as illustrated in Figure 1 (A).Moreover, detailed data records revealed that the time interval between the first visit to a doctor and confirmation was longer, with a median of around 4 days. Then, the number of reported cases is not suitable to identify the model or estimate the parameters due to delays such as report delay, confirmation delay, etc. Therefore, it is not accurate to associate the number of confirmed cases with the number of cases in hospital, which may seriously overestimate the scale of the epidemic. Therefore, the multiple traced data sets have been employed to identify the proposed discrete stochastic model and estimate the unknown parameters in this work. Consequently, we use the number of individuals in E, I, and H classes form traced data rather than the newly (or cumulative) reported number to parameterize the model.We investigate the impact of population movement (resumption of work) on the potential second outbreak by using movement data from other cities to Shaanxi province. Our main results indicate that the proportion of imported cases is a key variable in order to determine All rights reserved.

The greater the proportion of imported cases the larger the second outbreak has. Furthermore, intermittent importation may induce one further outbreak episode but with small peak values.From our study, we can conclude that it is very important to study the epidemic situation of COVID-19 by using data from contact tracing rather than simply using the number of confirmed cases, especially in the areas where the imported cases are the main source of infection. This can not only provide important data information for the accurate evaluation of the epidemic situation in other areas outside Hubei Province, but also provide important and accurate data supporting the evaluation of the effectiveness and timeliness of public health intervention strategies in different areas.In the present investigation, we devised a stochastic model that can be used as an important model framework and methodology for the evaluation of imported cases on local epidemic in the Shaanxi province or other similar provinces. From the data analysis, it seems that the stringent public health interventions adopted by the Chinese authorities are effective in controlling the infection. According to data from contact tracing, the first imported cases in the Shaanxi Province occurred earlier than January 10 th 2020, and most of the imported cases were imported to the Shaanxi Province before the implementation of the national travel restrictions on January 23 rd 2020. Therefore, the earlier the implementation of the travel restrictions, the greater the reduction of infected cases by COVID-19 in the Shaanxi province has. An intermittent population inflow with low proportion of imported cases may significantly mitigate the transmission risk. Thus, if the public health authorities can strictly monitor and reduce the number of imported cases, it would be possible for the Shaanxi province to return back and resume working continuously.

Conclusions

It is very important to study the epidemic situation of COVID-19 by using traced data rather than simply using the number of confirmed cases, especially in the areas where the imported cases are the main and the epidemic situation is not serious. This can not only provide important data information for the accurate evaluation of the epidemic situation in other areas outside HubeiProvince, but also provide important and accurate data support for the evaluation of the effectiveness and timeliness of public health intervention strategies in different areas.We proposed a stochastic model which can provide an important model framework and methodology for the evaluation of imported cases on local epidemic in the Shaanxi province (and can eventually be adapted for other similar provinces of China). Data analysis reveals that strengthening the public health interventions, tracing imported cases and improving the confirmation rate are effective and timely after January 23 rd 2020. According to the traced data shown in Figure 1 , the first imported cases in Shaanxi Province were earlier than January 10, and most of the imported cases were imported to Shaanxi Province before the national travel restrictions were implemented on January 23nd, as shown in Figure 2 . Therefore, the earlier implementation of travel restriction will greatly reduce the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province, which was not serious.The findings suggest that keeping an intermittent population inflow with a low proportion of imported cases may induce a small second outbreak and hence decrease the transmission risk.Thus, if we can strictly monitor and reduce the number of imported cases, it is possible for Shaanxi to resume work continuously, especially intermittently. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027615 doi: medRxiv preprint the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027615 doi: medRxiv preprint Figure 3 .

"Abstract

The Mad1-Mad2 heterodimer is the catalytic hub of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which controls mitosis through assembly of a multi-subunit anaphase inhibitor, the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) [1, 2] . Mad1-Mad2 first catalyzes MCC assembly at interphase nuclear pores [3] , then migrates to kinetochores at nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and resumes MCC assembly until bipolar spindle attachment is complete [1, 2] . There is significant debate about the factor(s) involved in targeting Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores in higher eukaryotes [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Through gene editing and livecell imaging, we found that the human Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex is dispensable for cell viability and initial recruitment of Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores at NEBD, but then becomes necessary to tether Mad1-Mad2 at kinetochores and sustain SAC arrest in cells challenged with spindle poisons. We also show that RZZ forms the mesh-like fibrous corona, a structural expansion of the outer kinetochore important for timely chromosome congression [10-13] once Mps1 phosphorylates the N-terminus of Rod.Artificially tethering Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores enabled long-term mitotic arrest in the absence of RZZ. Conversely, blocking early RZZ-independent recruitment of Mad1-Mad2 eliminated the transient SAC response in RZZ-null cells. We conclude that RZZ drives structural changes in the outer kinetochore that facilitate chromosome biorientation and chronic SAC transduction, a key determinant of cytotoxicity during antimitotic drug therapy [14-16]. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.ResultsRecent studies have reached different conclusions about the specific roles and relative importance of Bub1 and the RZZ complex in targeting Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores and transducing SAC arrest [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . To interrogate RZZ function with maximum penetrance, we used AAV (adeno-associated virus)-and CRISPR-mediated gene editing to target the KNTC1 (Rod) locus in HCT116 cells, a diploid colorectal cell line ( Fig. S1A-C) . The resulting KNTC1 HF/-(hypomorph-flox) cells expressed Rod at ~20% of the wildtype level ( Fig. 1A -B and S1D) and exited mitosis prematurely when microtubule polymerization (nocodazole, 99 ± 6 min s.e.m.) or Eg5-dependent spindle bipolarity (S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC), 193 ± 9 min s.e.m.) were inhibited, whereas wildtype cells never exited mitosis during the 16-hour timelapse (Fig. 1A-B) . To determine if complete loss of the RZZ complex is compatible with clonogenic survival, KNTC1 HF/cells were transduced with an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (AdCre) and subjected to limiting dilution.

","RZZ promotes chromosome congression and Mad1-Mad2 retention at unattached kinetochores

Basal mitotic timing was longer and more heterogeneous in RZZ-deficient cells ( Fig.   2A ), suggesting a delay in bipolar attachment and SAC satisfaction. Consistently, KNTC1-null cells rapidly exited mitosis when the SAC kinase Mps1 was inhibited with reversine ( Fig. 2A) . To monitor mitotic chromosome dynamics and SAC signaling, we expressed and imaged H2B-mCherry and FLAP-Mad1 using spinning disk confocal microscopy. At NEBD Mad1 immediately localized at nascent kinetochores, then dissociated as chromosomes congressed at the metaphase plate ( Fig. 2B ; n=10 cells). Congression was less efficient in KNTC-null cells, consistent with the lack of Spindly and dynein at kinetochores ( [17] and Fig. S2 ), with small numbers of Mad1positive chromosomes temporarily at the spindle poles ( Fig. 2C; n=14 cells) . We conclude that RZZ accelerates (but is not strictly required for) chromosome biorientation.Next we examined Mad1 dynamics in nocodazole-treated cells. Although Mad1 was again targeted to kinetochores at NEBD, without RZZ its localization could not be maintained (Fig. 2D ). To confirm this result for endogenous Mad1, wildtype and KNTC1 -/-RPE cells were treated with nocodazole and MG132 (to block mitotic exit) for 30 min or 4 hours, then fixed and analyzed by IFM. In wildtype cells Mad1 formed crescent-shaped structures that were stable over time (Fig. 2E, left panel) . By contrast, in KNTC1-null cells Mad1 formed small dots that later disappeared from kinetochores

Kinetochore expansion is thought to accelerate mitotic 'search and capture' by promoting lateral microtubule attachment [10] and to enhance SAC signaling [11] . RZZ is closely related to endomembrane coatomers that form oligomeric lattices [18, 19] and has been suggested as a ""building block"" of the corona itself [17, 20] . Consistently two other corona-associated proteins (CENP-E [21] and CENP-F [22] ) also failed to form crescents in KNTC1 -/cells (Fig. 3A) . To obtain definitive evidence, we performed correlative light-electron microscopy in cells that also express CENP-A-GFP as a centromere marker. Serial sectioning revealed circumferential expansion of trilaminar plates and fibrous material in wildtype cells (n=14 kinetochores), whereas the kinetochores of KNTC1 -/cells appeared as compact discs (n=15; Fig. 3B and Fig. S3 ).Kinetochore crescents disassembled when Mps1 was inhibited (Fig. 3C ). We identified two Mps1 phosphorylation sites at the N-terminus of Rod (T13 and S15), upstream of its beta-propeller domain [23] . To test their function, wildtype (WT) and nonphosphorylatable (2A) Rod were expressed in T-Rex FLP-in HeLa cells as LAP (EGFP-TEV-S-peptide) fusions (Fig. S4A ). Both versions were incorporated into RZZ based on co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. S4B) . Thereafter we introduced a KNTC1-specific guide RNA (sgKNTC1) via lentiviral transduction and triggered gene disruption using a Cas9-expressing adenovirus (AdCas9). Endogenous Rod was removed from kinetochores in 75% of cells (Fig. S4C) . We then analyzed transgene-All rights reserved.

While LAP-Rod WT and LAP-Rod 2A both localized to unattached kinetochores, only LAP-Rod WT formed crescents (Fig. 3D) . Thus far the only post-translational modification known to be required for crescent formation is Cterminal farnesylation of Spindly, which enables its kinetochore recruitment via interaction with Rod's beta-propeller domain [17, 20, 24] . In contrast Rod 2A recruited Spindly normally (Fig. 3E) . Despite recruiting less Mad1 to kinetochores, Rod 2A sustained mitotic arrest in nocodazole as effectively as Rod WT (Fig. 3F ). We conclude that Rod's N-terminal phosphorylation activates Spindly-RZZ for kinetochore expansion but is not necessary for RZZ-mediated SAC transduction.Bub1 promotes kinetochore expansion in Xenopus egg extracts [11] but has not been evaluated in human cells. We used doxycycline-inducible CRISPR [25] to delete BUB1 in RPE cells with 60% efficiency as judged by IFM, with 42% of cells exiting nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest in less than 800 min ( Fig. S4D-E) . Large kinetochore crescents containing RZZ, Mad1, and CENP-E (but lacking CENP-F) formed in BUB1 -/cells ( Fig S4D) . We conclude that Bub1 is not required for RZZ-mediated kinetochore expansion or Mad1-Mad2 recruitment, but is needed to localize CENP-F and potentially other corona-associated proteins.

Tethering Mad1 to kinetochores allows long-term SAC maintenance without RZZ

SAC failure in RZZ-null cells correlates with Mad1-Mad2 loss from kinetochores (Fig. 2 ).However this did not exclude the possibility that RZZ has other essential roles in SAC All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/297580 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7 signaling, such as activating Mad1-Mad2 for catalysis. To address this issue we expressed mCherry-Mis12-Mad1 [26, 27] from a doxycycline-inducible promoter in cells undergoing acute deletion of KNTC1 (Fig. 4A) , so that Mad1-Mad2 was tethered to kinetochores in an RZZ-independent manner (Fig. 4B ). This caused a longer arrest in KNTC1-null cells (1138 ± 428 min) than wildtype cells (791 ± 285 min; Fig. 4C ), potentially due to the lack of dynein-mediated stripping of SAC mediators from metaphase kinetochores [28] [29] [30] . To eliminate this effect and evaluate the SAC response to unattached kinetochores, we repeated these experiments in the presence of nocodazole and found no significant difference between KNTC1-null and wildtype cells (Fig. 4C) . Thus, Mad1-Mad2 tethering is sufficient to explain how RZZ extends the timeframe of SAC surveillance and mitotic arrest by a factor of 10.

Aurora B and RZZ target Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores and promote SAC transduction on complementary timescales

NPC-bound Mad1-Mad2 generates MCC during interphase, thereby increasing the SAC's sensitivity and robustness [3] . This contribution was revealed when cells bearing an NPC-defective Mad1 allele were treated with Aurora B inhibitors, which delay kinetochore recruitment of Mad1 relative to NEBD [31, 32] . Under these conditions, cells entered mitosis without premade MCC and could not generate it quickly enough at kinetochores to prevent mitotic exit [3] . Because RZZ-deficient cells initiate but do not maintain the SAC, we anticipated a similar synthetic interaction with Aurora B inhibition.To test this idea, RPE cells co-expressing FLAP-Mad1 and mRuby-CENP-A were All rights reserved.

Hesperadin slowed but did not prevent Mad1 recruitment to unattached kinetochores in wildtype cells (Fig. 4D -E) and did not override nocodazoleinduced SAC arrest [3, 31, 33] . In contrast hesperadin blocked Mad1 targeting to kinetochores in KNTC1-null cells (Fig. 4D -E) and decreased mitotic arrest from 110 ± 20 min to 39 ± 10 min (Fig. 4F ). As the latter corresponds to the basal length of mitosis in RPE cells ( Fig. 2A) , these data imply combined loss of SAC initiation and maintenance at kinetochores, while pre-programmed anaphase delay via nuclear pore-generated MCC remains intact.

Discussion

The RZZ complex is conserved in metazoans and other taxa [18, 35, 36] , but its roles in SAC signaling and kinetochore organization remain poorly understood. Our studies define RZZ as a critical SAC maintenance factor, the major Mad1-Mad2 tether at kinetochores, and a key mediator of phosphodependent kinetochore expansion.Genetic loss of RZZ was tolerated in three different cell lines that vary in tumorigenicity, p53 proficiency, and karyotypic stability. In this regard RZZ differs from core SAC components like Mad1, Mad2, Bub1, BubR1, and Mps1 that are essential for organismal and (with rare exceptions [9, 37, 38] ) somatic cell viability in mammals [3, 34, [39] [40] [41] [42] . It was recently proposed that RZZ and Bub1 both transduce the SAC at unattached kinetochores, whereas only Bub1 monitors improper kinetochore-All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/297580 doi: bioRxiv preprint microtubule attachment [7] . However KNTC1-null RPE cells exhibited severe SAC failure when kinetochore attachments were ablated with nocodazole or when STLC or taxol were used to induce erroneous attachments (Fig. 1D ). We conclude that RZZ is required for SAC transduction in both settings.Through live imaging, we obtained evidence that human kinetochores recruit Mad1-Mad2 and transduce the SAC in two distinct steps. The first occurs at NEBD, when Mad1-Mad2 released from nuclear pores is targeted to newly assembled kinetochores by Aurora B [3, 31, 43] . In the second step, Mad1-Mad2 becomes stably tethered to kinetochores by RZZ, extending SAC surveillance and mitotic arrest more than 10-fold.When both steps are abrogated, cells neither initiate nor maintain the SAC and thus exit mitosis with kinetics set by nuclear pore-derived MCC [3] .Compelling evidence indicates that Bub1 is the kinetochore receptor for Mad1-Mad2 in yeast and nematodes [44, 45] . In contrast, studies in mammalian cells differ as to (1) whether Bub1 recruits Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores and (2) whether and how Bub1 contributes to SAC arrest [4-7, 9, 41] . Recently several groups reported that the SAC in human cells is refractory not only to Bub1 depletion [4, 6] but also stable disruption of the BUB1 locus [9, 46] unless Mps1 is partially inhibited to sensitize the system [9, 47] .In our studies, acute deletion of BUB1 induced highly penetrant SAC failure without perturbing the kinetochore localization of RZZ and Mad1-Mad2 ( Fig. S4D-E) . These findings suggest that Bub1 supports SAC transduction by accelerating step(s) in MCC All rights reserved.

Transgenic expression of LAP-Rod 2A and mCherry-Mis12-Mad1 rescued nocodazole-induced SAC arrest but not kinetochore expansion in KNTC1-null cells, implying that the latter is not rate limiting for SAC transduction. This inference is supported by the fact that mitotic arrest following Eg5 inhibition (which generates compact kinetochores with syntelic attachments [50] ) is also RZZ-dependent ( Fig. 1B and 1D ).Although kinetochore expansion is known to depend on mitotic kinases like Mps1 [11] , relevant substrates are not known. We found that Mps1 promotes expansion by phosphorylating Rod on two N-terminal residues upstream of its beta-propeller domain.Recent studies indicate that Rod and Spindly not only interact via this domain [17, 20] but also inhibit their own self-assembly into polymers [51, 52] . In light of these findings and the fact that Mps1 maximally phosphorylates Rod at unattached kinetochores [23] , we propose that this modification overcomes the barrier to Spindly-RZZ polymerization and kinetochore expansion. Thereafter end-on microtubule attachments reverse this phosphorylation, in part through counteracting PP2A-B56 phosphatases [23] , thus reinhibiting Spindly-RZZ and facilitating kinetochore compaction. In summary, we have identified a key trigger for dynamic kinetochore expansion that involves SAC-All rights reserved.

"Abstract

There has been an outbreak of coronavirus disease in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China since December 2019. Cases have been exported to other parts of China and more than 20 countries. We provide estimates of the daily trend in the size of the epidemic in Wuhan based on detailed information of 10,940 confirmed cases outside Hubei province.

","

More than 500 cases have been detected outside China. Despite the considerable medical resources and personnel that have been dispensed to combat COVID-19 in Hubei province, hospital capacity continues to be overburdened. There continues to be a shortage of hospital beds needed to accommodate the rising number of COVID-19 patients. In response to this growing crisis, Wuhan plans to transform hotels, venues, training centers and college dorms into quarantine and treatment centers for COVID-19 patients. Further, 13 mobile cabin hospitals will be built to provide over 10,000 beds. [2] Therefore, a careful and precise understanding of the potential number of cases in Wuhan is crucial for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak. Wu et al. (2020) provided an estimate of the total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, using the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China. [3] However, since the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China is small, their estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan may not be precise and has large variability.

In this article, we propose a new statistical method to estimate daily number of cases in Wuhan under a similar dynamic equation model as the one in [3] . Unlike the one in [3] , our method can also handle the missing information on whether a case is exported from Wuhan.

Results

We estimate the number of cases that should be reported in Wuhan by January 11, 2020, is 4,094 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3,980 -4,211) and 58,153 (95% CI: 56,532 -59,811) by February 13, 2020. Figure 1 shows how the estimated number of cases in Wuhan increases over time, together with the 95% confidence bands. As shown in Figure 2 , the reporting rate has grown rapidly from 1.41% (95% CI: 1.37% -1.45%) on January 20, 2020, to 61.89% (95% CI: 60.17% -63.66%) on February 13, 2020.

Data Description

Data retrieved from publicly available records from provincial and municipal health commissions in China and ministries of health in other countries included detailed information for 10,940 confirmed cases outside Hubei province, including region, gender, age, date of symptom onset, date of confirmation, history of travel or residency in Wuhan, and date of departure from Wuhan. Among the 7,500 patients with gender data, 3,509 (46.79%) are female. The mean age of patients is 44.48 and the median age is 44. The youngest confirmed patient outside Hubei province was only five days old while the oldest is 97 years old.We display the epidemiological data categorized by the date of confirmation in Table 2 .An imported case means a patient that had been to Wuhan and was detected outside Hubei province. A local case means a confirmed case that had not been to Wuhan. Among the total of 10,940 cases, 6,903 (63.10%) have such epidemiological information. The number of imported cases reached its peak on January 29, 2020, and the fourth column of Table 2 shows that the proportion of imported cases declines over time. This might reflect the effect of containment measures taken in Hubei province to control the COVID-19 outbreak. [5] Meanwhile, the daily counts of local cases are over 300 from February 2, 2020, to February 7, 2020, which indicate that infections among local residents should be a major concern for authorities outside Hubei province.The last column of Table 2 lists the mean time from symptom onset to confirmation for patients confirmed on each day. The median duration of all cases is 5 days, and the mean is 5.54 days. In general, the detection period decreased in the first week after January 20, 2020, but increased since then. The improvements in detection speed and capacity might cause the initial decline, and the rise may be due to more thorough screening, leading to the detection of patients with mild symptoms who would otherwise not go to the hospitals. [6] Assumptions The proposed method relies on the following assumptions:1. Between January 10, 2020, and January 23, 2020, the average daily proportion of departing from Wuhan is .2. There is a = 1 + 2 -day window between infection to detection, including a 1day incubation period and a 2 -day delay from symptom onset to detection.3. Trip durations are long enough that a traveling patient infected in Wuhan will develop symptoms and be detected in other places rather than after returning to Wuhan. .

Methods

The spread of COVID-19 outside Hubei province is relatively controlled given the adequate medical resources. We use the reported number outside Hubei as it is a fairly accurate representation of the actual epidemic situation. In this modelling study, we first estimate the epidemic size in Wuhan from January 11, 2020, to February 13, 2020, based on the confirmed cases outside Hubei province that left Wuhan by January 23, 2020. Since some confirmed cases have no information on whether they visited Wuhan before, we adjust the number of imported cases after taking these missing values into account. We then calculate the reporting rate in Wuhan from January 20, 2020, to February 13, 2020. Finally, we estimate the date when the first patient was infected..

Model

The growth trend of the size of infected population is determined by the following ordinary differential equation:where K is the size of the population that are susceptible to COVID-19 in Wuhan, and r is a constant that controls the growth rate of . This is the simplified version of the famous SIR model [3, 7] in epidemiology. It is a good model at early stage of the epidemic when the number of recoveries is still relatively small compared to infected cases. The growth rate of .

Estimation

We use data on the confirmed cases who left Wuhan between January 10, 2020 and January 23, 2020, to estimate K.

Table 4 summaries the estimate the number of cases should be reported on January 11, 2020, and February 13, 2020, under baseline assumptions and alternative scenarios. Confidence intervals are omitted. The currently reported number 35,991 on February 13, 2020, is substantially smaller than the estimate of our most conservative scenario.

Conclusions

The estimated reporting case rate has increased rapidly, reaching over 30% by February 11, 2020. It is almost doubled in the following two days, mainly due to the inclusion of 14,031 clinically diagnosed cases in the case reports of Wuhan. This might indicate that the testing capacity of Wuhan is insufficient. Clinical diagnosis could be a good complement to the current method of confirmation. The currently reported number of 35,991 cases as of February 13, 2020, is still far below our estimate of 58,153. There may still be a lot of unreported cases. More thorough screening of all patients with a mild or moderate symptoms of respiratory diseases should be conducted to better control the spread of COVID-19.

"Abstract

Over the course of the last several million years of evolution, humans likely have been plagued 8 by hundreds or perhaps thousands of epidemics. Little is known about such ancient epidemics 9 and a deep evolutionary perspective on current pathogenic threats is lacking. The study of past 10 epidemics has typically been limited in temporal scope to recorded history, and in physical 11 scope to pathogens that left sufficient DNA behind, such as Yersinia pestis during the GreatPlague.

","27

About 40 years ago and for the first time in their evolution, humans eradicated a virus that had 28 claimed countless lives, the Variola virus known as the causal agent of smallpox (Metzger et al., may be unusually high due to large human populations in contact with other species, even much 36 less frequent viral zoonoses during the millions of years of past human evolution are likely to 37 have resulted in many epidemics.

38

When viruses impose a selective pressure on a host, adaptation happens in response at 39 the host loci that interact with the virus (Enard et al., 2016 ). An epidemic can then be detected 40 through the enrichment in signals of adaptation at VIPs that interact with a virus. One obstacle 41 to utilizing this method is that we do not have a direct access to the interactions between a host 42 and an ancient virus. However, host-virus interactions are well known in present viruses. of knowledge of ancient viruses can be explained by the difficulty to recover ancient viral DNA 70 (Spyrou et al., 2019) , and by the fact that many viruses have their genomes coded by RNA that 71 is known to degrade much faster than DNA. In light of the scarcity of molecular remains, how 72 can we identify the viruses that drove ancient epidemics during human evolution?

74

In order to identify viruses that drove ancient epidemics, we can use present interactions 75 as proxies for the interactions with ancient viruses from the same phylogenetic family. Using this 76 approach, we previously found evidence that 50,000 years ago 

104

Among available haplotype-based statistics, the iHS or integrated Haplotype Score (Voight et 

121

We further ask whether specific types of viruses drove recent adaptation more frequently 122 than others. More specifically, our previous results on adaptive introgression from Neanderthals 123 to modern humans , and the known zoonoses from the recent past 124 (Geoghegan et al., 2017; Kreuder Johnson et al., 2015) , suggest that RNA viruses may have 125 driven more recent adaptation than DNA viruses because they jump more often from a species 126 to another. The vast majority of known zoonotic viruses that infected humans in the recent past 

141

First, using all VIPs compared to non-VIPs, we find a strong enrichment of iHS selective 142 sweeps at VIPs overall, suggesting that viruses were a major selective pressure during recent 143 human evolution that drove multiple strong adaptive events. Second, we further find that the 144 selective sweeps enrichment is much more pronounced at RNA VIPs compared to DNA VIPs.

145

These results validate previous results and are consistent with RNA viruses being a significant 146 selective pressure in the past 50,000 years of human evolution.

151

We use a dataset of ~4,500 VIPs that are human proteins known to interact physically with 152 viruses (Table S1 ). Of these, we previously manually curated 1,920 from the virology literature 153 (Methods). The articles that report these interactions also frequently report their effect on the 154 viral replication cycle, and 66% of the manually curated interactions also have reported proviral 155 (interaction is beneficial to viral proliferation), or antiviral effects (interaction is detrimental to the 156 virus) (Methods). While this percentage is high, it is still likely to be an underestimate due to the 157 fact that it is limited to the cases where the effect of the interaction has been investigated in the 158 first place. This makes VIPs prime candidates for host adaptation, with a strong likelihood of 159 functional mutations affecting the viral replication cycle. The remaining ~2,600 VIPs were 160 identified using high-throughput methods and were retrieved from the VirHostnet 2.0 database 161 as well as from a number of additional studies (Table S1) . For this analysis, we pooled the 162 manually curated and the high-throughput VIPs together into one group that we systematically 163 compared to the rest of the genome. In total, 20 viruses that infect humans have more than 10 164 VIPs and 14 viruses have more than 100 VIPs, with influenza virus (IAV) and HIV having the 165 highest numbers of known VIPs (1,505 and 1,209 respectively; 

209

For instance, VIPs are more highly constrained, more highly expressed than non-VIPs, and 

257

Using this strategy, we find that VIPs are enriched for recent selected sweeps with The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.997346 doi: bioRxiv preprint genes far from them, we do not observe any enrichment of strong selective sweeps (Fig 2B) .

303

We nevertheless observe some enrichment when using the rank thresholds from top 2,000 to 304 top 500, suggesting weaker sweeps signals at DNA VIPs. These results suggest that RNA with sweeps in control genes that belong to none of the VIP-enriched GO annotations (Fig. 3) . If 337 GO annotations rather than viruses explain our results, we expect the genes from the VIP-338 enriched GO annotations to be significantly enriched for sweeps compared to other genes.

339

Because the confounding effect should be independent from viruses, we should be able to 

438

To determine a window size that would more specifically detect strong adaptation in the human 439 genome, we ran population simulations of incomplete selective sweeps and measured the 440 power of iHS to detect weak or strong adaptation when using different window sizes. In 441 particular, we used two window sizes, with small 50kb windows and much larger 1,000kb 442 windows. We ran the population simulations using discoal . Each

475

The bootstrap test we used to match VIPs with control non-VIPs that match for multiple 476 confounding factors has already been described extensively in a previous manuscript that the 477 reader can refer to for more ample details (Castellano, 2019 ). An implementation of the 478 bootstrap test is available at https://github.com/DavidPierreEnard, as part of a larger pipeline 479 that also estimates the whole enrichment curve p-value (see below). In brief, the bootstrap test 

526

It is important to note that we match many (11) confounding factors, which inevitably restricts 527 the number of non-VIPs that can be used as controls. Smaller numbers of control non-VIPs 528 increase the false positive rate of the bootstrap test (see below). However, the False Discovery

529

Rate analysis strategy that we use to test the significance of the whole curve enrichment fully 530 takes this limitation into account (see below). Note also that in order to limit the number of false 531 positive sweeps due to low recombination regions included in the bootstrap test, we did not use 532 genes with recombination rates estimated to be lower than 0.2 cM/Mb (Hinch et al., 2011) .

534

Testing the significance of the whole enrichment curve

535

In addition to estimating a p-value for each iHS rank threshold from top 2,000 to top 20 with the 536 bootstrap test, we also estimated how significantly the whole enrichment curve stands above 537 null expectations. We do this for multiple reasons, some of which already mentioned above.

538

First, the different thresholds across the whole curve are not independent from each other. As a 539 consequence, an excess of significant p-values at multiple thresholds may reflect a correlation 540 of false positives due to the dependence between thresholds. Second and most importantly, it is 541 very likely that we used the bootstrap test in conditions that make it non-nominal (meaning a 542 non-uniform distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis of no enrichment). Indeed, as we 543 mentioned in the results, we had to exclude many non-VIPs too close to VIPs (<500kb) to avoid 544 counting VIP sweeps as non-VIP sweeps, and vice versa. We also used only non-VIPs that 545 could match VIPs for a large number of confounding factors. The issue then is that we only had 546 a limited number of non-VIPs that were far enough from VIPs and that could be used as 547 controls. For example, for the VIPs vs. non-VIPs test, we could use only 1,704 control non-VIPs.

548

A smaller set of controls means that in the bootstrap test, the same control non-VIP has to be 549 . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

550

Smaller samples of control non-VIPs are inevitably related to (i) a higher variance of the control 551 null distribution, and (ii) also to a higher variance of the overall average of the null distribution.

552

Bias (i) can result in a higher rate of false negatives with a decreased power to detect an 553 significant sweep enrichment, but more alarmingly bias (ii) can on the contrary inflate the rate of 

557

This is a very serious limitation of our analysis, but fortunately there is a very simple, yet 558 computationally intensive remedy. Since we know that the bootstrap test is likely not nominal, 559 we can estimate the true False Discovery Rate associated with the whole approach, by re-560 running the entire analysis pipeline many times on randomized genomes where the iHS ranks 561 have been swapped randomly between genes. We specifically use 10,000 random genomes.

562

We can then estimate how significant the real enrichment curve from top 2,000 to top 20 is 563 compared to the same curved measured on the 10,000 random genomes. As a statistic to 564 estimate the significance of the whole curve, we use the difference of the observed number of 565 VIPs, minus the expected number according to controls, and we sum this difference over all 566 rank thresholds from top 2,000 to top 20 (Figure 1) . We then compare the real value of the 567 statistic for the real genome, with the distribution of 10,000 random values obtained from the 568 10,000 randomized genomes. For each randomized genome, we use exactly the same VIPs 569 and control non-VIPs as we did when testing the real genome, but these genes are now 570 associated with randomly swapped iHS ranks. The sample size of the control sets of non-VIPs 571 is exactly the same using random genomes as when using the real genome, meaning that the 572 results of the boostrap test reproduce exactly the same biases for the random genomes as 573 when testing the real genome. The p-value obtained for the whole rank thresholds enrichment 574 curve after 10,000 randomized genomes is thus an unbiased, nominal p-value that matches the 575 actual False Discovery Rate.

577

It is however very important to note that it is true that the randomized genomes provide an 578 unbiased, whole curve test, only because we do not randomize genomes in a completely 579 random fashion. If we just swapped randomly iHS ranks between genes, we would lose the very The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.997346 doi: bioRxiv preprint high-ranking iHS genes. In our case, it was therefore crucial to randomize iHS ranks between 584 genes in a way that conserved the same exact clustering structure between top iHS rank genes.

585

To achieve this, we cut the genes ordered as they are across human chromosomes in 100 586 blocks of contiguous genes, and then randomly shuffled these blocks. The size of the blocks is 587 much larger than the size of even very large sweeps of multiple megabases, thus ensuring that 588 the clustering structure of the top iHS rank genes is preserved within the blocks. Randomly 589 swapping the blocks still results in randomly swapping iHS ranks between genes within the 590 blocks. Because the randomized genomes obtained this way preserve the clustering of iHS 591 signals, we can still measure enrichments using the number of genes, instead of having to count 592 the number of sweeps. Note that the entire pipeline to get the whole enrichment curve p-value is 593 available at https://github.com/DavidPierreEnard with a user manual, together with the bootstrap 594 test.

597

To test whether host intrinsic functions can explain the sweep enrichment at VIPs and 598 particularly at RNA VIPs, we measured enrichment for sweeps among genes that belong to GO 599 functions that are over-represented in VIPs. Specifically, we tested whether genes that belong 600 to over-represented functions in VIPs are enriched for sweeps completely independently of 601 whether they interact with viruses or not, by completely excluding VIPs and genes at less than 602 500kb from VIPs (and more likely to overlap VIP sweeps) from the analysis. Thus, we used the 603 bootstrap test to compare iHS sweeps in 718 non-VIPs more than 500kb from VIPs that belong 604 to over-represented GO functions in VIPs (GO functions had to be found in 50 VIPs or more, 605 100% over-represented or more), with sweeps in 423 non-VIPs more than 500kb from VIPs that VIPs with no over-represented GO function. We ran the bootstrap test testing for a deficit of 611 sweeps in the 423 non-VIPs out of over-represented GO functions using the larger number of 612 non-VIPs with at least an over-represented function (the larger the pool of controls compared to 613 the tested set, the better). We also flipped the two groups when testing GO functions for RNA 614 VIPs for the same reason that it is always better to have the larger group being the control 615 group in the bootstrap test. We estimated the significance of the bootstrap test by measuring the 616 whole enrichment curve p-value as already described above. We used the same confounding 617 .

"Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased need for diagnostic testing using reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-PCR). An exponential increase in demand has resulted in a shortage of numerous reagents in particular those associated with the lysis buffer required to extract the viral RNA. Herein, we describe a rapid collective effort by hospital laboratory scientists, academic researchers and the biopharma industry to generate a validated lysis buffer. We have formulated a 4M Guanidinium thiocyanate (GITC)/ Triton X-100 Lysis buffer which provides comparable results with the recommended reagents. This buffer will ease the burden on hospital labs in their heroic efforts diagnose a large population of patients.

","Introduction

The global demand for reagents for real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) diagnostic tests for COVID-19 has caused a bottle neck across Ireland and the UK in efforts to follow the World Health Organisation's advice to ""Test, Test, Test"".Expansion of PCR testing is critical to gain control over the pandemic spread of COVID-19 and the world-wide shortage of lysis buffer is a rate limiting step. Here we disseminate details of a lysis buffer formulation that came into existence as a consequence of a rapidly formed multi-centre collaboration. A replacement lysis buffer for extraction of viral nucleic acids from respiratory samples was desperately needed by diagnostic laboratories.A panel of new lysis buffer formulations was generated and validated for use in COVID-19 testing by virus-specific RT-PCR and are being distributed throughout Ireland. It is hoped that by sharing the formulation and validation, we can make it useful to others in the national and international scientific community.The key chemical constituent of the lysis buffer (guanidinium thiocyanate) has become scarce, scientists from the School of Microbiology, University College Cork, combined their long-held knowledge of lysis buffers for RNA extraction, with insights from published work relating to extraction of RNA using magnetic glass beads (Chomczynski & Sacchi, 1987; Hui He et al., 2017) . Ultimately, they formulated a lysis buffer, which uses much less guanidinium thiocyanate than standard formulations appear to use (4 M compared to 6 M). Simultaneously, scientists at Teagasc, Fermoy were working on a different experimental formulation for lysis buffer (Boom et al., 1990) . Four laboratory preparations in total were tested for efficacy by medical scientists based in the Clinical Microbiology Department at Cork University Hospital (CUH), who conducted validation experiments using positive and negative samples. After validation, pharma-based scientists, generously prepared a large volume of the much needed 4 M GITC lysis buffer for distribution by CUH. 

Co-ordination/preparation of paper: Dr Brigid Lucey

It should be noted that the following chemical preparation, after validation was selected for use with named commercial platforms and testing kits. We recommend that each centre adopting it in their laboratories should first validate it for use with their own systems. It is also advisable to provide a lot number with each batch prepared for traceability.The 4 M GITC lysis buffer was developed based on the published method of Chomczynski & Sacchi (1987) , adapted for magnetic glass bead extraction (Hui He et al., 2017) , and validated against recognised standards using positive and negative controls. Details of the composition of 4 M GITC lysis buffer and for the preparation of 1 litre are given below.The lysis procedure used in the diagnostic laboratory mixes lysis buffer and sample 1:1, this generates a working concentration of 2 M GITC during the lysis step as reported to be optimal by Hui He et al., 2017.

Buffer Composition:

4 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GITC) 55 mM* Tris-HCl 25 mM EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) 3 % (v/v) Triton X-100 0.01 % (w/v) Bromophenol blue (*NOTE: calculated from the total amount of 0.1 M Tris pH 7.6 added, diluted by the degree of volume expansion observed when the GITC goes into solution).Preparation of one litre of 4M Guanidinium thiocyanate (GITC)/ Triton X-100 Lysis buffer (please also read risk assessment):1. 472.75 g of GITC is brought into solution initially by adding 400 ml of 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 7.6. This will require heating in a 65°C water bath and some shaking of the vessel (but with lid well secured). In our hands, once fully dissolved the volume of the solution was 600 ml. 2. Make up to 750 ml with 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 7.6. 3. Add 50 ml of 0.5 M EDTA, mix. 4. Add 30 ml Triton-X-100, mix 5. Volume made up to 1 L with 0.04 % (w/v) bromophenol blue (DEPC-treated water can be used instead)

Notes:

• See Appendix 1 for chemical agent risk assessment sheet • Use laboratory coat, safety goggles, gloves, chemical respirator dust mask (N95 mask) • Open containers of guanidinium thiocyanate powder should be handled in a fume cabinet • The balance for weighing should be positioned outside the fume cabinet (but close by).Receiving vessel must have a lid that can be sealed for weighing • Significant chemical or physical hazards notable when preparing buffer: poisoning and environmental hazards • Buffers made up with DEPC-treated molecular biology grade water • A significant increase in volume is observed upon GITC dissolution and the degree of volume expansion was found to vary between preparations performed at different sites. This may reflect variations related to the manufacture of GITC and/or storage conditions of the chemical and accentuates the need for individual site validation before use diagnostically..

No./ID: 79216) and a Roche external lysis buffer when testing positive (amplifying two Covid-19 specific targets) and negative controls. 

Results

Detection of targets was compared for crossing point values (Cp) for the four prepared buffers and the Roche external lysis buffer as shown in Table 1 . Automated extraction was conducted using the Roche MagNa pure LC and the PCR was performed on the Roche z480 RT PCR instrument. On a second day, the 4 M GITC buffer was tested in comparison with Roche and Qiagen buffers, using the IndiMag48 extraction system and RT PCR was conducted on a Roche LightCycler II 480 ( Table 2) . On the basis of these combined data, the buffer containing 4 M GITC was confirmed as suitable for use with the diagnostic systems in CUH. Figure 1 shows the relative performance of all buffers tested, measured using Cp values

Based on these data, the 4 M GITC lysis buffer was selected for future preparation and use when extracting respiratory samples for Covid-19.

Discussion

A 4 M GITC lysis buffer with 3 % (v/v) Triton X-100 has been shown to work very well in COVID-19 RT-PCR, it includes a detergent which helps to disintegrate the virus during extraction, bromophenol blue as a visual aid for addition of lysis buffer to clinical samples and has the advantage of using less of a scarce ingredient. The knowledge that 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GITC) is sufficient in this lysis buffer means the straitened global supply of this chemical can be shared more effectively to make more lysis buffer to perform more tests around the world and help the world to take back control against this pandemic virus.Heeding Dr Michael J.

In straitened times, society needs to pool its resources and expertise to best impact and this case study and validation represents a generous and rapid response from the scientific community, when called upon by the Academy of Clinical and Laboratory Medicine, at a time when large international commercial companies were unable to supply this vital reagent.In the midst of this combined effort, research and medical scientists in other parts of Ireland are communicating their validation results in turn. Part of the group effort in the case being described here is that of the two scientists in the University of Limerick, who prepared the risk assessment documentation for the report, while simultaneously making up buffer and supplying their nearest hospital laboratory at University Hospital Limerick.In an urgent situation, Irish scientists, academics and biopharma have worked collectively to pool expertise, technical know-how, chemicals from their research laboratories, their facilities, time, coordination and communication skills along with determination to develop a suitable replacement lysis buffer at scale in less than two weeks. Like hospital laboratories, third level research laboratories rely on buying ready-to-go kits and reagents to speed up their research. Fortunately, retention of the knowedge regarding the chemical composition of the buffers among the scientists allowed them to make up their own reagents from raw materials.

"Abstract

The ongoing novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, has engendered 25 numerous cases of infection and death. COVID-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection; 26 however, current recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates, low sensitivity, and 27 cannot identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting patient misdiagnosis and 28 impeding epidemic containment. Combining the advantages of target amplification and long-read, 29 real-time nanopore sequencing, we developed nanopore target sequencing (NTS) to detect SARS-30

","Introduction 38

An ongoing novel coronavirus pneumonia 

outbreak originating in Wuhan, China in 39

December 2019 has subsequently spread across China and worldwide, resulting in numerous cases 40 of infection and death 1 . Usually, COVID-19 has an incubation period of 2-7 days 2 with no obvious 41 symptoms, during which time the virus can spread from infected to uninfected individuals. 42 Therefore, early accurate diagnosis and isolation of patients is key to controlling the epidemic. 43Nucleic acid detection is the golden standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Real-time reverse 44 transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the most recommend testing method for 45 detecting the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2 3 . qPCR is specific, rapid, and economic, but cannot 46 precisely analyze amplified gene fragment nucleic acid sequences; thus, positive infection is 47 confirmed by monitoring one or two sites (depending on manufacturer guidelines). However, qPCR 48 exhibits high false-negative rates and low sensitivity in clinical application 4 , with only 30-50% 49 positive detection ratio. False-negatives facilitate epidemic spread through delayed patient isolation 50 and treatment, and patients mistakenly considered uninfected or cured following misdiagnosed 51 treatment results. Another recommend detection method, sequencing, is widely applied for 52 pathogen identification and monitoring virus evolution 5, 6 including SARS-CoV-2 7 , but requires 53 expensive equipment, operator expertise, and > 24 h turnaround time, rendering it unsuitable for the 54 current crisis. 55Several intelligent methods for RNA virus detection have developed including combining 56 toehold switch sensors 8 , which can bind to and sense virtually any RNA sequence, with paper-based 57 cell-free protein synthesis for Ebola and Zika virus detection 9, 10 , and the SHERLOCK method 58 based on CRISPR/Cas13a for Zika or Dengue virus detection 11 . A rapid SHERLOCK method with 59 visual results can detect SARS-CoV-2 12 and toehold switch biosensors could theoretically be 60 All rights reserved.

We also considered the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 86 (RdRP) region in orf1ab (Fig. 1) . For the virulence regions, 11 fragments of 600-950 bp were 87 designed as targets, fully covering the 9,115 bp region (Fig.1) , amplified by 22 specific primers 88 designed considering primer-primer interaction and annealing temperature, and potential non-89 specific binding to human and common bacterium and fungi genomes. To improve the sensitivity 90 orf1ab region amplification, we designed two pairs of nested primers to amplify 300-500 bp 91 regions to avoid amplification failures owing to site mutation. Finally, the 26 primers were 92 combined to develop the SARS-CoV-2 primer panel (Supplementary Table 1) . 93For sequencing, we chose a nanopore platform that could sequence long nucleic acid fragments 94 and simultaneously analyze the data-output in real-time. This allowed confirmation of SARS-CoV-95 2 infection within a few minutes after sequencing by mapping the sequence reads to the SARS-96CoV-2 genome and analysis of output sequence identity, coverage, and read number. Moreover, the 97 accurate nucleic acid sequence generated using our pipeline could indicate whether the virulence-98 related genes were mutated during virus spreading, thereby rapidly providing information for 99 subsequent epidemiological analysis. Additionally, as the MinION nanopore sequencer is portable, 100 NTS is also suitable for front-line clinics. 101 102 NTS results interpretation and limit of detection (LoD). To test the SARS-CoV-2 detection 103 efficiency by NTS, we used standard plasmids harboring COVID-19 virus S and N genes to 104 simulate SARS-CoV-2. Standard plasmids were individually spiked into background cDNA 105 All rights reserved.

NTS for all test samples was performed on one MinION sequencer 107 chip. Sequence data were evaluated at regular intervals using our in-house bioinformatics pipeline. 108By mapping output reads on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, all reads with high identity were calculated 109 for each plasmid concentration. For 10 min and 1 h sequencing data, reads mapped to SARS-CoV-2 110 significantly differed from those of negative controls in all replicates at concentrations ranging from 111 3000 to 500 (Fig. 2a) , and 3000 and 10 ( Fig. 2b ) copies/mL, respectively. This result confirmed that 112 high-copy samples could rapidly yield sufficient valid sequencing data for diagnosis, and by 113 extending the sequencing time, valid sequencing data could also be obtained from low-copy 114 samples. Notably, as more sequencing data could be achieved with additional sequencing time 115 Evaluation of the target distribution of these valid data revealed that in higher copies samples 119 (1000 and 3000 copies/mL), all targeted regions could be detected (Fig. 2c, d) . However, in lower 120 viral concentration samples (from 10 to 500 copies/mL), some targeted regions were lost (i.e., no 121 reads mapped; Fig. 2c , d), indicating that for low-quality or low-abundance samples, comprehensive 122 fragment amplification is difficult. Therefore, for accurate results, NTS cannot label a sample as 123 positive for infection by monitoring only one or two sites, as is customary for qPCR; rather, the 124 results from all target regions should be considered. 125Accordingly, we determined a scoring rule by referring to previous judgment rules 14-16 . Firstly, 126we counted the number of output reads with high identity to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, indicative 127 of high credibility for identification as SARS-CoV-2.

Scores were 131 summed to obtain the NTS score. We considered that a sample in which at least 50% fragments (6 132 fragments) are inconclusive or 2 fragments are positive (comparable to qPCR results) could be 133 defined as a positive infected sample (e.g., NTS score >2.4); 3-6 inconclusive fragments or 1 134 positive fragment indicated a highly suspect (inconclusive) sample (e.g., NTS score of 1.2-2.4); and 135 < 3 inconclusive or no positive fragments could be defined as negative sample (NTS score <1.2). 136To determine the NTS LoD, we used the defined rules to evaluate each replicate in the 137 simulated test. As the standard plasmids contain only 6 designed fragments (half of 12 designed 138 fragments for SARS-CoV-2), we defined the scoring as NTS score >1.2 indicates positive 139 detection, 0.6-1.2 is inconclusive, and < 0.6 reflects negative detection. We calculated the score of 140 the lowest concentration (10 copies) at different times according to this scoring method and judged 141 the positive detection rate. The results (Supplementary table 2) showed that 3/4 of the 10 copies of 142 the standard plasmids can be judged positive from 1 h. This result is consistent with the significant 143 comparation (Fig. 2b) , that the data for 10 copies standard plasmids is also significantly different 144 from the negative control from 1h. This result shows that our scoring system is reliable for 145 evaluating NTS test results, and the LoD (3/4 replicates positive) was determined as 10 copies/mL 146 with 1h sequencing data (1,372 to 43,967 reads per sample in a run with 24 samples). 147 148 SARS-CoV-2 detection using qPCR vs NTS.

On February 6 and 7, 2020, we parallel tested these 45 samples in two batches using 152 NTS (two chips) and qPCR (kit 2; Fig. 1 ). The 4 h sequencing output data (Fig. 4a ) revealed that all 153 19 samples defined as positive by qPCR were recognized SARS-CoV-2-infected by NTS, 154indicating good inter-test concordance.

Although this was 244 a silent mutation, its presence suggests that the virus may have undergone mutation during the 245 spreading process. Additionally, NTS was verified as capable of detecting all five pre-added 246 respiratory viruses in a single detection. This method also detected a co-infected case (SARS-CoV-247 2 and human influenza A virus H3N2) using a clinical specimen, illustrating the ability of NTS to 248 detect and distinguish respiratory viruses. Together, our findings indicate that NTS is highly 249 suitable for the detection and variation monitoring of current COVID-19 epidemics, directly from 250 clinical samples with same-day turnaround of results. 251At the time of this writing, the COVID-19 epidemic remains very severe. Accurate, rapid, and 252 comprehensive nucleic acid detection methods are needed to allow patients with suspected infection 253 to be isolated and treated as soon as possible, and to accurately confirm whether the patient is cured, 254 to prevent continued epidemic spread caused by misdiagnosis. The LoD of NTS was shown to be as 255 low as 10 copies/mL, rendering it 100-fold more sensitive than qPCR (e.g., some kits describe 256LoDs of 1000 copies/mL) and thus likely to decrease the high false-negative rate plaguing current 257 detection methods. In addition, the detection of co-infection may allow the prevention of disease 258 progression from mild to severe or might be useful to inform clinical treatment. Overall, NTS 259 combines sensitivity, broad detection range, same-day rapid turnaround time, variation monitoring, 260 and low cost (compared with whole-genome sequencing), making it the most suitable method for 261 the detection of suspected viral infections that cannot be effectively diagnosed by other methods. 262Moreover, the MinION, the smallest Oxford Nanopore sequencer, is smaller than a cellphone; when 263 equipped with a laptop computer for data processing, it thus allows rapid performance of NTS in 264 All rights reserved.

For data analysis, cloud analysis may also be 265 introduced for high-throughput detection 17, 18 . 266Several limitations of the current NTS method should be noted. Because the designed amplified 267 fragments are 300-950 bp in length, which constitute suitable lengths for detection by a nanopore 268 platform as nucleic acid fragments < 200 bp cannot be readily detected 19, 20 , thereby, the sensitivity 269 of NTS for detecting target COVID-19 fragments in highly degraded nucleic acids may be 270 hampered. Additionally, although the turnaround time of NTS is longer than that of qPCR or other 271 possible nucleic acid detection methods (e.g., SHERLOCK 12 ), 6-10 h is considered acceptable for 272 clinical use; moreover, NTS is already the fastest strategy based on sequencing methods to date and 273can detect variations directly from clinical samples. Whereas the detection throughput of NTS is not 274 high at present, the NTS method can be integrated into widely used automated or semi-automated 275 platforms to improve the detection throughput in the future 21-23 . In addition, because PCR is 276 included in NTS, processes involving opening the lid of the PCR tubes may cause mutual 277 contamination between samples 24, 25 . However, this situation also is inevitable in current nucleic 278 acid detection methods (e.g., qPCR) or other nucleic acid detection schemes (e.g., SHERLOCK 11, 12 279 or toehold switch biosensor 9, 10 ) that also involve PCR. The introduction of integration systems or 280 sealed devices such as microfluidics may avoid this situation 26, 27 . At present, our processes of 281 sequencing data analysis and interpretation of results are not mature; nevertheless, as the number of 282 test samples increases, additional test results will be collected and the process continuously 283 optimized to obtain more accurate results. 284Notably, the comparison of NTS and qPCR results indicated a high false-negative rate in the 285 latter. This result highlights the need for extreme vigilance, as patient misdiagnosis (including 286 patients admitted and discharged) will lead to spread of the epidemic and greater public health 287 All rights reserved.

Suspected or negative results reported by the current qPCR methods should be subjected to a 288 more accurate method for secondary confirmation; for this, we consider NTS as the most 289 recommended solution currently available. The situation of co-infection, which has been reported in 290 our previous study 13 , also warrants continued attention. Based on the current centralized treatment 291 strategy, the lack of screening for multiple viruses may lead to large-scale cross-contamination and 292confound clinical diagnosis and treatment. Alternatively, NTS represents and effective strategy that 293 can rapid and accurate distinguish SARS-CoV-2 and multiple respiratory viruses at both the species 294 and subtype level, and could be applied as a spot check in centralized clinics.

"Abstract

1Background: The SARS-CoV-2 shares 74.5% genome identity with SARS-CoV, both 2 exhibiting a similar well conserved structure. Therefore, antibodies produced in COVID-19 and 3 SARS patients should not be that dissimilar. We evaluated SARS-CoV test assays to detect for 4 the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of 5 these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients. Methods: Tests were carried out using 6 ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM & IgG) methods on 7 serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was 8 seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 9 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by 10 the 3 rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients. The IIFA 11 method was marginally more sensitive compared to the ELISA assay, however the IIFA IgM test 12 was not useful in the early phase of the illness with poor sensitivity. Conclusions: Existing 13 diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV can detect antibodies in patients who were diagnosed with 14 COVID-19. These assays maybe be utilized as an interim measure in epidemiological 15 investigations for contact tracing and to determine the extent of community spread of this new 16 emerging virus pending the availability of specific serology tests for SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 is a new zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China which 19 was first reported on the 31 st December 2019. As the number of cases of COVID-19 increases, 20 there is an urgent need to understand this outbreak that looks set to spread to several countries 21 around the world. The total number of cases is probably a gross underestimate, as patients may 22 present with the symptoms of the common cold, and therefore remain undiagnosed due to the 23 mild nature of this illness in the majority. Poorer resourced countries may also not have the 24 capability to equip themselves with complex molecular diagnostic setups and thus outbreaks in 25 those areas may go undetected for some time and the number of cases under reported. 26 The SARS-CoV-2 is a SARS-related virus with 74.5% genome identity to SARS-CoV. 1 

27

The similarities between these two viruses were described comprehensively in a recent published 28 article by Xu et al. 2 For structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M), and 29 envelope (E), high within-group conservation was maintained, with more modest similarity seen 30 across the entire CoV family. In contrast, the accessory proteins that distinguish CoV infections 31 from each other with high variability across the family, allow viruses to adopt to current and 32 novel hosts. 3 In a study which described the difference in amino acid substitutions of different 33 proteins for SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV, it was found that there were no substitutions 34 that occurred in nonstructural protein 7 (nsp7), nsp13, envelop, matrix and accessory proteins p6 35 and 8b. 4 The N protein for SARS-CoV-2 has ~90% similar amino acid identity to the SAR-CoV 36 N protein and hence the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the N protein would likely recognize 37 and bind the SARS-CoV N protein as well. 5 Furthermore, a study by Zhou et al, showed that the 38 .

We identified SARS-CoV-2 positive cases which were confirmed by molecular testing of 49 respiratory specimens by real-time RT-PCR according to the published protocol by Corman et 50 al. 7 We retrieved residual samples left over from biochemical tests to obtain serial sera for these 51 patients. The Biochemistry department removed all patient identifiers and assigned random 52 numbers to each patient, and also included the number of days after onset of illness for each of 53 the retrieved specimens based on the information obtained from the Infectious Diseases team.

For negative controls, 10 samples which were sent for unrelated virology tests from 2 different 55 groups of patients were randomly selected.

There were a total of 7 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our institution 68 during the study period. A total of 26 samples were retrieved from the Biochemistry department.

The number of samples obtained for each patient ranged from 1 -9 (mean 3.7) with the earliest 70 taken 1 day after the onset of symptoms and latest at day 24. Five specimens were excluded due 71 to the narrow interval between samples or close proximity to the date of onset of illness. Figure 1 (<100, 100, 400, 1600, ≥6400) .

Although the overall results for the IIFA test may be more sensitive, 101 the IIFA IgM test in the COVID-19 patients was found to be less useful in the detection of acute 102 phase of the illness which is consistent with the findings of a study in SARS-CoV patients where 103 they found a less frequent (43%) and robust (less discriminatory) IgM response. 13 However, this 104 cannot be generalized as different assays will have different performances depending on the type 105 of antigen utilized.

Limitations of this study includes the relatively small number of patients and inconsistent 117 series of sera which ideally should have been collected at a predetermined regular time interval 118 to determine when IgM and IgG can be detected after infection in COVID-19 by these assays. 119 We also did not take into account other factors which could cause the delay in development of In conclusion, we provided proof of concept that the available SARS-CoV antibody 133 assays can reliably detect antibodies in patients with COVID-19 which could be used in this 134 current outbreak situation for serosurveys and as a diagnostic tool for under resourced countries.

"Abstract

The medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts.Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK -CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged ≥30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0.

","

Findings: 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which; 13 .7% were age>70 years and 6.3% aged ≤70 years with ≥1 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%). Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of ≥2 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age>70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with ≥3 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic may cause excess mortality over the next year in the population both because of deaths among those infected, and because people who are not infected are experiencing social and economic upheaval; meanwhile the ability of health services to provide high quality of care for both infected and uninfected patients is increasingly threatened.The net effect of mortality of this emergency on the population is thus not only a matter of modelling an infectious disease, but modelling the mortality effects of wider medical and societal changes. One way of estimating and monitoring excess mortality is to compare observed numbers of deaths with those expected based on the background (pre-COVID- 19) risks of death in the population(1).However, current models of the population mortality impact of COVID-19 are based on agestratified death rates over days in patients infected with COVID-19 and have not incorporated clinical information from NHS health records regarding prevalence of underlying conditions, their differing background (pre-COVID-19) long term mortality risks, or the impact of differing levels of additional risk associated with COVID-19 (2) . There have been limited reports so far of the excess deaths beyond those expected in specific high-risk populations (3, 4) . The majority of COVID-19 deaths reported so far have occurred in patients with underlying health conditions or at older ages (5-7); this situation is changing (SH personal communication) with severe infections being treated in younger COVID-19 patients without underlying conditions. Case fatality rates(CFR) for COVID-19 vary from 0.27% to 10% according to a metaanalysis(8), possibly explained by differing demography, testing strategies and prevalence of underlying conditions. However, population estimates are lacking, since cases need to be tested and most cases go untested. Moreover, since testing is more common in hospital patients, included individuals are sicker.Currently the UK government has not implemented full suppression strategies. Thus, for example, people are still 'socially close' in work and public places. Social distancing and other strategies have focussed on high-risk groups, with the CDC specifying ""older adults, and people who have serious chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and lung disease"" (9) . The UK government published guidelines on 16 March 2020, specifying particular population subgroups at high risk from COVID-19 infection (10) . Based on these guidelines, the UK has moved to the pandemic's ""delay"" phase and has recommended stringent ""socialdistancing"" measures telling people how to stay away from others (11) . Today (22 March 2020) the government announced that 1.5 million 'extremely vulnerable' people in England with underlying conditions (including COPD and heart disease) would be asked to 'shield' for 12 weeks, but did not release information on how this list was chosen and others not (12) .We provide estimates of 1-year mortality by underlying conditions in order to capture the potentially profound societal insult of the epidemic. We used the CALIBER resource as an open research platform with validated, reusable definitions of several hundred underlying conditions (13, 14) . This includes a sample of English data from the Clinical Practice Research Database and is linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics. For information governance and other reasons it is currently not possible for clinical researchers to access nationwide NHS data.Our objectives were: (i) to provide the research and policy community and public with parameters (prevalence, background pre-COVID- 19 1-year mortality risk by age and underlying conditions) to assist modelling; and (ii) to provide initial estimates of the excess COVID-19-related deaths over a 1 year period based on differing rates of infection. It is currently not known what the overall mortality impact of this emergency, which affects infected and non-infected patients will be. The relative excess in deaths in the winter compared to the summer months in the UK and many other countries is about 20%; our model in effect applies an additional all year round winter effect (i.e. relative risk of 1.2) (15-16). However, it is possible that the relative risk varies during the course of the pandemic, and at high levels of compromise in the workforce and health system, it is likely to be higher due to inability to provide timely care. Given concerns at the clinician and system levels, we therefore modelled an increased risk of mortality associated with COVID-19(RR 1.5 and 2.0).

Data sources

Our study had a cohort design with prospective recording of data and follow-up. 

Study population

Nearly all (>99%) of the English population is registered with a general practitioner; and the data used in CALIBER has been shown to be representative of the general population of England in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and overall mortality. Eligible individuals were ≥30 years of age and were registered with a general practice between 1 January 1997 and 1 January 2017 with at least one year of follow-up data. Demographic (age, gender, index of multiple deprivation (IMD) quintiles and geographic region) and baseline characteristics were recorded (17, 18) . The overall population at high risk of COVID-19 and recommended for social distancing was defined as per Public Health England guidance(10).The risk factors and diseases were defined using Read clinical terminology systems in primary care diagnosis and the 10th version of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) for hospital admissions as per previously validated CALIBER phenotypes (13, 14, (17) (18) (19) . Hypertension was defined based on recorded values in primary care according to the most recent guidelines: ≥140 mmHg systolic blood pressure (or ≥150 mmHg for people aged ≥60 years without diabetes and chronic kidney disease) and/or ≥90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure (17) . Diabetes was defined at baseline (including type 1, type 2, or uncertain type) on the basis of coded diagnoses recorded in CPRD or HES at or before study entry (18) . Severe obesity was defined as body mass index >=40kg/m 2 . CVD was defined as the 12 most common symptomatic manifestations: chronic stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, unheralded death from coronary heart disease, heart failure, cardiac arrest/sudden coronary death, transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, peripheral arterial disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm, as .

Analysis

We estimated the prevalence of each underlying condition and used Kaplan-Meier estimates of 1 year all-cause mortality in the English health records sample. We used the KM estimates in each age and number of conditions cell to estimate the number of excess deaths by age bands, and number of underlying conditions. We then modelled the excess mortality from COVID-19 for relative mortality risk associated with COVID-19 (relative risk, RR) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 (25, 26) , at the following infection rates in the UK population: ""fully suppress"" (0.0001%), ""partially suppress"" (1%), ""mitigate"" (20%) or ""do nothing"" (80%) (2, 27) . In order to project the study estimates of excess deaths to the whole UK population, we used 2018 estimates of overall population size and mortality(28). For illustration, we applied our study estimates to United Nations Population Fund(29) estimates of population size in other countries. All analyses were performed using R (version 3.4.3)..

Prevalence of underlying conditions

We included 3,862,012 individuals aged ≥30 years: 1,957, 935 (50.7%) female, 3,331,280 (86.3%) ≤70 years (mean age 43.5 in male and females) and 530732 (13.7%) >70 years (mean age 78.1 in males and 80.2 in females) (Suppl Table 1 ).At least 20.0% of the population aged ≥ 30 years had one or more high risk condition defined by PHE 16 March 2020 guidelines; of which 13.7% were age>70 years and 6.3% aged ≤70 years who had 1 or more underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%), chronic liver disease (0.02%), chronic neurological conditions (0.02%), splenic disorders (0.01%), immune disorders (0.001%), HIV/AIDS (0.005%) (Figure 1 ).

Multimorbidity

Multimorbidity was common (10.1%), especially in the presence of CVD, diabetes, CKD and COPD (Suppl Table 2 ). In individuals without CVD (mean age 47.5), diabetes (mean age 48.0), CKD (mean age 48.0) and COPD (mean age 48.2) respectively, 6.7%, 7.9%, 9.1%, and 9.7% still had a condition meeting criteria for social distancing. Hypertension was common: 7.4% and 31.7% in the ≤70 and >70 years subgroups respectively. In individuals aged ≤70 years, use of ACEI was not common (3.7%), compared with 14.9% in the >70 years subgroup.14.0% of the ≤70 years population used NSAIDs, compared with 21.1% in individuals aged >70 years.

Background (pre-COVID-19) 1-year mortality in underlying conditions

Mortality at 1-year was 4.46% among those aged >70 years or with one or more risk condition.Mortality was 6.4% (95% CI 6.2-6.5%) for CVD, 4.1% (4.0%-4.2%) for diabetes, 7.8% (7.6%-8.1%) for CKD and 8.6%(8.3-8.9%) for COPD (Figure 2) . Among those >70 years, one-year mortality rates for COPD, CKD, CVD and diabetes were 13.6(12.9-14.3%), 11.5%(11.0- 

Discussion

Using a small sample of the relevant clinical data that exist in the NHS we provide an initial population-based study estimating plausible ranges of excess mortality arising from the COVID-19 pandemic in England: we provide estimates of the background (pre-COVID-19) 1year mortality risks by underlying conditions at different ages; a major parameter that can be reliably estimated. There are implications of this rapid communication for policymakers, clinicians, and the public.

Policy: time for stringent suppression measures

These simple estimates of excess deaths suggest that the government should (like other countries) do more in the pursuit of suppressing the epidemic whether through ""enforced lockdowns"" or enforced social distancing rather than voluntary measures(30).We do not know what the relative impact of excess deaths from COVID-19 over a 1-year period will be; but the clinical concern in England over the last weeks is that 'this is not seasonal flu'. We show that if the emergency is associated with a 20% increased mortality risk, then there will be 13791 and 110332 excess deaths in mitigation and ""do nothing"" scenarios and 1 death under full suppression. A doubling of the risk, although unlikely, is worth considering due to uncertainty regarding the actual relative risk associated with COVID-19 and mounting healthcare burden around the world. It would result in 68957 and 551659 excess deaths in mitigation and ""do nothing"" scenarios respectively. A major concern is that these relative risks may change over time: for example if the health service is unable to cope. Even in the higher RR 2.0 model, full suppression would lead to virtually no excess mortality.

Policy: targeting 'extremely vulnerable' patients

Today (22 March 2020) the government announced that 1.5 million 'extremely vulnerable' people with underlying conditions would be asked to 'shield' for 12 weeks (12) . The mortality risk of the conditions on this new list was not reported, nor are the national NHS data defining these conditions readily accessible for research scrutiny. It is likely that patients with conditions not on the list (as shown in figure 3 ) may be at as high or greater mortality than those who are; for example, those with heart failure. Cardiovascular disease is not on the list and here we show that the 1 year mortality is 6%; we found that the 1 year mortality risk of people with 2 or more conditions was 11% -but multiple morbidities co-occurring in the same individual are not on the list.We demonstrate that on current criteria at least 20% of the population falls within the highmortality risk category; 13.7% based on age >70 years (an arbitrary cut-off) and a further 6.3%.

Clinicians and epidemic research

As clinical academics are re-directed to provide full-time clinical service, we believe it is 

Clinicians, healthcare workers and service

Primary care and secondary care healthcare workers have an important role in optimising guideline-recommended management of underlying conditions to lower the background risk.Missed opportunities for effective (secondary) preventive interventions are common in many countries in the management of non-communicable diseases, particularly CVDs, COPD and diabetes (31) . The concern is that with COVID-19 pressures these practical actions for clinicians now will not be addressed, and chronic disease management care might even deteriorate.

Legislation to mobilise NHS data for research

Research is a key part of the COVID-19 response, and we believe that the government should act, with legislation and other means, to massively mobilise publicly accountable access to nationwide NHS health and social care data across a large number of data custodians for researchers, clinician and policy makers NHS data across the whole country. Currently researchers can access only small (here in 5% of the UK population) samples, in which linkage to even simple data on hospital admissions requires multiple approvals, and can take years.Currently it is not possible to access NHS data on the COVID-19 epidemic as a nation-wide whole (it is fragmented by primary and secondary care, and fragmented across Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and England). Currently researchers cannot access detailed data .

Mobilising data cross government departments

Understanding how to mitigate the epidemic will require accessing and linking data about causes and consequences of this 'insult' across sectors including education, economy, transport. This is required in order to rapidly learn how to effectively respond to the COVID-19 epidemic. Social distancing policies may themselves influence the background mortality risks, as people may be less likely to access health and social care, and because social isolation has in many previous studies been shown to be associated with the onset and progression of cardiovascular and other diseases (34) . Thus it is possible that we may have under-estimated the true 1-year mortality risks. It is not known whether sudden and systematic social distancing (35, 36) , particularly if prolonged over months, has different or additional health consequences, compared to those reported from earlier studies of 'social isolation.

The public

We believe, has a right to see and interact with rapidly emerging research knowledge relevant to the epidemic. We provide readily understandable estimates of background (pre-COVID) 1year risk of death according to number of underlying conditions, by age and sex. This provides context for the daily reports of the numbers of deaths (the 'numerator'); at the time of writing, there are 177 deaths from coronavirus in the UK. It is not widely appreciated that on average 1400 people die every day in the UK (37) . Of all those people dying within 1 year, it is likely that COVID-19 'brings forward' the death earlier in the year. In other words there are competing causes for the mortality. The public may not be used to seeing 'heat maps' of mortality risk which sets the numerator in the context of the population at risk, the denominator but this may change.

International harmonisation of clinical data from electronic health records

International efforts are required to harmonise definitions of underlying conditions, and the clinical syndrome and progression of COVID-19 infection, using clinically collected data in EHRs. This is fundamental for the efficient generation of reproducible knowledge to address the pandemic. To date there have been limited efforts across national or other jurisdictions and it has previously been shown that clinical data are combined in more than 60 different .

Illustration in US and other countries

Countries differ in the availability of population-based longitudinal EHRs to estimate prevalence and mortality among underlying conditions. The age structure and age-specific prevalence of underlying conditions and their mortality also differs between countries(39).Nonetheless our estimates might be a relevant starting point for other countries; as an illustration we show estimates of excess deaths using the background mortality from the UK.

Limitations and further research

This rapid communication was developed over a 72-hour period prior to posting the results on 22 March 2020; and will be peer reviewed in due course. We seek to work with others to report further estimates of prevalence and mortality for cancer, pregnancy and chemotherapy, cause-specific mortality and cause specific hospital admissions (particularly respiratory) and critical care admissions, as well as the further conditions listed today (22 March 2020) (organ transplants, cystic fibrosis, specific cancers of the blood or bone marrow and immunosuppression (12) . There are many avenues for further modelling to better understand how to target different preventive interventions. An (incomplete) list includes statistical aspects (dynamic models, weekly rates of mortality, competing risks), public health aspects (regional variation, social deprivation and ethnicity), clinical aspects (including hospital and critical care admissions) and health service factors (including data on healthcare workers, and operational features). We have assumed that the impact (RR) of COVID-19 on excess mortality is the same across all risk groups, irrespective of how they are combined, which may not be the case. However, we researchers can use the estimate that we provide to allow modelling of such interactions in different subgroups within populations. We prioritised sharing estimates of 1-year mortality at a time when all clinical academics in the UK and around the globe are being called to the frontline (40) . In these times, our science must cross disciplines, disease specialisms and national and jurisdictional borders even more than before and we invite colleagues to improve, develop and validate our models and update estimates and projections using richer, more real time real-world data.

Conclusions

If the relative impact of COVID-19 on mortalty over 1 year were 20% (ie. same magnitude as the winter vs summer mortality excess) then the number of excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000, 14861 when 1 in 10 and 118885 when 8 in 10 are infected. However, if the relative .

"Abstract

We utilized a cell-level approach to examine glycolytic pathways in the DLPFC of subjects with schizophrenia (n=16) and control (n=16) subjects and found decreased mRNA expression of glycolytic enzymes in pyramidal neurons, but not astrocytes. To replicate these novel bioenergetic findings, we probed independent datasets for bioenergetic targets and found similar abnormalities. Next, we used a novel strategy to build a schizophrenia bioenergetic profile by a tailored application of the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures data portal (iLINCS) and investigated connected cellular pathways, kinases, and transcription factors using Enrichr. Finally, with the goal of identifying drugs capable of ""reversing"" the bioenergetic schizophrenia signature, we performed a connectivity analysis with iLINCS and identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists as promising therapeutic targets. We administered a PPAR agonist to the GluN1 knockdown model of schizophrenia and found it improved long-term memory. Taken together, our findings suggest that tailored bioinformatics approaches, coupled with the LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of chemical and genetic perturbagens may be employed to identify novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and related diseases.

","INTRODUCTION

Schizophrenia is a devastating illness that affects over 2 million people in the U.S. and displays a wide range of symptoms (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Cognitive impairment is a hallmark feature of the illness, and antipsychotics have poor efficacy in treating cognitive decline (7, 8) . The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a brain region heavily implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, possibly contributing to defects in working memory (9) . A variety of abnormalities have been reported in the DLPFC of schizophrenia patients, including changes in gene expression, cell density, receptor binding, and cerebral blood flow (10) (11) (12) .There is also accumulating evidence of bioenergetic dysfunction in chronic schizophrenia, which has recently been reviewed and highlights a number of abnormalities associated with glucose metabolism, the lactate shuttle, and bioenergetic coupling (13) . There is also evidence for genetic linkage between enzymes that control glycolysis in schizophrenia including 6phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2) and hexokinase 3 (HK3), suggesting that genetic risk for this illness includes bioenergetic substrates (14) . Interestingly, studies using cell-level techniques have demonstrated complex bioenergetic changes, including decreases in mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism genes in dentate granule neurons (n=22) and in layer 3 and 5 pyramidal neurons from the DLPFC (n=36 and n=19) (15) (16) (17) .Decreases in metabolic transcripts included lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenases (NADH), and ATP synthases. We have also recently demonstrated decreases in glycolytic enzymes (HK1, and phosphofructokinase muscle type, PFKM) and glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3) in pyramidal neurons, but not astrocytes, in the DLPFC of schizophrenia subjects (n=16) (18) . While examining the expression of individual targets is important, employing a signature based bioinformatics approach may help elucidate the pathophysiology of large biological networks. gene to determine if a knockdown signature has been catalogued in the database. By clustering the seed gene knockdown signatures in iLINCS, we are able to analyze the connectivity of the knockdown signatures (and thus establish a schizophrenia bioenergetic profile), identifying groups of L1000 genes that change concordantly following genetic perturbation. Furthermore, we can perform Enrichr analyses on these genes to gain perspective on bioenergetic pathology, describe potential multisystem pathological mechanisms, and inform pharmacological studies.Next, we aimed to identify therapeutic compounds with the potential to ""reverse"" glycolytic deficits as well as the associated changes in the L1000 genes. In order to select a potential drug intervention for preclinical testing, we relied on the 'connectivity' analysis to reveal positively (concordant) and negatively correlated (discordant) chemical (small molecule) and genetic perturbations. We developed a discovery based workflow to generate a list of small molecule perturbagens with L1000 transcript changes in the opposite direction of our knockdown signatures (based on concordance values from iLINCS, i.e. generating an ""inverse/discordant signature"") ( Figure 1 ). iLINCS provides over 40,000 transcriptomic profiles (signatures) of cell lines following treatment with chemical perturbagens such as FDA approved drugs, chemical probes, and screening library compounds including those with clinical utility and known mechanisms of action (19) . FDA approved drugs generated from this ""knockdown signature connectivity"" analysis could serve as candidates for therapeutic treatment in a preclinical model of schizophrenia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists had multiple hits in our analysis and similar drugs in this class are currently FDA approved for use in humans (21) .One of the leading hypotheses of the etiology of schizophrenia is glutamatergic hypofunction (22) (23) (24) . N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, particularly in human pharmacological studies (25) (26) (27) (28) . Converging evidence suggests that NMDA receptor hypofunction may actually reflect a dysregulation at the receptor level, including mutations in NMDA receptor subunits (29) . Several studies have found associations between the gene that encodes the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (Grin1) and schizophrenia (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) . The GluN1 knockdown mouse model has a ~90% global reduction of normal functioning NMDA receptors, achieved by targeted insertion of 2 kb of foreign DNA into intron 19 of the Grin1 gene (39) . Additionally, mice with mutations in the Grin1 gene have well-characterized behavioral endophenotypes for schizophrenia; this includes impairments in executive function and working memory, increased stereotypic behavior, decreased anxiety-like behavior, decreased sensorimotor gating, and abnormal social interaction (40) . Several of these behaviors are attenuated with typical and atypical antipsychotics at doses similar to those used in pharmacological models of schizophrenia (MK-801 or phencyclidine models), including hyperactivity, stereotypy, and sociability deficits (39, 41) . Therefore, the GluN1 knockdown mouse model is a viable and useful tool for studying the interface of NMDA receptor hypofunction, bioenergetics, and schizophrenia symptomology.There is evidence of abnormal bioenergetic pathways in GluN1 knockdown animals and other models of impaired synapses. For example, there is strong evidence linking lactate shuttle defects to NMDA receptor dysfunction in MK-801 treated rats and in GluN1 subunit knockdown mice (42) (43) (44) . Dysregulation of the energetic flow of lactate inhibits long term potentiation (45, 46) , and may contribute to cognitive deficits in GluN1 knockdown mice. Additionally, when lactate flow from astrocytes to neurons is stimulated, or when lactate is introduced to extracellular space, it enhances working memory and memory formation in rats (45) (46) (47) . Thus, drug-induced stimulation of lactate production coupled with behavioral studies in GluN1 knockdown mice could help elucidate the role of bioenergetic abnormalities in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.Pioglitazone is a member of the thiolazinedione (TZD) drug family (that appeared in our knockdown signature connectivity analysis) that is approved to treat type 2 diabetes and hyperglycemia (48) . Pioglitazone is a synthetic ligand for PPARγ, a nuclear receptor that is responsible for the regulation of several bioenergetic functions such as lipid homeostasis, adipocyte differentiation, and insulin sensitivity (48, 49) . Interestingly, PPARγ agonists have the ability to reduce oxidative stress (via mediating nitric oxide production) as well as modifying mitochondrial metabolism by interacting with proteins associated with mitochondrial function (mitoNEET proteins) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) . Activation of PPARγ via pioglitazone can also alter the transcription and expression of GLUT1, leading to changes in glucose uptake through PPARγ and other mechanisms (48, 54) . Thus, we hypothesize that treatment with pioglitazone will help restore cognitive endophenotypes associated with schizophrenia in the GluN1 knockdown model via stimulation of metabolic pathways.In our final experiment, we treated animals with pioglitazone and measured various behavioral outputs that are endophenotypes for schizophrenia (55, 56) . First, we assessed locomotor activity, stereotypic behaviors, and mania-like behavior. Next, we assessed executive function and cognitive flexibility using the puzzle-box test. This test requires the mouse to display problem-solving behavior as well as short-and long-term explicit memory to reach a goal area. To assess pioglitazone's effect on sociability, we used an ageand sex-matched mouse as a social stimulus (57) . Finally, we assessed sensorimotor gating using the pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle paradigm (58) . Taken together, these studies provide a bioinformatics translational approach to identify novel treatment strategies through the use of the LINCS library of signatures and connectivity analysis, coupled with the analyses of primary data and published work (to extend the set of 'seed' genes)..

Laser capture microdissection-quantitative polymerase chain reaction studies

We used laser capture microdissection coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (LCM-qPCR) to assess mRNA expression of our metabolic targets in enriched populations of astrocytes and pyramidal neurons in schizophrenia and control subjects (Table   S1 and S2). We have previously shown our LCM samples are enriched for specific cellsubtypes using neurochemical markers (11, 18, 59, 60) . No significant associations were found between pH, post-mortem interval (PMI), RNA integrity number (RIN), or age and any of our dependent measures. In a sample enriched for pyramidal neurons, we found decreases in PFKL (27%, p=0.010) and GPI (26%, p=0.015) mRNA expression (Figure 2 , p<0.05). We did not detect any significant changes in mRNA expression in samples enriched for astrocytes ( Figure   S1 ). To assess the use of antipsychotic medication in our patient population, we reanalyzed our significant cell-level targets with and without antipsychotic naïve subjects. All findings remained significant without these subjects (PFKL p=0.037, GPI p=0.034) ( Figure S2 , panels A and B).We also assessed the effects of antipsychotics on PFKL and GPI across multiple brain regions in the Stanley Medical Research Institute genomics database and detected an effect on GPI (p=0.006, fold change=1.09), but not PFKL (p=0.09, fold change=1.06). However, this effect was in the opposite direction of our findings, suggesting the decreased expression in pyramidal neurons in schizophrenia is not due to a medication effect. Additionally, we assessed the effects of ethanol use, smoking, and laterality on our dependent measures in schizophrenia subjects via secondary analyses of schizophrenia subjects on and off ethanol, smokers/nonsmokers, and left/right brain and did not detect any effects ( Figure S2 , panels C-H).

Generation of schizophrenia bioenergetic profile (seed genes)

We built a schizophrenia bioenergetic gene profile of 6 glycolytic genes based on data from our cell-level postmortem findings (HK1, PFKM, PFKL, GPI) and the literature (LDHA, PFKFB2). These ""seed genes"" were used in subsequent ""lookup"" replication studies, iLINCS clustering analyses (followed by Enrichr analysis), and iLINCS connectivity analyses (drug discovery analysis using ""inverse/discordant"" signatures). Figure 1 summarizes the bioinformatic work flow for both clustering and connectivity analyses.

""Lookup"" replication studies for seed genes

To replicate our bioenergetic findings, we performed in silico validation studies (""lookup"" studies) using three independent datasets (Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI), Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM), and a frontal cortical neuron RNAseq dataset generated from IPSCs of a patient with schizophrenia and DISC1 mutation (61)). Table 2 summarizes findings from this study and previous studies in our laboratory, as well as the mRNA expression of our selected seed genes (LDHA, HK1, PFKM, PFKL, GPI, PFKFB2) in each dataset.LDHA is significantly downregulated in both the SMRI (-1.11 FC, p=0.022) and frontal cortical neuron mRNA (-1.64 FC, p=0.018) dataset, while PFKFB2 was downregulated in the MSSM microarray dataset (-1.31 FC). Many seed genes were unchanged in the SMRI and MSSM datasets. However, the SMRI database is an aggregate of 5 brain regions and the MSSM dataset utilized blended samples from the whole DLPFC, while our findings are from cell-level studies. This is supported by 5/6 seed genes being above our fold change threshold in the cell-level frontal cortical neuron dataset.

Generation of seed gene knockdown signatures

We used iLINCS (http://ilincs.org) to retrieve knockdown signatures for each seed gene individually. Each seed gene knockdown signature (GPI knockdown signature, HXK1 knockdown signature, PFKM knockdown signature, PFKL knockdown signature, LDHA knockdown signature, PFKFB2 knockdown signature) is comprised of the transcriptional changes of 978 landmark genes (L1000 genes) when that seed gene is knocked down ( Figure   S3 ). Only signatures designated to be reproducible and self-connected (""gold"") by the Broad Institute are available. When multiple shRNAs are available for gene knock-down experiments, consensus gene knock-down signatures, as defined by iLINCS are used. To minimize variability, we compared signatures for seed genes using one consistent cell line (vertebralcancer of the prostate, VCAP).We used iLINCS (http://ilincs.org) to retrieve knockdown signatures for each seed gene individually. Each seed gene knockdown signature (GPI knockdown signature, HK1 knockdown .

iLINCS clustering analyses

For unsupervised clustering analyses, we used iLINCS to cluster the union of the top 50 differentially expressed L1000 genes from each of the 6 seed gene knockdown signatures using Pearson correlation coefficients (Figures 3 and 4) . Due to gene overlap between top 50 differentially expressed L1000 genes in seed gene knockdown signatures, this resulted in the clustering of expression data for 260 L1000 genes. We next used the dendrogram function in iLINCS to select panels of mRNAs with increased expression across clustered seed gene knockdown signatures (""panels of clustered upregulated genes"") and with decreased expression across clustered seed gene knockdown signatures (""panels of clustered downregulated genes"").These clustered gene panels (Table S3) were carried forward to two separate Enrichr analyses.With the goal of identifying panels of correlated transcriptomic changes in our seed gene knockdown signatures, we used iLINCS to perform unsupervised clustering of the top 50 differentially expressed L1000 genes from our 6 seed gene knockdown signatures (maximum of 300 L1000 genes) (Figure 3 and Figure 4 ). Due to gene overlap between top 50 differentially expressed L1000 genes in seed gene knockdown signatures, this resulted in the clustering of expression data for 260 L1000 genes. To generate this heatmap, we used the interactive ""gene The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint clusters"" function in iLINCS to cluster expression data from 260 differentially expressed genes using Pearson correlation coefficients (""union of the top 50 differentially expressed genes"").Using the y-axis dendrogram function, we then selected genes that displayed similar changes in expression across the signatures. We refer to genes that are upregulated across all signatures as ""panels of clustered upregulated genes"" and genes that are downregulated across all signatures as ""panels of clustered downregulated genes."" Panels of clustered upregulated and panels of clustered downregulated gene groups were selected separately and the data was exported to Excel (Table S3, Figure 3 and Figure 4 ). These clustered gene panels (Table S3) were carried forward to two separate Enrichr analyses.

Enrichr analyses of panels of clustered upregulated genes

We performed Enrichr analyses on panels of clustered upregulated genes from our iLINCS clustering analysis. Top cell signaling pathways included forkhead box O (FOXO), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Wnt signaling pathways ( Figure S4 ). These pathways often interact and all have important roles in cell metabolism, inflammation, cellular proliferation, oxidative stress prevention, and apoptosis (62) (63) (64) (65) . Analysis of gene ontology (GO) cellular components for our panels of clustered upregulated genes included several microtubule and cytoskeletal components ( Figure S5 ), while the top hits for GO molecular function included protein kinase C (PKC) and MAPK binding ( Figure S6 ). Our protein-protein interactions analysis ( Figure S7 ) yielded multiple hits for protein kinases such as RPS6KA3, MAPK14, GSK3B, and CDK1. We also found hits for proteins involved in protein degradation and protein ubiquitination (CUL1 and SKP1), chromatin remodeling (PCNA and HDAC1), and an estrogen receptor (ESR1).We next probed for kinases that when knocked down in various cell lines, have upregulated genes similar to the panels of clustered upregulated genes from our iLINCS clustering analysis. Top hits included several serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, MAP2K2, PTK2, ATR) as well as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in energy homeostasis (NMUR2, FFAR1) ( Figure S8 ). We next probed for transcription factors that had occupancy sites for our panels of clustered upregulated genes. We found several transcription factors that play important roles in developmental processes, such as WT1, TRIM28, NFIB, NUCKS1, and TCF3 ( Figure S9 ). Finally, our database of genotypes and phenotypes (dbGaP) analysis implicates diabetes as the most relevant phenotype ( Figure S10 ). A summary of these findings can be found in Table 3 .

Enrichr analyses of panels of clustered downregulated genes

We performed Enrichr analyses on our panels of clustered downregulated genes from our iLINCS clustering analysis. Top cell signaling pathways include pathways relevant to immune/inflammatory responses and cell cycle regulation ( Figure S11 ). The top 5 hits in our GO cellular components analysis for our panels of clustered downregulated genes implicated mitochondrial function ( Figure S12 ), while the top hits for GO molecular function included several RNA polymerase promotors/activators ( Figure S13 ). Our protein-protein interactions analysis ( Figure S14 ) yielded multiple hits for chromatin remodeling proteins (PCNA, HDAC1, HDAC2, CREBBP). We also found hits for proteins involved in immunity/cell cycle regulation (NFKB2, CSNK2A1, MYC), and ubiquitination (BRCA1).We next probed for kinases that when knocked down in various cell lines, have downregulated genes similar to our panels of clustered downregulated genes from our iLINCS clustering analysis. Top hits included several kinases involved in fatty acid metabolism and energy homeostasis (RXRA, PPARG, PXK), cellular growth (RYK, WEE1, ABL2), GPCRs (GPR37, LPHN1), and a glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) ( Figure S15 ). We next probed for transcription factors that had occupancy sites for our panels of clustered downregulated genes. We found several transcription factors that play important roles in cell proliferation (MYCN, MYC, E2F1, E2F4, FOXM1), development (NUCKS1, POU5F1) , and erythroid function (EKLF) ( Figure S16 ). Finally, our dbGaP analysis implicates carcinoma, memory, and Grave's Disease as the most relevant phenotypes ( Figure S17 ). A summary of these findings can be found in Table 3 .

iLINCS connectivity analyses (drug discovery)

Using the connected signatures function in iLINCS, we identified chemical perturbagens that produce L1000 signatures that are highly discordant (anti-correlated) with our seed gene Next, we combined all discordant perturbagens from Table S4 and reported the top 20 overall discordant perturbagen signatures across all seed gene knockdown signatures (Table   S5 ). After removing duplicate hits, 12 unique perturbagens remained (Table 4 ). Hits included PPARγ agonists (troglitazone and genistein), valproic acid (a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker and HDAC inhibitor), typical antipsychotic drugs (trifluoperazine, thioridazine, and fluphenazine), and two PI3K inhibitors (Wortmannin and LY-294002). We selected the FDA approved PPARγ agonist pioglitazone for preclinical trials due to its ability to regulate glycolytic pathways that are abnormal in schizophrenia, as well as evidence that pioglitazone treatment improves negative symptoms in patients (cognition has not been studied) (54, 66) .We divided the top 12 unique perturbagens from our signature connectivity analysis into 5 groups: PPAR agonists, PI3K inhibitors, antipsychotic drugs, HDAC inhibitors, and other (Table 4 ). PI3K inhibitors constituted 2 of the drugs that may ""reverse"" our disease signature. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint These antitumor drugs inhibit PI3K enzymes, which are part of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and play critical roles in many cellular functions such as cellular proliferation, metabolism, and immune cell activation (93) (94) (95) . Recent work has linked schizophrenia pathology to the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling cascade (74, 96, 97) . Additionally, PI3K signaling can modulate synaptic formation and plasticity, and has been implicated in both schizophrenia and autism disorder (reviewed in (98, 99) ). Previous work demonstrated pharmacological inhibition of the catalytic subunit of PI3K blocks amphetamine induced psychosis in mice, highlighting PI3K inhibitors as therapeutic targets for the treatment of psychiatric disorders (100) . However, PI3K inhibition may be more suitable for ""positive symptoms,"" as PI3K inhibition results in diminished insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by inhibiting translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane (101) . Three of our drug discovery analysis hits were typical antipsychotics, which also treat positive symptoms of schizophrenia via dopamine receptor D2 antagonism (102) . It is possible that the glycolytic knockdown signatures used to generate these perturbagens could cause transcriptional changes in L1000 genes involved in the regulation of dopaminergic synapses, suggesting dopamine and metabolic systems could be connected in schizophrenia. This is not entirely surprising as antipsychotics have well documented metabolic effects (103) .The top unique perturbagen in our signature connectivity analysis (Table 4 ) was valproic acid, an HDAC inhibitor that modulates sodium channels and enhances gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission (traditionally used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder) (104) . Interestingly, sodium valproate (valproic acid) is commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of schizophrenia, and a recent 4 week randomized clinical trial demonstrated improvement in psychopathology with a combination therapy of valproate and risperidone or olanzapine compared to antipsychotics alone (n=249) (105) . There is also some evidence for positive effects on aggression and tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenia, although sample sizes are small (106) . Valproic acid also affects ERK and Wnt pathways, which were .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint implicated in our pathway analyses and regulate cell survival and cytoskeletal modifications (107) . Stimulation of ERK1/2 has the ability to enhance the transcriptional activity of PPARs and increase glucose metabolism, indicating PPAR agonists might also be potential therapeutic targets (108) . Interestingly, two of our unique perturbagen hits included PPAR agonists (troglitazone and Genistein) (109) . Troglitazone, part of the TZD family, is an anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic drug developed to treat type 2 diabetes. Troglitazone is a ligand to both PPARα and (more strongly) PPARγ, promotes glucose uptake by increasing two transporters we previously found decreased in pyramidal neurons in schizophrenia (GLUT1 and GLUT3), and inhibits the pro-inflammatory factor NFKB (implicated in our Enrichr analyses) (18, 54, 110, 111) .The TZD family of PPAR agonists present an interesting therapeutic intervention for studies in preclinical models of schizophrenia due to their ability to modulate glucose systems we find abnormal in schizophrenia (112, 113) . Pioglitazone, a current FDA approved member of the TZD family, also stimulates glycolytic systems and can attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction, reverse memory impairment, and decrease the incidence of dementia (48, (113) (114) (115) (116) (117) (118) (119) . Thus, pioglitazone is an easily accessible drug candidate to ""reverse"" pathology and possibly restore cognitive defects related to schizophrenia.To test this hypothesis, we first examined metabolic pathways in the GluN1 knockdown model of schizophrenia. GluN1 knockdown animals display a wide variety of endophenotypes associated with schizophrenia, including deficits in cognition (40) . We found that top pathways associated with protein changes at the synapse in GluN1 knockdown mice compared to WT controls were metabolic in nature ( Figure 5B ). Additionally, expression of glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3) were significantly decreased in the frontal cortex of GluN1 knockdown mice ( Figure 5C ). These results suggest there are similar abnormalities in bioenergetic systems in this model to schizophrenia, and that modulating these systems are viable treatment strategies. Thus, we examined the effects of pioglitazone, a PPAR agonist that increases glucose uptake, on behavioral endpoints in the GluN1 knockdown model. Pharmacological The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint manipulation of glycolytic pathways via pioglitazone could stimulate glucose uptake and metabolism, possibly restoring some behavioral deficits. We are also able to control for medication treatments, which can be difficult to interpret in human studies. It is important to distinguish significant metabolic changes as underlying features of the illness and not epiphenomena related to treatment with antipsychotics.We hypothesized that pioglitazone treatment would improve cognitive function in the GluN1 knockdown model. The puzzle box assay examines cognitive function and is progressively more difficult, evident in the similarly poor performance by all groups in later trials.However, in all earlier trials (where GluN1 deficit is more robust), pioglitazone tended to increase WT mean latencies while decreasing GluN1 knockdown mean latencies. Our statistical analyses found that in Trial 1 and Trial 4, pioglitazone significantly decreased the latency to perform the task in GluN1 knockdown mice ( Figure 6 , panels C and D). This suggests that in normal physiology, pioglitazone could have a negative effect on learning, while in a pathological brain with impaired synapses, pioglitazone may have restorative effects on cognition.We also examined the effects of pioglitazone on behaviors reflecting positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms. In line with published findings for this model (39) , our data suggest that GluN1 knockdown animals have increased locomotor activity and stereotypy compared to WT littermate controls, as well as increased mania and anti-anxiety like behavior (increased % time spent in open arms in EPM compared to WT mice) (Figures 7 and S19 ).Pioglitazone did not have an effect on these behaviors regardless of genotype, suggesting that either glucose metabolism does not play a role in this phenotype of GluN1 knockdown mice or that this is a neurodevelopmental phenotype that requires earlier intervention.We did not detect any changes in sociability between any groups. All groups choose to spend more time in the social zone ( Figure S20 ). Previous studies demonstrate inherent social abnormalities in GluN1 knockdown mice, suggesting our experiment may be underpowered to detect an effect of sociability (39) . We also did not detect any changes in social novelty- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint however our social novelty data has high variability, which could contribute to lack of significant findings.Finally, we assessed sensorimotor gating using pre-pulse inhibition and acoustic startle response (Figure 8 Our findings suggest that pioglitazone may selectively exert its effects on specific endophenotypes of schizophrenia, suggesting circuit-specific modulation of neuroplastic substrates. One possibility is that pioglitazone improves the function of brain regions and circuits that are hypometabolic, while having no effect/negative consequences on brain regions that are normal or hypermetabolic. Many behavioral endpoints that are markers of ""positive symptoms"" of schizophrenia could correspond to ""hypermetabolic"" circuitry, and thus not be amenable to rescue via pioglitazone. We found pioglitazone had no effect on behavioral deficits such as hyperactivity, increased stereotypy, and social impairments, which are normalized by typical and atypical antipsychotics in GluN1 knockdown animals (39, 41, (120) (121) (122) (123) . However, pioglitazone did have a restorative effect on cognition (puzzle box assay), while typical antipsychotics do not .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint (7, 124) . Studies examining the effects of antipsychotic treatment on cognition in GluN1 knockdown animals has not yet been done and are warranted.Cognition includes several subprocesses, not all of which are uniquely sustained by the frontal cortex, but also by distributed cortical networks including frontal regions which may not be associated with the frontal lobes (125, 126) . These processes can include task management, planning, flexibility of behavior and thought, working memory, attention, or others. Thus, poor performance in any of these parameters could reflect a number of possible cognitive mechanisms (125, 127) . For instance, two meta-analyses of cannabis use on cognition in schizophrenia demonstrated cannabis improved certain subtasks for elements of cognition (visual memory, planning, working memory) while having no effect or worsening other tasks (attention, verbal memory, processing speed) (128, 129) . It is also possible that pioglitazone may only improve a metabolic subtype of schizophrenia. This is supported by our LCMS and qPCR studies in GluN1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/338392 doi: bioRxiv preprint Our findings also justify future pioglitazone studies examining different types of memory.For example, pioglitazone may independently influence associative learning, spatial or working memory, cognitive flexibility, long-term memory, or recognition memory. Pioglitazone is also an FDA approved drug, and further human trials examining pioglitazone, antipsychotic treatment, and a larger number of specific cognitive aspects would be useful. This could be achieved through measures such as the Stroop word-color task (selective attention), n back test and backward digit span tests (working memory), Brown-Peterson test (memory capacity), or Wisconsin card sorting (planning and set-shifting) (125, 130) . Other indices of cognition such as the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), the Perceptual Organizational Index (POI), the Working Memory Index (WMI), the Processing Speed Index (PSI), the Immediate Memory Index (IMI) and the General Memory Index are useful in human cognitive battery (125) . In summary, these data suggest that pioglitazone may impact specific elements of cognition in models of schizophrenia..

"Abstract

Background: Imagery techniques have been used as essential parts of diagnostic workup for patients suspected for 2019-nCoV infection, Multiple studies have reported the features of chest computed tomography (CT) scans among a number of 2019-nCoV patients. Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I 2 -statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result.Results: According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively.Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation was seen in 86% but 14% had NO GGO or consolidation.The other rare CT symptoms were pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion with 4, 5, 7% prevalence, respectively. The most prevalent event was Either GGO or consolidation in 85% of patients.

","

The results based on clinical and CT-scan symptoms are presented in table.1. According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively. The rare CT-scan symptoms were lymphadenopathy (LAP), pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion with 4, 5, 7% prevalence, respectively. Bilateral involvement of lung was observed in 82% of patients studies with 83 sample size in which GGO without consolidation was more prevalent (72%) than the other one.

Publication bias:

The funnel plots for the meta-analysis of the prevalence of different symptoms in Corona patients were not shown. The plots were symmetrical on visual inspection, indicating low risk of publication bias in most of status. The Egger's regression tests also demonstrated in Table. 1.For studies with high risk of publication the adjusted trim and fill statistics were presents in table.1

Any discrepancy will be resolved by consensus or consultation with a third review author (RK). All studies had the high score in judgment.According to rapid spread of new corona virus 2019 in the world (reported in 86 countries as of March 5, 2020), it is crucial to stablish robust clinical data to help health care providers control the outbreak (17). Early diagnosis of 2019-nCoV can lead to patient isolation strategies which in turn leads to reduction of viral transition. The epidemiological history may be vague and the sign and symptoms of the disease may resemble other viral infections. The RT-PCR tests of serum or respiratory specimens may be unavailable for all suspected patients as well.There is the possibility of initial false negative results of RT-PCR tests due to lack of replicable nucleic acid or technical errors as well (18). In this context, chest CT images are important elements of clinical workflow of 2019-nCoV, with respect to screening, diagnosis and followup. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to find the answer for this question that whether there is any fix pattern of pulmonary involvement in chest CT scans of patients with 2019-nCoV infection according to available evidence.Our pooled data revealed that the most common patterns of CT scan in infected patients were Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), interlobular septal thickening and consolidation (presented in 79%, 66% and 40% of cases respectively) especially in bilateral lower lobes of lung (reported in 38% of patients). Right middle lobe, right upper lobe and left upper lobe are involved less than lower lobes (26%, 15% and 3% respectively). The patterns of lesions are mostly bilateral (82%) and peripheral (56%). Crazy paving pattern, LAP, pericardial and pleural effusion and sub-pleural signs were the other CT scan findings accordingly (6, 19, 20) . However there are positive RT-PCR cases with normal pattern of chest CT scan suggesting not to exclude these patients of 2019-nCoV (21) .All rights reserved.

Bilateral peripheral ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities were found in CT scans of 21 patients from China. In this study, 15 cases (71%) had the involvement of more than 2 lobes. Also pulmonary nodules, cavitation, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent in the cases (5). Another study among 6 patients with confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV in China revealed multifocal or unifocal involvement of ground-glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation and fibrosis as basic pattern. In this study pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were absent as well. Also the lesions generally progressed in follow-up CT scans obtained between 2 to 6 days after initial images (22) .It is worthwhile to consider the dynamic nature of chest CT findings of 2019-nCoV, i.e., the alteration of finings that may be observed in repeated measures. In a study among 21 nonrespiratory compromised patients with 2019-nCoV, multiple CT images were performed in the process of recovery. The authors classified 4 radiologic stages. In stage 1 (0-4 days after onset of disease), GGO in the lower lobes was the main finding. In stage 2 (5-8 days after the onset) the infection extended and diffuse GGO, crazy-paving pattern and consolidation were observed. In stage 3 (9-13 days after the onset, peak stage), the consolidation was the dominant abnormality and finally in sage 4 (≥14 days after the onset, absorption stage), consolidation was absorbed. There was no crazy-paving pattern but still a remarkable GGO abnormality in this stage. Furthermore, in this study, GGO and peripheral distribution were dominant (more than 50% of patients) in all 4 stages. Also, bilateral multilobe involvement was dominant in stages 2, 3 and 4.

"Abstract

Most models of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States do not consider geographic variation, and their relevance to public policies is not straightforward. We developed a mathematical model that characterizes infections by state and incorporates inflows and outflows of interstate travelers. Modeling reveals that curbing interstate travel when the disease is already widespread will make little difference. Meanwhile, increased testing capacity (facilitating early identification of infected people and quick isolation) and strict social-distancing and self-quarantine rules are effective in abating the outbreak. The modeling has also produced state-specific information. For example, for New York and Michigan, isolation of persons exposed to the virus needs to be imposed within 2 days to prevent a broad outbreak, whereas for other states this period can be 3.6 days. This model could be used to determine resources needed before safely lifting state policies on social distancing.

","Introduction

The Coronavirus disease is an ongoing pandemic that poses a global threat. As of March 26, 2020, more than 520,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 200 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 23,500 deaths (9-12, 24, 26, 28, 35, 40) . In the United States, the first known positive case was identified in Washington state on January 20, 2020 (18) . By March 26, the epidemic had been rapidly spreading across many communities and present in all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia; the number of confirmed cases in the United States rose to 78,786 with 1,137 deaths.To combat the spread of COVID-19, the government has taken actions in various dimensions, including banning or discouraging domestic and international travels, announcing stay-at-home orders to curb non-essential interactions for reducing transmission rate, and urging commercial laboratories to increase test capacity. To curb traveling, on January 31, the United States government announced travel restrictions on travelers from China; on February 29, it announced travel ban against Iran and advised travel with caution to Europe (1) ; on March 11,  it announced travel restrictions on most of European countries. To reduce human-interactions, on March 13, a national emergency was declared; as of March 28, 39 states had issued either statewide or regionally stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order, requiring residents to stay indoors except for essential activities. To increase test capacities, on February 4, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s test, which was later to be proved inconclusive (2); on February 29, the FDA relaxed its rules for some laboratories, allowing them to start testing before the agency granting its approvals; on March 27, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization to a medical device maker, the Abbott Labs, for the use of a coronavirus test that delivers quick testing results (3).2 .

Works on evaluating similar measures in other countries, especially China, started to emerge (14, 24) . For example, the effect of travel restriction on delaying the virus spread in China has been reported (9, 36) . However, it is still unclear what control and intervention measures would have actual effect, and to what extent, on abating the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. As the United States has very different political, administrative, social, pubic health and medical systems, as well as culture from China, this remains to be a critical question to address, especially considering that some measures and policies come with extremely high economic and societal costs.There have been numerous modeling works projecting or predicting the trend of the COVID-19 pandemic regionally or globally (16, 21) . Most of the works apply a global model to the entire study area, either a region, a country, or the entire globe. Rarely the variation of different parts within one area and the interactions among those parts are taken into consideration.However, a country like the United States features diversity in all aspects. On the one hand, the overall situation of the entire country is a result emerging from local situations and their interactions, and thus, ignoring the local interactions can hardly lead to a high-quality overall model; on the other hand, as all interventions and policies finally have to be adapted to the local situation, a localized modeling will be much more relevant to the real-world practices.Spatially and network-related epidemic models can describe the geographical spread of viral dynamics (24, 27, 30, 37) . Recent studies have shown the importance of incorporating timely human mobility patterns derived from mobile phone big data and global flight networks into the epidemiology modeling process and in public health studies (7-9, 15, 20, 22, 24, 29, 33, 41, 42) .Without accurate models that incorporate human mobility patterns and spatial interactions (8, 42) , it is rather challenging to quantify the sensitivity of parameters, and using the linkage to real practices to make sensible policy suggestions.

First, to localize the modeling, we developed a mathematical compartmental model system that simultaneously characterizes the spatiotemporal dynamics of infections in 51 areas (50 states and the District of Columbia). Each state or district has its own model, and all models simultaneously take into account inflows and outflows of interstate travelers. Second, to improve the practical relevance, we chose to use three parameters that can directly correspond to possible practical means to discover, combat, and control the spread of the disease, and quantify their impact on the final output of the model. The three parameters include: 1) the transmission rate b, which corresponds to the local socialdistancing enforcement, e.g., the stay-home order; 2) the detection and reporting rate r, which corresponds to the testing capacity; and 3) the travel ratio α t , which corresponds to the ratio of interstate travel volume compared to that of 2019 during the same period.The modeling is a dynamic projection process. We employed daily and state-specific historical data to incrementally calibrate the model, and then used the calibrated model to predict future scenarios under different control and intervention measures. During this process, we ran data assimilation methods to identify parameter values that optimally fit the current situation (see more details in the supplementary material). To project into the future, we set different values for the parameters to create different control and intervention scenarios, and then ran the simulation to see their impact on the model results. The final output of the model is the total number of confirmed cases in a state on a particular day.The current strategy in the United States is to isolate people who have the symptoms of COVID-19. An ideal scenario is to have an 100% reporting rate, i.e., every infected case gets confirmed and thus isolated quickly. Another ideal setting is to have everyone who was in contact with the infected gets identified and isolated quickly as well. Our model incorporated these considerations and examined such direct isolation of the exposed compartment in detail.We particularly investigated the impact of quickness of such actions through mathematical 4 .

This can be explained by that when the disease has already widespread in all states, the relatively small number of cases in the travelers will cause little difference to the local situation, compared with the effects of local social-distancing and isolation rules and the increase of testing capacity.

Methods

The mathematical model that simulates the spatiotemporal dynamics of state-level infections in the United States is a modified compartmental model in epidemiology by taking into account the variation of the 51 administrative units and their interactions (6, 17, 19) . It consists of 51 ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems, with each one characterizing the evolution of susceptible (S), exposed (E), reported (I), unreported (A) and resolved (R) cases per state (see more details in the supplementary material and also Fig. S1 ). The 51 ODE systems are then coupled through the state-to-state travel network flows (see Fig. S2 ) that were extracted from the aggregated SafeGraph mobility data and weighted by α t (25, 31) . Unlike most other models, we also incorporate the potential asymptomatic transmission. This makes the derivation of the basic reproduction number R 0 different. Besides, each ODE system also includes two unknown parameters: the transmission rate (b) and the report rate for each state (r). The unknown parameters are inferred based on the number of confirmed cases in each state for the period of March 1-March 20, 2020. The source of infection case data is (10) .The COVID-19 transmission dynamics (the ODE system) was simulated using the Forward Euler method, with each day discretized into 24 smaller time periods to ensure the numerical stability (see Fig. S3 ). The parameter fitting was conducted under the Bayesian formulation that combines the effect of the underlying dynamics governed by the ODE system, serving as 5 .

For this classical data assimilation problem, we employed the Ensemble Kalman Filter method that was derived from the Kalman filter and tailored to deal with problems with high-dimensional state variables (13, 32) . The method proves to be effective when the measuring operator is linear and the underlying dynamics is Gaussian-like. It has been applied to a vast of problems that do not strictly satisfy the Gaussianity requirement. To apply this method, we generated 2000 samples according to the prior distribution, and evolve the samples through the dynamics of the ODE system. The samples were then rectified at the end of each day, using the announced number of confirmed cases, for tuning the two unknown parameters b and r.At the beginning of the simulation, March 1st, only a few states had non-zero confirmed cases. The true numbers of exposed people and unreported cases on that day, however, are unknown. These two numbers are also the state variables that need to be inferred to using the collected data. On March 1, we put a non-informative prior with range [0, 500] and For forecasting, we performed scenario studies of two types. First, we ran the mathematical model by applying the initial data obtained as of March 20 into the future for the next 40 days, but with different configurations of (b, r, α t ). The simulation results out of this setting were then compared with those from the setting that the three parameters remained unchanged for each state. To quantify and visualize the difference, we compared the increase of the percentage of 6 .

We built a new mathematical model that incorporated such isolations to study the effect of them. A new quarantined compartment (Q) was introduced into the model. Through the simulation, we examined the correlation between the average action-taking time (i.e., temporal lag in putting a person into quarantine denoted by D q ) and the increase of non-infected population. In both scenario studies, the simulation was run with the Forward Euler ODE solver, during which each day was divided into 24 intervals to achieve a numerical stability.

Findings

The interstate travel in the United States has been rapidly dropping recently (39) , which is going to have a tremendous impact on the country's economy and society. However, this study finds that the mitigation effect that this change can bring about by itself, regarding abating the COVID-19 spread, is very limited as the outbreak has already widespread in all states. On the other hand, our modeling indicates that lowering the transmission rate and the unreported-case rate would have a great effect on abating the infection. Mapped to the public policy, this means that curbing the interstates travel alone is not going to reduce the spread of COVID-19, while the policies such as ordering stay-at-home and social distancing that reduces human interaction and increasing the testing capacities of all clinics around the nation could significantly decrease the total number of infections. While we did not conduct a rigorous economic analysis in this study, it seems reasonable to assume that producing more testing kits and conducting more tests will be significantly less expensive than completely shutting off business and curbing travels. result. By decreasing α r from 1 to 0, we increase the report rate from the original r 0 to 1, and by decreasing α b we decrease the transmission rate. Most states, except a few such as NY, MI, and CA, see drastic improvement when the transmission rate is decreased and the testing(reporting) rate is increased, but the reduction of interstate traffic alone is not as effective. Our modelling reveals that once the epidemic in an area has reached a certain stage, the difference that can be caused to the local situation by the relatively small number of imported cases due to the interstate travel is insignificant. According to our modeling, all states in the United States have reached that stage. Therefore, as long as those travelers follow the social-distancing rules and the local government provides sufficient testing capacity, there is no apparent urge to curb interstate travel. This is in line with the finding in (20, 36) CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052720 doi: medRxiv preprint as of March 20, 2020, with α r = α b = 1, in which most states will continue their exponential growth before reaching their peak; (B) with α r = α b = 0.1, that is, when the transmission rate b is much smaller and the reported rate r is much higher (closer to 1), we can ""flatten the curve"" on the virus.We further investigate the effect of increased testing capacity and report rate. As shown in Figure 3a , most states see drastic improvement when the report rate increases. All states, by April 29, see monotonically exponential reduction of infections. The impact is strong in states such as MA, AZ, FL, and OR, but relatively weak in states such as NY, MI and IL. In Figure 3b , we study the effect of α r and α b on the basic reproduction rate R e in NY (see other states in Fig. S15 ). It can be seen that merely raising the report rate cannot fully make R e < 1.To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in these states, a proactive approach needs to be taken, and quick detection and isolation of the exposed population need to be in place instead of being delayed until the onset of the symptoms. This measure can prevent the exposed population from potentially infecting other susceptible people. In Figure 3c , we plot the increase of infections in terms of D q (i.e., the temporal lag in putting a person into quarantine) for the states that are sensitive to change of D q , including NY, NJ, IL, GA, MI, CO, WI, LA, TX, PA, MA, and TN. The longer one waits to inform and isolate the exposed population, the more infection one observes. For example, there is a sharp transition for NY and MI. If the average detection and isolation time is more than 2 days, the number of infections will significantly increase.The results again showed the importance of sufficient testing and strong transmissionintervention measures such as self-quarantine and stay-at-home policy (38) . These policies can help quickly identify the source of infection and isolate them before they infect the remaining population. This measure presumably comes with a lower economical cost.

Discussion

Modeling and analyzing the spread of COVID-19, and assessing the effect of various policies could be instrumental to national and international agencies for health response planning (9, 14, 21, 28, 36, 38) . We show that the effect of interstate travel reduction is at most modest in the United States when the outbreak has already widespread in all states. On the other hand, we need to impose strong transmission-reduction intervention and increased testing capacity and report rate to contain the spread of virus. The result is in agreement with previous findings (9, 12, 14, 23, 36, 40) , suggesting that the effect of travel ban at a later stage of the outbreak is rather modest. This is also in line with the fact that the outbreaks still occurred in Europe even upon the strong travel ban on the earlier epicenter of Wuhan and its surrounding cities in China. We also show that the transmission-reduction intervention such as policies on the social-distancing and shelter-in-place rules, and the increase of testing rate, which facilitates immediate isolation upon exposure, will significantly reduce the total infected population. Such effect is mostly visible for the states of NY, NJ, MI, and IL. Particularly, our modeling results showed that for states such as NY and MI, to achieve an optimal infection reduction, a more proactive approach needs to be taken to quickly identify the exposed population and isolate them within two days of exposure in order to ensure the infection reduction. The result is in agreement with previous findings (24, 28) .We do need to emphasize that the model itself does not distinguish different ways of traveling across states. Indeed, if the interstate travel is conducted mostly through transiting through busy airports and train stations, and the social-distancing policy is not strictly imposed, then the high population density at these places will bring up the transmission rate b locally in space and time, leading to a higher infection rate. This is a severe consequence, but it should not be counted as the direct result of relaxing travel restrictions.

"Abstract

After the outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide in 2012.Currently, a novel human coronavirus has caused a major disease outbreak, and named corona virus disease 2019 . The emergency of MRES-COV and COVID-19 has caused global panic and threatened health security. Unfortunately, the similarities and differences between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore, is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and CochraneRegister of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or MERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared with COVID-19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication. The most effective drug for MERS-COV is ribavirin and interferon.

Studies were excluded as following criteria: duplicate publications, case report, meta-analysis, letter, review, technology report, commentary, animal trial, correspondence, predictive study, guidence, radiograph study and meeting report.

Study Selection

At the beginning, 4743 potential publications were identified. We removed 678 duplicates and reviewed the titles and abstracts of remaining 4065 publications. 4015 publications were excluded for following reasons: not involved research point (n = 1378), review (n = 569), no English (n = 33), case report (n = 316), meta-analysis (n = 1), letter (n = 127), technology report (n = 196), commentaries (n = 61), animal study (n = 1107), correspondence (n = 29), predictive study (n = 110), guidence (n = 28), meeting report ( n = 16) and radiograph (n = 44). Then, a comprehensive review of full-text was conducted for remaining 50 publications. Two reviewers independently screened eligible literature, and any argument was solved by discussion with a third reviewer. Finally, thirty-two studies were included in this study . The process was shown in Figure 1 .

Data Extraction

Two reviewers extracted independently common, clinical and laboratory characteristics of included studies, with disagreements were solved by discussion with a third reviewer. The extracted data included incubation time, white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte count, creactive protein (CRP), alamine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), .

For normality distribution data, outcomes were extracted directly. For skewness distribution data, the outcomes was extracted after being converted as specific formula [40] .

Quality Assessment

The quality assessment of included studies was performed through the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS), as recommended by the Cochrane Non-RandomizedStudies [41] . The NOS includes three parts for risk of bias, with nine points in total: (1) selection of research groups (four points); (2) inter-group comparability (two points); and (3) ascertainment of exposure and outcomes (three points) for case-control and cohort studies, respectively. Study that scored 6 or more was qualified for systematic review [42] . The assessment process was completed by two reviewers independently. All debates were solved by discussion with a third reviewer.Among thirty-two included studies, four studies obtained 6 points of NOS [26, 28, 32, 35] , and remaining twenty-eight studies obtained 7 points of NOS or more [8-25, 27, 29-31, 33-34, 36-39] . The result of quality assessment was presented in Table 3 .

Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses and graphs were generated and plotted using GraphPad Prism version 7.00 software (GraphPad Software Inc). The p value < 0.05 suggests significant difference.

Study Characteristics

All included studies were retrospective study . Among ten studies reported COVID-19, one trial was performed in Netherlands [12] and remaining nine trials were conducted in China [8-9, 13-16, 37-39] .

Incidence of ICU Admission, Discharge and Fatality

The higher admission rate of ICU was found in MERS-COV population than in COVID-19 population ( 43.6% vs. 22.4%, Figure 2 ). There was a higher discharge rate in MERS-COV populations compared with COVID-19 population ( 59.9% vs. 33.5%, Figure 3 ). The lower fatality rate was found in COVID-19 population compared with MERS-COV population (6.8% vs. 34.1%, Figure 4 ). 

Discussion

Coronavirus is an important pathogen causing respiratory and intestinal infection. Of seven identified coronaviruses, the two very pathogenic viruses, SARS-COV and MERS-COV, cause severe ARDS and even acute respiratory failure. With a mortality rate of more than 10% and more than 35% respectively [43] [44] . The four other human coronaviruses In addition, we found that the number of males is more than that of females in either COVID-19 or MERS-COV population. The possible reason of reduced susceptibility of females to viral infection is that females have a lot of X chromosome and estrogen that are vital components in development of innate and adaptive immunity [47] . Meanwhile, numbers of patients with COVID-19 infection had chronic comorbidities, mainly hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which is similar to MERS-COV population. Those results indicate that older adult males with chronic underlying disease might be more susceptibility to COVID-19 or MERS-COV.. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.08.20032821 doi: medRxiv preprint 1 1 In terms of laboratory testing, reduced lymphocytes and increased CRP were found in both COVID-19 and MERS-COV patients. This result indicates that COVID-19 might be associated with cellular immune response, mainly act on lymphocytes like MERS-COV does [48] . The cells infected by viruses induce the release of numbers of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation storm in the body. Moreover, increased cytokines might make damage to related organs such as liver [49] . Our results demonstrated that abnormal value of AST was found in MERS-COV population, but not in COVID-19 population. The possible reason is that the follow-up time of COVID-19 population was too short, and the liver might remain to be in compensatory stage. For this result, a long follow-up time study is urgently needed. On the other hand, our results suggested that MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission and fatality than COVID-19 population, indicating that compared with MERS-COV, COVID-19 has less toxic and more easily cured. However, lower discharge rate was found in COVID population than in MERS-COV population. The possible explanation is that most of COVID-19 patients remained to be hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission, and data on those patients could not be obtained in time. Thus, careful interpretation is urged for this result.Up to now, no effective strategy has been found for treatment of COVID-19 infection [50] . Currently, the measure to COVID-19 is to control the source of the infection; taking personal protective works to reduce the risk of transmission; and early diagnosing, isolating and supportive treating for confirmed patients. In the present study, our systematic results of cure rate of drug for MERS-COV infection indicated that ribavirin and interferon, oseltamivir, antivirals and intravenous immunoglobulin all had been effective for MERS-COV infection, with the cure rate of those drugs was 74.2%, 69.2%, 67.1% and 62.5% respectively. Thus, we . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.08.20032821 doi: medRxiv preprint 1 2 assume that those drugs might also be effective at COVID-19 infection. However, further studies are needed to confirm this idea.This study has several limitations. First, many patients infected by COVID-19 remained to be hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission, leading to the unavailable of some data. Second, the follow-up time of COVID-19 population is too short to get related data from long-term observations of this disease. Third, finding of statistical tests and p values between COVID-19 and MERS-COV populations should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, the number of MERS-COV patients treated by drugs is small, careful understanding is needed for the cure rate of drug for this disease. Finally, as COVID-19 is still developing around the world and remains to have many unknowns, the results of this study are staged and need to be carefully understood. More large-sample, multicentre, high-quality research should be performed to update this study.

Conclusion

Our systematic review reveals that main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV populations are fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia. ARDS is main complication of both two populations. COVID-19 population has a shorter incubation time and lower rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality compared with MRES-COV population.

"Abstract

The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify infection protection and control recommendations from published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers.

","INTRODUCTION Purpose and Research Questions

The Infection Prevention & Control of the World Health Organization (WHO) Health Emergency Programme presented a query on preventing and managing COVID-19 in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care facilities including privately paid for and publicly paid for settings with a 5-business day timeline. According to the WHO, ""long-term care covers those activities undertaken by others to ensure that people with, or at risk of, a significant ongoing loss of intrinsic capacity can maintain a level of functional ability consistent with their basic rights, fundamental freedoms and human dignity"" (https://www.who.int/ageing/long-term-care/WHO-LTC-series-subsaharan-africa.pdf?ua=1). Examples of long-term care include nursing homes, charitable homes, municipal homes, long-term care hospitals, long-term care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, convalescent homes, and assisted living facilities (https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/home-continuing-care/long-term-facilitiesbased-care.html).The overall objective of this rapid review of clinical practice guidelines was to identify infection protection and control measures for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings. In order to focus the research question to increase feasibility, we proposed the following key research questions:1. What are the infection prevention and control practices/measures for preventing or reducing respiratory viruses (including coronavirus and influenza) in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care? 2. How do infection prevention and control practices differ for adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care with respiratory illness and severe comorbidities or frailty differ than those without such severe comorbidities/frailty? 3. How do infection prevention and control practices differ for adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care with respiratory illness from low-and middle-income economy countries (LMIC) differ than those living in high-income economy countries and do differences exist across different cultural contexts?

METHODS

The rapid review conduct was guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 1 along with the Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research 2 . The team used an integrated knowledge translation approach, with consultation from the knowledge users from the WHO at the following stages: question development, interpretation of results, and draft report. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement 3 to guide the reporting of our rapid review results; a PRISMA extension for rapid reviews is currently under development. This rapid review of guidelines was completed in conjunction with a rapid overview of systematic reviews published in a separate report titled: Preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid overview of reviews"".6Other: No other restrictions were imposed.

Study selection

For both level 1 (title/abstract) and level 2 (full-text) screening, a screening form was prepared based on the eligibility criteria and pilot-tested by the review team using 25 citations prior to level 1 screening and 5 full text articles prior to level 2 screening. Agreement between reviewers was sufficiently high (>75%) in both cases so no further pilot-testing was required. Full screening was completed by a single reviewer for both level 1 and level 2 using Synthesi.SR, the team's proprietary online software (https://breakthroughkt.ca/login.php).

Data items and data abstraction

Items for data abstraction included guideline scope, target audience, guideline development methods, recommendations, and level of evidence for reach recommendation. A standardized data abstraction form was developed. Prior to data abstraction, a calibration exercise was completed by 2 team members independently. Following successful completion of the calibration exercise, included guidelines were abstracted by single reviewers.

Quality appraisal

Quality appraisal was carried out using the AGREE-2 tool (https://www.agreetrust.org/resourcecentre/agree-reporting-checklist/) for clinical practice guidelines. The AGREE-2 tool includes 23 items that are categorized according to the following six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence.

Synthesis

Included guidelines were synthesized descriptively including summary and detailed tables of guideline characteristics and recommendations. Where available, information on relevant subgroups were highlighted.The synthesis will involve providing a descriptive summary of included studies with summary tables and detailed tables of study results. Tables of study results will be organized according to interventions of interest and reported outcomes and where available, information on relevant subgroups will be presented separately.

Literature Search

The database search returned a total of 3,267 citations, while the grey literature searches returned 32 citations for level 1 screening. A total of 3,183 citations were excluded after level 1 screening. Of the 116 full-text articles screened at level 2, 17 clinical practice guidelines were included ( Figure 1 ).

Characteristics of included clinical practice guidelines

The 17 clinical practice guidelines were produced by organizations in the United States (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). The topics covered by the guidelines included influenza (n=6), infection control in long-term care facilities in general (n=2), respiratory illness outbreaks (n=5), pneumonia (n=1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (n=1), and COVID-19 (n=2). Detailed characteristics of the included guidelines can be found in Appendix 4.

Quality Appraisal Results

The 17 clinical practice guidelines were of very low quality (Table 1) . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20039180 doi: medRxiv preprint 

Guideline Recommendations

Preventing respiratory illness in long-term care facilities: Two or more clinical practice guidelines recommended the following: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment (n=13), social distancing/isolation (n=13), disinfecting surfaces (n=12), droplet precautions (n=12), surveillance and evaluation (n=11), conducting diagnostic testing to confirm suspected respiratory illness (n=10), policies and procedures for visitors (n=9), respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette (n=9), policies and procedures for staff and/or residents (n=9), providing supplies (n=9), education of staff and/or residents (n=8), increasing communication (n=6), consulting or notifying health professionals (n=6), appropriate ventilation practices (n=2), and cohorting equipment (n=2) ( Table 2 , Appendix 6). One clinical practice guideline recommended appropriate air ventilation or smoking cessation.Managing respiratory illness in long-term care facilities: Ten clinical practice guidelines recommended the use of antivirals for prophylaxis of staff and/or residents and one recommended early mobilization of residents ( Table 2 , Appendix 6).

DISCUSSION

The WHO commissioned a rapid review to address the urgent question of the infection prevention and control practices/measures for respiratory viruses in long-term care facilities that could be applied to COVID-19. A comprehensive literature search of both electronic databases and grey literature sources resulted 17 included clinical practice guidelines. None of the clinical practice guidelines specifically focused on issues related to residents with respiratory illness and severe comorbidities or frailty. Furthermore, none focused on issues in LMIC or different cultural contexts.The most commonly recommended prevention strategies across the clinical practice guidelines were hand hygiene, wearing personal protective equipment, social distancing/isolation, disinfecting surfaces, droplet precautions, surveillance and evaluation, conducting diagnostic testing to confirm suspected respiratory illness, policies and procedures for visitors, policies and procedures for staff, and respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette. For managing respiratory illness in long-term care facilities, the majority of the clinical practice guidelines recommended antivirals for prophylaxis of staff and/or residents. However, most of the clinical practice guidelines failed to address multiple AGREE-II items, suggesting that they are most likely based on expert opinion.There are several limitations to the review methods employed here, single screening and abstraction for example, however they were selected to thoughtfully tailor our methods according to our knowledge user needs and the urgent nature of the request to provide timely results. There is also a chance that our literature search missed guidance documents from various state and provincial authorities. However, we were unable to perform an exhaustive grey literature search of websites, due to the timelines imposed on this review.

CONCLUSIONS

The recommendations from current guidelines overall seem to support environmental measures for infection prevention and antiviral chemoprophylaxis for infection management as the most appropriate first-line response to viral respiratory illness in long-term care. However, these recommendations should be viewed with caution as it is unclear how many of these guidelines are based on the best available evidence due to their poor overall quality. Objective and research questions:

APPENDIX 1 -PROTOCOL

The Infection Prevention & Control of the WHO WHE Programme has presented a query on the transmission of COVID-19 in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care including privately paid for and publicly paid for settings with a 5business day timeline. According to the World Health Organization, ""long-term care covers those activities undertaken by others to ensure that people with, or at risk of, a significant ongoing loss of intrinsic capacity can maintain a level of functional ability consistent with their basic rights, fundamental freedoms and human dignity"" (https://www.who.int/ageing/long-term-care/WHO-LTC-series-subsaharanafrica.pdf?ua=1) Examples of long-term care will include nursing homes, charitable homes, municipal homes, long-term care hospitals, long-term care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, convalescent homes, and assisted living facilities (https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/home-continuing-care/long-termfacilities-based-care.html).The proposed research questions are:1. What are the infection prevention and control practices/measures for preventing or reducing respiratory viruses (including coronavirus and influenza) in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care? 2. How do infection prevention and control practices differ for adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care with respiratory illness and severe comorbidities or frailty differ than those without such severe comorbidities/frailty? 3. How do infection prevention and control practices differ for adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care with respiratory illness from low-and middle-income economy countries (LMIC) differ than those living in high-income economy countries and do differences exist across different cultural contexts?Research approach:. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org /10.1101 /10. /2020 The research question will be addressed through a rapid review informed by the methods proposed by the WHO Guide to rapid reviews (https://www.who.int/alliancehpsr/resources/publications/rapid-review-guide/en/).

Protocol

Due to the urgent nature of the request and limited time frame to complete the work, this document will serve as the protocol for this query. If publication in a peer-reviewed journal is planned in the future, we will register this rapid review with the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/).

Literature search

Comprehensive literature searches will be developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org, and GIDEON (Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network). Grey (i.e., difficult to locate or unpublished) literature will be searched via clinicaltrials.gov. Due to the rapid timelines for this review a peer review of the literature search will not be conducted.

Eligibility criteria

The Eligibility criteria will follow the PICOST framework and will consist of:Population: Individuals aged 60 years and above residing in long-term care facilities. The age cut-off for an older adult might be 50 years and above in some LMIC and/or cultural settings. As such, we will include these in level 1 screening of titles and abstracts and include anything deemed relevant at level 2 screening of full-text articles in an appendix.Interventions: Any form of infection control and prevention, such as hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene/etiquette, personal protective equipment (for patients and health care providers), triage (on arrival), source control, isolation, daily monitoring/surveillance for signs and symptoms of respiratory illness (e.g., in residence, environmental cleaning, cleaning of linen and medical equipment used by patients, restrictions on resident movement and transportation, restrictions on visitors, restrictions on travel for health care providers and other long-term care facility staff, waste management, dead body management. Only those measures used to prevent and control respiratory illnesses, including influenza and coronavirus (e.g., COVID-19, MERS, SARS) will be included. Interventions focused on preventing bacterial respiratory outbreaks (e.g., strep, pneumonia, klebsiella) will be excluded.Comparator: One of the interventions listed above or no intervention . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org /10.1101 /10. /2020 Outcomes: Lab-confirmed respiratory illness due to the virus (e.g., SARS, MERS, COVID-19, influenza) [primary outcome], secondary bacterial infection, symptoms, secondary transmission (e.g., other patients, healthcare workers, visitors), goal concordant care, hospitalization, intensive-care unit (ICU) admission, mortality Study designs: Due to the rapid nature of this request, we will limit inclusion to clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews, using the Cochrane definition of a systematic review. If there is scant evidence from these study designs, we will expand inclusion to include the following study designs:o Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) o NRCTs (e.g., such as quasi-RCTs, non-randomized trials, interrupted time series, controlled before after), o Observational studies (e.g., cohort, case control, cross-sectional) o Case studies, case reports, and case series, including outbreak reports Time periods: All periods of time and duration of follow-up will be included.Other limitations: No other limitations will be imposed. If possible, we will translate studies written in languages other than English (e.g., Mandarin, Cantonese) that are deemed relevant.

Study selection process

In order to meet the requested timeline of 5 working days a streamlined approach to study selection will be employed. A screening form based on the eligibility criteria will be prepared and a brief calibration exercise will be conducted prior to citation and full-text screening. Screening will be completed by single reviewers using Synthesi.SR, the team's proprietary online software (https://breakthroughkt.ca/login.php).

Data items and data abstraction process

Items for data abstraction will include study characteristics (e.g., duration of follow-up, study design, country of conduct, multi-center vs. single site, long-term care setting characteristics, such as availability of medical support, characteristics of care staff, family/community engagement, accommodation characteristics, collective practices), patient characteristics (e.g., mean age, age range, co-morbidities), intervention details (e.g., type of intervention, duration and frequency of intervention, timing of intervention), comparator details (e.g., comparator intervention, duration and frequency of intervention, timing of intervention), and outcome results (e.g., lab-confirmed viral respiratory infection, symptoms, secondary transmission, hospitalization, ICU admission, mortality) at the longest duration of follow-up. For the clinical practice guidelines, we will abstract the recommendations and level of evidence for reach recommendation.Prior to data abstraction, we will complete a calibration exercise of the form amongst all reviewers using a random sample of 2 included articles. Following calibration, included studies will be abstracted by single reviewers.

Risk of bias appraisal

Risk of bias appraisal will be carried out by single reviewers using the AMSTAR-2 tool (https://amstar.ca/Amstar-2.php) for systematic reviews and the AGREE-2 tool (https://www.agreetrust.org/resource-centre/agree-reporting-checklist/) for clinical practice guidelines.

Preliminary knowledge translation plan:

The summary of results will be sent to the WHO and other relevant policy-makers as a brief summary report (1-5 pages) and 1-page policy brief (see http://www.cihrirsc.gc.ca/e/documents/dsen-abstract-en.pdf for an example). We will work with the WHO team to consider submitting this paper to an open-access, peer-reviewed journal for publication (e.g. British Medical Journal).

"Abstract

Data visualization is an important tool for exploring and communicating findings in medical research, and specially in epidemiological surveillance. The COVID19-Tracker app systematically produces daily updated data visualization and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Spain. It collects automatically daily data on COVID-19 diagnosed cases, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality, from February 24 th , 2020 onwards. Two applications have already been developed; 1) to analyze data trends and estimating short-term projections; and 2) To assess the effect of the lockdown on the trend of incident data. We are currently planning to improve the app by uploading shortly new applications for data visualization and analysis, which may help for a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic data in Spain.

","INTRODUCTION

The first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain were identified in late February 2020 (1) . Since then, Spain became, by the end of March, the third most affected country worldwide after the United States and Italy and recorded the second number of deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic after Italy (2) . Since March 16 th , lockdown measures oriented on flattening the epidemic curve were in place in Spain, restricting social contact, reducing public transport, and closing businesses, except for those essential to the country's supply chains (3) . However, this has not been enough to change the rising trend of the epidemic. For this reason, a more restrictive lockdown was suggested (4), and eventually undertaken by the Spanish Government on March 30 th (5) .Data visualization is an important tool for exploring and communicating findings in medical research, and specially in epidemiological surveillance. It can help researchers and policy makers to identify and understand trends that could be overlooked if the data were reviewed in tabular form. We have developed a Shiny app allows users to evaluate daily time-series data from a statistical standpoint. The COVID19-Tracker app systematically produces daily updated data visualization and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic data in Spain. It is easy to use and fills a role in the tool space for visualization, analysis and exploration of epidemiological data during this particular scenario.

SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY AND REQUIREMENTS

The COVID19-Track app has been developed in RStudio using the Shiny package (6) .Shiny offers the ability to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that can be run locally or deployed online. Last is particularly beneficial to show and communicate updated findings to a broad audience.The app has a friendly structure based on menus to shown data visualization for each of the analyses currently implemetned: projections, intervention, and methodology sections ( Figure 1 )..

The app has an automated process to update data and all analyses every time a user connects to the app. It is available online at the following link: https://ubidi.shinyapps.io/covid19/ and shortly free available on GitHub as an R package.

DATA SOURCES

We collected daily data on COVID-19 diagnosed cases, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and mortality, from February 24th onwards. Data is collected automatically every day daily from Datadista github repository (7). This repository updates data according to the calendar and rate of publication of the Spanish Ministry of Health/Instituto de Salud Carlos III (8) .Data corresponding to the available number of ICU beds in Spain (year 2017) are also obtained from the Datadista github repository (7)..

Projections

For the evaluation of the observed trends of the accumulated number of cases, we used a classical quasi-Poisson regression model (9), allowing for over-dispersion and with a logarithmic link function, evaluating the existence of a quadratic effect. The two models are described as follows:Model 2: log(E(ct))=β0+β1t+β2t 2 where t = 1, 2, …, T represents the time unit (from the first observed day until the last, T consecutive days in total), and it assumes that ct, the observed cases, are distributed following a quasi-Poisson probability law. Estimated parameters and their standard error are used to obtain the predictions in the observed period of time but also the short-term projections, computing 95% confidence interval (95%CI)or the expected number of cases.The analyses have been carried out using R version 3.6.3.This analysis is accessible on the Projections menu, displaying short-term projections up to 3 days for COVID19 diagnosed cases, ICUs, and mortality in a time-series plot ( Figure   2 ). Results are available nationwide by default, but also at the regional level, allowing a dropdown menu for this purpose. In addition, the produced graph is mouse-sensitive, showing the exact number of observed and predicted/projected cases for both models through the time-series. .

Intervention analysis

To assess the effect of the lockdown on the trend of incident cases, admissions in ICU intensive care units, and mortality, we used an interrupted time-series design (10) . The data is analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression with an interaction model to estimate the change in trend:log(E(ct))=β0+β1t+β2lockdown+β3t * lockdown where t =1, 2, …, T represents the time unit (from the first observed day until the last, T consecutive days in total); and lockdown is a binary variable that identifies the periods before after the alarm status decree (0 = before Mar 15 th , 2020; 1 = after Mar 16 th , 2020).The analyses have been carried out using R, version 3.6.3.We should acknowledge that this is a descriptive analysis without predictive purposes.For an easy interpretation, and comparison of the effectiveness of lockdown measures between countries, a linear trend is assumed before and after the lockdown. The changes in the definition of diagnosed cases have not been taken into account, nor has the reduction in the susceptible population because of the lockdown. Therefore, the incident cases are modelled directly instead of the incidence rate, assuming that the entire population is at risk. Although not accounted for residual autocorrelation, the estimates are unbiased but possibly inefficient.This analysis is accessible on the Intervention menu, displaying trends in a time-series plot before and after the lockdown for COVID19 diagnosed cases, ICUs, and mortality ( Figure 3 ). The daily percentage (%) mean increase and its 95%CI are also reported.Results are available nationwide..

Further developing

So far, the COVID19-Tracker app has been very well received online, with a large number of connections generating an outsized memory usage on our server ( Figure 4 ). We are currently planning to improve the app by uploading shortly new applications for data visualization and analysis, which may help for a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic data in Spain. Moreover, the COVID19-Tracker app could also be extensible to data visualizations across other countries and geographical regions..

"Abstract

The rapid spread of COVID-19 virus from China to other countries and outbreaks of disease require an epidemiological analysis of the disease in the shortest time and an increased awareness of effective interventions. The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data Methods: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, timedependent recovery rate, and time-dependent mortality rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. Findings: On average, 925 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within one week (15.03.2020 to 03.21.2020) and reaches its highest point on 03.18.2020 with 1126 infected cases.The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.

","Introduction

Transmission of coronavirus-associated pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019 (1) . According to the latest WHO report on 11 March 2020, there were 118,329 confirmed cases and 4627 deaths worldwide, with 8042 confirmed cases and 291 deaths reported in Iran (2). The World Health Organization (WHO) named it a global pandemic on 11March 2020 because of the rapid outbreak of the disease worldwide (3) . The course of each epidemic depends on a number of important factors such as the Basic Reproductive Rate, the doubling time or serial interval, and the fatality rate. Estimating the epidemiological factors of COVID-19 and modeling-based prediction are useful in assessing epidemic transmission rates, predicting epidemic trends, and designing control measures (4, 5) .The rapid spread of COVID-19 virus from China to other countries and outbreaks of disease require an epidemiological analysis of the disease in the shortest time and an increased awareness of effective interventions. What happened in China showed that quarantine, evacuation, and isolation of infected populations can become epidemic. This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for many countries where COVID-19 has begun to expand. However, it is not clear that other countries can implement the measures that the Chinese eventually adopted to reduce and control the incidence in the future (4, 6

This allowed us to estimate parameters by accessing more data Figures (1-4) .Step2: We put the fitting function for β(t), in the first step along with the actual trend parameters of Iran in Figures (5-7) and found that the behavior parameters of Iran are similar toChina.Step3: The conclusion of step 2 has many benefits for us because we cannot obtain the behavior of the parameters for Iran. Accordingly, we can use the Chinese parameters to predict the number of Iranian patients in the last step ( Figure 8 ).But the question remained on how to fit each parameter in China model. Many data in the environmental sciences do not fit simple linear models and are best described by ""wiggly models"", also known as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). We used GAMs to estimate β(t), and models fit by REML (Restricted Maximum likelihood)One of the main reasons for using GAMs models was that we did not know the distributions of parameters, so we could not use a parametric approach like non-linear least squares (NLS).We did all the analysis with R software. Also, mgcv package in R was used to fit generalized additive models.

Result

The first phase (03.12.2020 -03.15.2020): We expect daily diagnoses to increase from 1002 to 1095 until the end of the initial phase.The third phase (03.26.2020 -04.10.2020): In this phase, it is expected that the downward trend will continue until 04. 10 .2020 if the intervention measures continue at current intensity..

Discussion

Our estimation show that the COVID-19 epidemic trend in Iran will rise from March 8, 2020 and will peak during March 15 to 21, and there will be a decreasing trend from 22 to 29 March 2020.Under such circumstances, two types of hypotheses can be considered for the adequacy of the current measures and as to whether the epidemic peak will occur during March 15-21, 2020.Assuming that the current measures are inefficient and inadequate, the number of estimated cases Restrictive measures must be taken against the general population or the population that may spread the disease to prevent a major epidemic from continuing. 3. Virus tracking. In addition, the main source of the virus must be traced to understand the origin of the virus and effective measures must be taken to completely eliminate the source of the virus (9-11)..

New mobile hospitals should be built that can handle suspected cases in a centralized manner. This is essential to alleviate the pressure of treating the masses of infected patients in large hospitals. For example, during this outbreak, the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan lasted only 10 days to be built for people infected with coronavirus. During the whole process, the epidemic situation should be reported in a timely and transparent manner. It also prevents unexpected public pressure and reduces unnecessary mental health problems.Artificial intelligence technology can play a key role in almost every aspect including traffic management, infection detection, logistics supply chain, etc. This is a very important feature of a modern data-driven smart city. If the status of each citizen is listed, all can be accurately tracked and any population can be accommodated. Therefore, the flow of population can be controlled in a more orderly manner. Artificial intelligence technologies can be used to employ smart devices to support diagnosis and treatment, and can be used in telecommunications, online training and intelligent manufacturing to ensure minimal disruption to people's lives. Some hospitals use smart systems. Train stations can install powerful thermal imagers to measure the body temperature of passengers. Overall, efficiency and speed are very important in the control process, and conflicting research needs to be conducted (9-11).In response to the outbreak, China expanded its day-to-day contact with the WHO, regardless of economic disadvantages, and developed comprehensive multifaceted approaches to tackle the virus and prevent further exposure to the virus by taking rigorous and unprecedented measures arising from a sense of responsibility to citizens. It also disseminated its epidemic information .

How people respond to recommendations on preventing transmission is more important than government measures. The government's strategy of communicating with the public to inform them about infection prevention is also crucial. Extra support for managing the recession is also important. However, it is not clear that other countries can implement the measures that the Chinese eventually adopted to reduce and control the incidence in the future. Extensive capacity is needed for such a level of medical care, which is a health emergency and is particularly challenging. We hope that the analytical results of this study will help to clarify important aspects of the outbreak so that the spread of coronavirus in different locations can be minimized in the shortest possible time.One of the limitations of this study is the uncertainty of data on the first days of the epidemic in Iran. The distribution of data in the first week of the epidemic was such that the fitting of each parameter of the model with Iranian data through NLS or polynomial regression models posed problems so that we could not identify a better model with AIC or BIC criteria

Conclusion:

The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact..

"Abstract

Note: this report is a pre-print and has not yet been peer-reviewed.As the number of novel coronavirus cases grows both inside and outside of China, public health authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening of arrivals at airports. We evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-nCoV infection. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46.5% (95%CI: 35.9 to 57.7) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers. We developed an online tool so that results can be updated as new information becomes available.As of 29 Jan 2019, 5,997 confirmed and 9,239 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV have been reported from China with 132 deaths confirmed so far 1 . There were cases in at least 15 other countries, identified due to symptoms plus recent travel history to Hubei province, China, which strongly suggests that the reported cases constitute only a small fraction of the actual number of infected individuals in China 2 . While the most affected region, Hubei province, has now ceased air travel and closed major public transport routes 3 it is unlikely that these measures will fully contain the outbreak.Despite limited evidence for its effectiveness 4,5 , airport screening is frequently implemented to limit the probability of infected cases entering other regions or countries. Here we use the available evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for detecting travellers with 2019-nCoV.

","Simulation of travellers at each stage of infection

We simulated 100 infected air travellers who are still infected with 2019-nCoV on arrival at their destination and hence would pose a risk for seeding transmission in a new region. The duration of travel is the flight time plus a small amount of additional travel time for airport procedures. We assumed that most individuals will develop symptoms, including fever, at the end of their incubation period and progress to more severe symptoms after a few days, resulting in hospitalisation and isolation. Individuals may also exhibit an asymptomatic (subclinical) infection where they do not exhibit symptoms that would be detected by thermal scanning or cause them to seek medical care, although these individuals may be infectious. Travellers may exhibit severe symptoms during their travel; upon arrival they are hospitalised without undergoing entry screening. We then estimated the proportion of travellers who would be detected by exit and entry screening, develop severe symptoms during travel, or go undetected, under varying assumptions of:-the proportion of asymptomatic infections; -the sensitivity of exit and entry screening; -the duration of travel; -the incubation period; -the time from the start of symptoms until hospitalisation (Table 1) .We assume that the time of starting travel is randomly and uniformly distributed between the time of infection and twice the expected time to severe disease; however, we only consider those travellers who depart before their symptoms worsen to the point that they would seek hospital care 6 . We simulate travellers with individual incubation period, time from onset to severe disease, flight start times and detection success at exit and entry screening according to the screening sensitivities ( Figure 3 ). We consider only the travel of infected individuals (not the proportion of travellers who are infected) and therefore assume a screening specificity of 100%. An individual will be detected at exit screening if their infection is not asymptomatic, their departure time exceeds their incubation period, and their stochastic exit screening success indicates detection. An individual will be detected at entry screening if their infection is not asymptomatic, their incubation period ends after their departure but before their arrival, they have not been detected at exit screening, and their entry screening success indicates detection. Entry screening detections are further divided into detection due to severe symptoms and detection of mild symptoms via equipment such as thermal scanners. We used 10,000 bootstrap samples to calculate 95% confidence intervals.The model code is available via GitHub 7 and the results can be further explored in an R Shiny app at https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/traveller_screening/ ( Figure 1 ). .

Effect of screening on detection

For the baseline scenario we estimated that 44 (95%CI: 33-56) of 100 infected travellers would be detected by exit screening, 0 (95% CI: 0-3) case would develop severe symptoms during travel, 9 (95%CI: 2-16) additional cases would be detected by entry screening, and the remaining 46 (95%CI: 36-58) would not be detected.The effectiveness of entry screening is largely dependent on the effectiveness of exit screening in place. Under baseline assumptions, entry screening could detect 53 (95%CI: 35-72) instead of 9 infected travellers if no exit screening was in place. However, the probability of developing symptoms mid-flight increases with flight time and hence exit screening is more effective for longer flights (Figure 2 ).Syndromic screening designed to prevent infected and potentially infectious cases entering undetected is highly vulnerable to asymptomatic infections and long incubation periods. If the baseline scenario is modified to have 0% asymptomatic infections and 100% sensitivity of entry screening, the incubation period will need to be approximately 10-fold shorter than the period from symptom onset to severe disease (e.g. hospitalisation) in order to detect more than 90% of infected travellers that would not otherwise report illness at either exit or entry screening..

Conclusions A s a response to the ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, the Chinese government has implemented exit screening for international flights leaving China's major airports. Thermal scanning, which can identify passengers with fever (high external body temperature), allows for passengers exhibiting symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection to be tested before they board a flight. Similarly, entry screening for flights originating in the most affected regions may be considered at airports in regions in and outside China. We estimate that the key goal of syndromic screening at airports -to prevent infected travellers from entering regions with little or no ongoing transmission -is only achievable if the rate of asymptomatic infections that are transmissible is negligible, screening sensitivity is almost perfect, and the incubation period is short. Based on data from Li et al. (2020) 8 , 2019-nCoV has a shorter incubation period than SARS, and a higher rate of asymptomatic infections 9 . Under generally conservative assumptions on sensitivity, we find that 46.5% of infected travellers will enter undetected.Entry screening is an intuitive barrier for the prevention of infections entering a region or country. However, evidence on its effectiveness is limited and given the lack of specificity, it generates a high overhead of screened travellers uninfected with the targeted pathogen 4 . For example, when entry screening was implemented in Australia in response to the 2003 SARS .

While some cases of 2019-nCoV have been identified through airport screening in the current outbreak we estimate that likely many more infected travellers have passed through screening undetected.It is important to note that our estimates are based on a number of key assumptions that cannot yet be informed directly by evidence from the ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreak. The current outbreak has spread rapidly and early evidence suggests that the average severity is lower than SARS. This may also suggest a substantial proportion of asymptomatic cases. A recent analysis of a family transmission cluster is based on a small sample size but 1 in 6 infections was asymptomatic 9 ; a major impediment for the effectiveness of syndromic screening. However, if asymptomatic cases were not infectious they would not pose a risk for seeding infection chains on arrival. To allow easy adaptation of our results as new insight becomes available in the coming weeks we developed an online app.Furthermore, the most up-to-date data on the incubation period or the time until recovery of 2019-nCoV has been used in this analysis, yet these figures are likely to change over time as more data becomes available. Unless the incubation period is only a small fraction of the duration of clinical symptoms, and fever in particular, syndromic screening is likely to detect an insufficient fraction of infected cases to prevent local infections. In addition, the sensitivity of airport screening for the detection of 2019-nCoV has not been evaluated. However, we chose conservative estimates and show that with reduced sensitivity the effectiveness of syndromic screening would further decline.In many international airports, information is provided to travellers from affected regions advising recommended action if they develop symptoms on or after arrival [11] [12] [13] [14] . While this is likely to be an effective strategy, we find that airport screening for initial symptoms, via thermal scanners or similar, on either exit or entry is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers in order to avoid entry of infected travellers and therefore the potential for seeding of local transmission.

"Abstract

SARS-CoV2 is a novel highly virulent pathogen which gains entry to human cells by binding with the cell surface receptor -angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). We contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) from (i) SARS-CoV2, (ii) the related but less virulent OC43 (Singapore COVID-19 strain), and (iii) the 2002 epidemiccausing SARS-CoV1. We find that the RBDs of the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 are highly optimized to achieve the strongest possible binding interaction with ACE2 which is consistent with its enhanced pathogenicity. SARS-CoV2 RBDs form the most stable complex with ACE2 (64.91%, and 28.07% higher binding scores than SARS-CoV1 and OC43, respectively) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. In fact, the spike protein RBDs from SARS-CoV2 out-compete the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 64% in terms of binding affinity (quantified using the Rosetta scoring function). They accomplish this through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.

RBDs with the human ACE2 complex to explain the difference in the degree of pathogenesis for the three strains. We provide a comparative analysis of the most important RBD residues from the three spike proteins that drive the binding with ACE2. We computationally assess that SARS-CoV2 outcompetes the human ATR1 surface receptor protein to preferentially bind the human ACE2. The role of the highly enhanced binding of RBDs from the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 in explaining pathogenicity has received so far limited attention in the COVID-19 scientific reports.There has been a recent communication by Wan et al. 2 to explain interactions between ACE2 and SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV2 RBDs, but the study was limited to (a) using a homology modeled structure of SARS-CoV2 RBD, (b) only exploring five residues from the spike RBDs, (c) not exploring the case of the OC43 strain, and (d) not analyzing the effect of spike-ACE2 binding on ATR1-ACE2 complex. To this end, we have used the experimentally confirmed atomic scale maps (cryo-EM structures) of not only the SARS-CoV2 RBD in complex with ACE2, but also that of OC43 (which however, is not complexed with ACE2). We generated the OC43-ACE2 complex using protein-protein docking (see Methods).

Analysis of human ACE2 in complex with spike RBDs from the three different coronavirus strains

Rosetta-based energy minimization of the ACE2-RBD complexes with RBDs from SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2, and OC43 reveals that SARS-CoV2 exhibits the strongest binding (613.02 Rosetta energy units).SARS-CoV1 and OC43 binding scores with ACE2 are 215.159 and 440.94 Rosetta energy units, respectively. In an uninfected human cell, ATR1 receptor binds to ACE2 to form a receptor complex, whereas at the onset of infection, the coronavirus presents the RBD of its spike protein to human ACE2 protein for an electrostatically-driven association between the two. Our results indicate that ACE2 can bind with either human ATR1 or the viral spike as the binding domains overlap. ACE2 can form hydrophobic and strong electrostatic (including pi-pi, and cation-pi) interactions with the binding domain of ATR1. The viral spike RBDs mimics these interactions to gain entry via strong non-covalent attachment.To understand the role of the inter-residue interaction network formed during viral entry, we first constructed a contact map depicting all such interactions for the spike-binding interface of unbound ACE2 (see Figure 1 ). We then computed the transitions in this contact map for the ACE2-RBD complex for each one of the three cases (i.e., SARS-CoV2, OC83, and SARS-CoV1). We observe that SARS-CoV2 co-opts the original contact map to form the strongest possible ACE2-RBD interface (see Figure   1 ). and other neighboring residues of ACE2. The yellow diagonal region shows contacts within these neighboring residues. Finally, the blue padded regions show contacts at the ACE2-RBD binding interface. The width of these blue regions determines the number of RBD residues that form strong electrostatic or hydrophobic contacts with ACE2. Long-range electrostatic interactions (4.5Å< but >6.0Å) between the spike and ACE2 are not shown.We observe that SARS-CoV2 forms the greatest number of effective ACE2 contacts (16 electrostatic and three hydrophobic) using ten RBD residues at the ACE2 binding interface (see blue region in Figure 1 ).In comparison, the spike protein RBD for SARS-CoV1 and OC43 are only able to form nine (six) strong electrostatic contacts using five (three) RBD residues, respectively. This does not imply that SARS-CoV1 and OC43 only present five (three) residues, respectively to bind to ACE2. The other interface residues either form weak electrostatic contacts or are simply non-interacting. Table 1 lists the strong pairwise interactions between the RBDs and ACE2 along with the corresponding distances. Therefore, it appears that SARS-CoV2 reforms the original contact map with ACE2 by leveraging 35% (9 out of 26) of selfstabilizing contacts around the spike-binding domain to form 19 new complex-stabilizing contacts.SARS-CoV1 and OC83 show weaker attachments as they are each able to co-opt only 15% (4 out of 26) contacts.In silico alanine scanning to identify spike residues most important for ACE2 binding Each one of the ACE2 binding residues from the three viral spike RBDs was computationally mutated to alanine (one at a time) and the resultant ACE2-RBD complexes were energy minimized and scored using Rosetta force field. This procedure assesses how important is the identity of the native residues by defaulting them to alanine and observing whether this significantly affects binding. In detail, the percent The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015891 doi: bioRxiv preprint loss of ACE2 binding upon an alanine mutation was used as a proxy score for assessing the importance a particular RBD residue in binding and subsequent pathogenesis. The results from the alanine scan study (see Figure 2 ) reveal that 88% (15 out of 17) of the ACE2 interface residues of SARS-CoV2 are important for complex formation. Even a single alanine mutation in any of these reduces the binding score by ~60%. These results imply that the SARS-CoV2 RBD of the spike protein are highly optimized for binding with ACE2. We note that positions Lys417 and Gly502 have the strongest impact on binding (75% and 83% reduction upon mutation to Ala, respectively). This is because they help establish one strong electrostatic contact with Asp30, and three with Gln325, Lys353, and Gly354 (as listed in Table   1 ). Our results also identify the same three residues Phe486, Gln493, and Asn501 to be important for ACE2 binding as proposed by Wan et al. 2 . In their study, they used a homology modeled SARS-CoV2 RBD instead of experimentally resolved atomic coordinates for the description of the protein binding event. We calculated that Phe486, Gln493, and Asn501 establish three new contacts each (see Table 1 for interaction partners and inter-residue distances), and their mutation to Ala (even for only one of them) leads to loss of ACE2 binding by more than ~62.5%. coronavirus. Bars represent the residual ACE2 binding score upon alanine mutation at the indicated site normalized with respect to binding score prior to mutation.The alanine scan of the spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV1, on the other hand shows less significant penalty to the binding score upon mutation to alanine. Only six residues (Tyr436, Tyr440, Asn473, Tyr484, Thr486, and Thr487) seen to be involved in strong electrostatic coupling with ACE2 residues (indicated in Table 1 ). In addition, Gly488Ala and Gly482Ala mutations lead to 41% and 72% loss of ACE2 binding, respectively. In summary, alanine scans indicate that SARS-CoV2 has the highest number of ""effectively"" interacting residues at the ACE2 binding interface whereas the SARS-CoV1 spike forms only a few strong ACE2 connectors with a large number of ""idle"" interface residues (43% -7 out of 16) which do not affect ACE2 binding upon mutation to alanine. OC83 seems to be between the two with a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015891 doi: bioRxiv preprint maximum number of weak electrostatic interactors (43% -7 out of 16) and only two idle residues at the interface (i.e., residues Asn239 and Tyr241). 

Presence of tyrosines and glycines in ACE2 binding domains of these spike proteins

Both the SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV2 ACE2 binding domains are enriched in tyrosines. As many as 25% (4 out of 16 residues) and 26.3% (5 out of 19 residues) are tyrosines, respectively. In contrast, OC83has only one tyrosine (among 16 residues). We have not explored the phylogenetic basis for the presence of tyrosines but they do seem to be important for conferring high binding affinity between SARS-CoV2 and ACE2 as alluded to by the alanine scan (see Figure 2 ). In contrast, the tyrosines in SARS-CoV1(Tyr442, Tyr475, and Tyr491) are mostly idle. We use Figure 3 to explain two representative cases of interface tyrosines from both SARS-CoV2 (Tyr473 and Tyr489) and SARS-CoV1 (Tyr442 and Tyr475) RBDs.The SARS-CoV2 tyrosine backbones, even though on a loop, are mutually stabilized by hydrogen bonding and the side chains are locked in place by a pi-pi aromatic interactions between the phenyl rings.This enables both of these tyrosine side-chains to form a strong electrostatic contact with Thr27 side chain of ACE2. It is thus unsurprising that both mutation Y473A and Y489A result in a similar (58.5% and 59.1%, respectively -as shown in Figure 2 ) reduction in binding with ACE2. In contrast, in the energy .

Next, we focus on the role of glycine residues in all three spike RBDs which form important electrostatic contacts with ACE2. They lead to more than 55% loss of binding (on average) upon mutation to alanine.We choose to study in detail one such representative glycine from each spike RBD -Gly502 from SARS-CoV2, Gly488 from SARS-CoV1, and Gly220 from OC83. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015891 doi: bioRxiv preprint Glycine residues seem to play a very crucial, though indirect, role in effecting a strong capture of the ACE2 protein. Interestingly, in both SARS-CoV variants, the capture mechanism of the ACE2 residue Lys353 by glycine residues in the spike protein is the same. Atomic coordinates of both these complexes were independently, and experimentally confirmed by Song et al. 3 

in 2018 and Wang et al. in 2020

(manuscript unpublished but structure deposited at -www.rcsb.org/structure/6lzg). In both cases the SARS-CoV spike RBD uses a combination of a cation-and a strong electrostatic interaction to bind with Lys353. The electrostatic interaction is mediated by Asn501 in SARS-CoV2 and Thr487 in SARS-CoV1.Two glycine residues and a short hydrophobic group together allows the Asn501 (and Thr487 for SARS-CoV1) to be within strong electrostatic reach of Lys353 while ensuring a cation-interaction between Tyr505 (and Tyr491 for SARS-CoV1) and Lys353. Mutation Y505A (or Y491A for SARS-CoV1) has no effect on ACE2 binding. However, mutation to alanine of either Gly502 or Asn501 (or their corresponding residues in SARS-CoV1) leads to >70% loss of ACE2 binding. Thus, we recover a strong functional motif, which is conserved between the two SARS-CoV strains.Sequence alignment of the three RBD sequences reveal a conserved motif in all three sequences (see Figure 4 ). Further inspection of the sequence alignment reveals (see Figure 4 ) that all of the three other conserved binding motifs for ACE2 hotspot residues (Thr27, Asp38, and Gln42) have a key glycine (and rarely alanine) which presumably offers a hinge to orient a neighboring polar residue to bind to a specific ACE2 residue.

Competitive ACE2 binding of spike RBDs and angiotensin receptor (ATR1)

We reported on the differences between three viral ACE2-RBD complexes and how they exploit the contact map of RBD-binding domain of human ACE2 receptor to facilitate binding. In an uninfected cell, through the action of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 forms a complex with the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) 4 . Due to the lack of an experimentally resolved structure for the ACE2-ATR1 complex, we used protein-protein docking and Rosetta-binding score screening to identify the most stable configuration of the complex. Analysis of the ACE2-ATR1 binding interface reveals 41 ACE2 residues and 26 ATR1 residues at the interface connected by five strong electrostatic contacts and several long range weak electrostatic contacts. We find that eleven SARS-CoV2 RBD binding residues of ACE2 are shared by the ATR1 binding region. Moreover, SARS-CoV2 RBD binds ACE2 with ~64% better binding score than ATR1. In contrast, SARS-CoV1 show ~2.1% worse binding score with ACE2 compared to the ACE2-ATR1 complex while sharing only nine residues with the ATR1 binding interface of ACE2 (see We computationally explored the potential margin of improvement for the binding affinity of SARS-CoV2 with ACE2 using the IPRO 5 protein design software. We allowed all 21 contacting residues of the RBD of the spike protein to simultaneously mutate. We run two separate design trajectories (see The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015891 doi: bioRxiv preprint supplementary information) and, in both cases the best design achieved an approximately 25% improvement in binding affinity using the Rosetta scoring function. This improvement is less than the difference between the calculated binding scores of SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV2 implying that SARS-CoV2 has already achieved over 50% of the theoretically possible binding affinity gain with ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV1. Interestingly, the network of glycine residues in SARS-CoV2 is conserved in all redesigned RBDs.

Summary

We believe that the computational results presented herein are responsive to the recent call to contrast the two SARS-CoV and OC43 strains heralded in the recent press release (March 20, 2020) by the Scripps Research Institute 6 . We also provide key biophysical insights to explain the differences in pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 in comparison to OC43 and SARS-CoV1. Multiple lines of computational evidence indicate that the spike RBDs gain entry into the human cell through electrostatic attachment with every fourth residue on the N-terminal alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible.

Methods

We have used experimentally determined coordinates of SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV2 in complex with ACE2 (PDB accessions: 6ACG 3 and 6LZG -www.rcsb.org/structure/6lzg, respectively). OC43 RBD was isolated from the crystal structure of the whole OC43 spike (PDB: 6OHW 7 ). Similarly, unbound ATR1 structure (PDB: 4YAY 8 ) was also separately downloaded and docked against ACE2 using protein-protein docking scripts from Z-DOCK 3.0 9 . ZDOCK uses pairwise shape-complementarity, electrostatics, and implicit solvation terms in scoring the docked poses. Implicit solvation treats the water as a dielectric continuum. The rotational sampling interval was set to 10°. Clustering of the docked poses were done at an 8 Å cutoff. Subsequently, PyRosetta 10 scripts were written to rank and identify the most stable complexes from each cluster which were then energy-minimized and re-ranked. Finally, the complex which ranked high in stability and binding scores was chosen as the model. An alanine scan was again performed using PyRosetta scripts, where the computational models of the alanine variants were first generated, energy minimized, and ACE2 binding scores computed. The ACE2 interface definitions for each binding partner (RBDs and ATR1) were obtained by feeding the energy minimized protein-protein complexes through the find_contacts module of OptMAVEn-2.0 11 .

"Abstract

A novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) was the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. Genomic analyses of nCoV-2019 determined a 96% resemblance with a coronavirus isolated from a bat in 2013 (RaTG13); however, the receptor binding motif (RBM) of these two genomes share low sequence similarity. This divergence suggests a possible alternative source for the RBM coding sequence in nCoV-2019. We identified high sequence similarity in the RBM between nCoV-2019 and a coronavirus genome reconstructed from a viral metagenomic dataset from pangolins possibly indicating a more complex origin for nCoV-

","

An outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) 1 , first identified in Wuhan China, has resulted in over twenty thousand confirmed cases worldwide (WHO Situation Report, February 5 2020). Data available to date has led to the hypothesis that the outbreak strain originated from bats. The nCoV-2019 has been reported to share 96% sequence identity to the RaTG13 genome, a coronavirus isolated from an intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) 2 . RaTG13 is the most closely related coronavirus genome to nCoV-2019, however other viral strains may have contributed to its genomic content. To explore this hypothesis, we examined several viral metagenomic datasets for potential coronaviruses that could harbor RBMs closer to nCoV-2019. We report evidence of a coronavirus recovered from a Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica) viral metagenomic dataset 3 that shares a higher sequence identity at a crucial segment of the genome involved in host infection ( Figure 1 ). This result indicates a potential recombination event and a more complex origin for the nCoV-2019 strain.The coronavirus spike protein is a trimeric protein that mediates virus entry into the host cell. It is composed of two domains: S1 and S2. The S1 domain contains two subdomains: S1-NTD and S1-CTD, also known as the receptor binding domain (RBD). The S2 domain encodes the stalk of the spike protein and is highly conserved across the SARS-like coronaviruses 4 . In order to infect a host cell, the RBD must first bind to a surface protein on the host cell. In the case of SARS-CoV and nCoV-2019, this is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, expressed in human airway epithelia as well as lung parenchyma among other tissues. Following RBD binding, the S1/S2 junction must be cleaved by a surface protease 4 . Zhou et al. (2020) 2 have reported noticeable decreased amino acid homology between the RBD of the spike protein in RaTG13 and nCoV-2019. A further analysis of the RBD in RaTG13 showed the majority of the divergence was restricted to amino acid residues 435 to 510 (75% nucleotide identity and 78% amino acid identity). This region corresponds to the receptor binding motif (RBM), which is responsible for host specificity. Such divergence at the RBM could indicate the possibility of an alternate source for the RBM coding sequence in nCoV-2019. To explore this, we examined several viral metagenomic datasets for potential coronaviruses that could harbor RBMs closer to nCoV-2019.Using VirMAP 5 , we aimed to reconstruct coronavirus genomes to compare recovered RBM sequences to that of nCoV-2019.

Data used in the study

Viral metagenomic datasets of hosts that could potentially harbor coronaviruses were downloaded from the NCBI BioProject database. These included PRJNA573298 3 (pangolin), PRJNA597258 (fruit bats) and PRJNA379515 (bats). The coronavirus genome (recovered from bat, GenBank accession number MG772933.1 6 ) reported to be the most homologous to the nCoV-2019 outbreak strain prior to the publication the RaTG13 (GenBank accession number MN996532) was also downloaded.

Analysis

Sequences from each project were trimmed (minimum quality score 20 and minimum length 75bp) and filtered for Illumina adapter and PhiX presence using bbduk.sh v38.71 7 . Prior to analysis all sequences were filtered against a the relevant host reference genome (pangolin ManJav1.0, PRJNA256023 or bat mRhiFer1_v1.p, PRJNA489106) using bbmap.sh v38.71(k=15 and minid=0.9) 7 . After trimming and filtering, sequence reads were processed using VirMAP 5 to obtain and identify coronavirus genomes present in the viral metagenomic dataset. Two coronavirus genomes sharing high homology to nCoV-2019 were recovered from the pangolin dataset in two samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378).The two genomes were merged using the easymerge.pl subcommand from VirMAP to create the final pangolin-associated coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV) genome.All further analysis was done using four coronaviruses genome sequences: Pangolin-CoV, RaTG13, Bat-CoV and nCoV-2019.

Distances of the selected coronavirus genomes relative to nCov-2019 were calculated using a 300bp window sliding every 10bp across the entire genome length. Sequence homology plots were visualized using R version 3.6.2 11 and the ggplot2 visualization package 12 . The RBM segments as well as the Pro-Arg-Arg-Ala (PRRA) amino acid insertion region were excised from the full genome and pairwise aligned on NCBI using blastn and blastx. Multiple alignments of the both these regions were done using MAFFT v7.313 13 and visualized with MEGAX v10.1.7 14 .

Results

Of the three viral metagenomic datasets inspected, only the pangolin dataset contained coronavirus genomes sharing significant homology with the outbreak strain. Two samples in this dataset yielded two partial coronavirus genomes that overlapped >8.4kb at >99% nucleotide identity with each other.After merging, the final Pangolin-CoV draft genome was 90.5% similar to nCoV-2019 (median nucleotide identity). Figure 1 shows the sequence homology of Pangolin-CoV, RaTG13-CoV and Bat-CoV relative to nCoV-2019 ( Figure 1A shows the homology across the entire genome length). The multiple alignments across the RBM segments revealed an 89% nucleotide ( Figure 1B ) and 98% amino acid identity ( Figure 1C ) of the Pangolin-CoV compared to nCoV-2019. The sequence homology plots showed that the Pangolin-CoV was more similar to nCoV-2019 at the RBD region than the RaTG13-CoV and Bat-CoV ( Figure 1B) . The multiple alignment comparing the PRRA insertion region at the S1/S2 junction shows the insertion present in nCoV-2019 and missing in the other three CoV genomes ( Figure 2 ).

Recent coronavirus zoonotic transmissions have involved non-bat intermediates. Indeed, both SARS 15

and MERS 16 are believed to have arisen from coronaviruses recombining in civet cats and camels, respectively.

A dataset describing the viral diversity in Malayan pangolins 3 yielded a coronavirus genome that shares 89% nucleotide ( Figure 1A and 1B) and 98% amino acid ( Figure 1C ) identity across the same RBM segment with nCoV-2019. Additionally, the RaTG13 genome only shares one out of five key amino acids involved in receptor binding motif 2 , whereas the pangolin coronavirus shares all five key residues ( Figure 1C) . It therefore appears that the RBM in nCoV-2019 was introduced during a recombination event between the strain of coronavirus found in the pangolin and RaTG13. Given the heavy selective pressure under which the RBM is constrained, it is unlikely that RaTG13 acquired the mutations found in the pangolin coronavirus genome through random chance. We posit that the homology at the RBM between nCoV-2019 and a pangolin coronavirus may have arisen from a recombination event based on sequence analysis presented herein.Amino acid alignment between pangolin coronavirus and nCoV-2019 at the S1-NTD subdomain results in low sequence similarity. However, increased similarity is observed from the RBD through the S2 domain ( Figure 1A-B) . This suggests a possible recombination event between a bat coronavirus and the pangolin coronavirus at the S1-NTD and RBD junction. While there is high conservation at the amino-acid level between the pangolin coronavirus and nCoV-2019, this is not reflected in the nucleotide identity, suggesting that the proposed recombination event occurred in the more distant past, allowing subsequent time for genetic drift. One such mutation could be the insertion of the amino acid residues PRRA near the S1/S2 junction which induces a furin cleavage motif. The secondary requirement for entry into the host cell is proteolytic cleavage of the S1/S2 domains in order to mediate membrane fusion post ACE2 binding 4 , and introduction of the furin cleavage motif may be another factor in nCoV-2019 being able to replicate in humans ( Figure 2 ). author/funder.

"Abstract

There is large uncertainty around the case fatality risk (CFR) for COVID-19 in China. Therefore, we considered symptomatic cases outside of China (countries/settings with 20+ cases) and the proportion who are in intensive care units (4.0%, 14/349 on 13 February 2020). Given what is known about CFRs for ICU patients with severe respiratory conditions from a meta-analysis, we estimated a CFR of 1.37% (95%CI: 0.57% to 3.

","

The new coronavirus appears to be fairly transmissible [1] , and is spreading in China. Disease severity is a particularly important parameter for understanding this new disease [1] , but unfortunately, the case fatality risk (CFR) data from China is difficult to interpret owing to likely missed mild cases (including due to a lack of appropriate test kits early in the epidemic) and also the likely delay in deaths occurring. Such a prolonged time course is suggested by a case series of 138 cases from Wuhan, China with cases enrolled between 1-28 January 2020. For this group on 3 February, 62% were still hospitalised and 31% (11/36) of those admitted to ICU were still there (6 had died) [2] .In jurisdictions outside China (and excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) the CFR as detailed in the 13 February WHO Report [3] was 1/447 = 0.22% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.40% to 1.26%). But this estimate also did not account for possible missed mild cases in those countries or the lag time between hospitalisation and death.One possible way to get a better estimate of the CFR is to consider the proportion of cases currently in intensive care units (ICUs) in settings outside China where the healthcare system is working relatively normally (ie, is not over-burdened by the epidemic). As per Table 1 we estimated that 4.0% (14/349) of identified cases were in ICUs in all the countries outside of China that had 20+ cases. When there were 23 known cases: ""all 22 patients currently isolated are in stable condition.""…""one patient was discharged from a hospital yesterday after he was cured"".

5/218 (see comments)

Based on a news report on 13 February [8] : ""Kato said five people from the ship are currently in serious condition in hospital"". A prior report on 12 February in the same news source gave more detail for the first four people where the Health Minister (Katsunobu Kato) was reported saying: ""At this point, we have confirmed that four people, among those who are hospitalised, are in a serious condition, either on a ventilator or in an intensive care unit."" [9] Total 4.0% (14/349) Next we considered the typical survival of people admitted to ICUs with severe respiratory conditions. We used data from a meta-analysis of trials comparing higher vs lower levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in adults with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [10] . This study found 374 hospital deaths in 1136 patients (32.9%) assigned to treatment with higher PEEP and 409 hospital deaths in 1163 patients (35.2%) assigned to lower PEEP (with no significant difference between these two groups). Combining these data suggests a CFR in such patients with acute lung injury of 34.1% (783/2299). This estimate is a little less than one case series of ICU patients with acute respiratory failure from Influenza A (H1N1) and requiring mechanical ventilation, who had a CFR of 46% (156/337) [11] . Another study of such ICU patients with influenza found a lower overall CFR of 26% (492/1859) [12] and another one reported a CFR of 24% (177/733) [13] . Furthermore, in a group of 340 ICU patients with ARDS, the CFR at 90 days was 32% in a group given a neuromuscular blocker and 41% in the placebo group [14] .We then applied the 34.1% value from the meta-analysis to the data in Table 1 , giving an estimated CFR of 1.37% ([14 x 34.1%]/349) for COVID-19. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of this estimate is 0.57% to 3.22%. This estimate can be considered a symptomatic CFR (sCFR) as it likely to be based on a denominator who had symptoms and were tested and laboratory-confirmed as cases. This estimate is almost invariably higher than the infectionfatality risk (IFR) which can only be estimated when serological testing becomes available to identify all of those infected [15] .Decision-makers and disease modellers might still be best to assume that the 'true' CFR is less than our estimate here as mild cases may not be identified. Furthermore, if a specific treatment is identified in the near future, then cases could have improved survival and the CFR might decline. On the other hand, if health systems became overloaded with the COVID-19 epidemic, then the CFR could likely increase for both the community and in hospital cases. As there is further progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, ongoing work will be needed to better clarify both transmissibility and the CFR, so that the likely mortality burden can be estimated. The method we have used here for CFR estimation will only be valid prior to healthcare systems becoming overloaded, after which they are likely to change their ICU admission policies.Our provisional CFR estimate for COVID-19 is less than that estimated for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is broadly comparable with two of the three previous influenza pandemics (when considering the range of estimated values) ( Table 2 ). These values could, however, be over-estimates given the possibility of mild cases not being detected (see main text). Pandemic influenza in 2009 0% to 1.2% (but mainly 0.05% to 0.005%)A systematic review considered 77 estimates from 50 published studies [19] . The values for symptomatic cases had point estimates ranging from 0 to 1,200 per 100,000 cases. Nevertheless, ""most of the estimates in this category [symptomatic cases] fell in the range of 5 to 50 deaths per 100,000 cases.""

"Abstract

About one month after the COVID-19 epidemic peaked in Mainland China and SARS-CoV-2 migrated to Europe and then the U.S., the epidemiological data begin to provide important insights into the risks associated with the disease and the effectiveness of intervention strategies such as travel restrictions and social distancing. Respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, remain only about two months in any given population, although peak incidence and lethality can vary. The epidemiological data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, Italy, and Italy's neighbors were hit by the more dangerous ""SKII"" variant. While the epidemic in continental Asia is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the more recent epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing, albeit not exponentially anymore. The peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the U.S. first. The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help us to choose prevention strategies. Containment of high-risk people, like the elderly, and reducing disease severity, either by vaccination or by early treatment of complications, is the best strategy against a respiratory virus disease. Social distancing or ""lockdowns"" can be effective during the month following the peak incidence in infections, when the exponential increase of cases ends. Earlier containment of low-risk people merely prolongs the time the virus needs to circulate until the incidence is high enough to initiate ""herd immunity"". Later containment is not helpful, unless to prevent a rebound if containment started too early.

","Introduction

The first cases of a new coronavirus strain, termed SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (Cascella 2020) , were reported on 31-12-2019 in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province of China. (Jernigan 2020) As of 2020-03-31, 10:00 CET, 777,798 symptomatic cases and 37,272 deaths have been reported from virtually every country in the northern hemisphere (see Section Data), The disease was termed COVID-19 by the WHO on 2020-02-11, and categorized as a pandemic on 2020-03-12, yet the details of the spread and their implications for prevention have not been discussed in sufficient detail. Between 02-14 and 03-16, the Dow Jones fell 31% from 29,440 to 20,188, raising fears for the economy, in general, and retirement savings, in particular. Several administrations have imposed severe restrictions aimed at containment of the virus. For instance,• On 03-08, the Italian government imposed a quarantine on 16 million people in the north of Italy, which was followed up on 03-11 with a nationwide closure of all restaurants and bars along with most stores. (WSJ, 2020-03-11) • on 03-11, the U.S. administration banned travel from 26 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland). https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-12-20intl-hnk/index.html .• On 03-15, New York's Mayor de Blasio reversed his previous position that NY schools should remain open to avoid health care workers from ""staying home and watching their children"" and announced NY public schools to be closed, following many other school systems.• From 03-17, all New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut restaurants were had to close. From 03-22, hairdressers and barbers were also closed.• From 03-19 California was ""shut down"". • On 03-22, the lockdown in the Italian region of Lombardy was tightened to ban sports and other physical activity, as well as the use of vending machines.• Also, on 03-22, the National Guard was activated in New York, California, and Washington State, five senators self-quarantined. NY governor Cuomo mandated that all nonessential businesses close or work from home.By the end on 03-20, the Dow Jones was down at 19,173 (35%) from 02-14. On 03-26, the U.S. Senate approved a $2T stimulus package.For most of the first three months of the epidemic, much of the response was driven by ""fear, stigma, or discrimination"" (Ren 2020) , including naming SARS-CoV-2 the ""China virus"" (Rogers 2020) , despite the fact that seasonal respiratory zoonotic pathogens typically originate in China, where lifeanimal markets provide chances for animal viruses to transmit to humans. (Malik 2020) After three months, enough data are available to discuss important epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and the potential impact of interventions. In particular, we have now seen the number of new cases (and deaths) to decline in China and South Korea and to at least stabilize in some European countries. Changes in number of deaths follow the changes in number cases (albeit at a lower level) by about two weeks. Hence, we can discuss both the infectiousness and the lethality of the virus, two important characteristics to assess public health impact of the disease.One of the key findings published herein is evidence that at least two strains of SARS-CoV-2 with different infectiousness and lethality have evolved, and by following the likely path for each of these strains we can obtain novel insights into the nature of the epidemic and, thus, the effectiveness of prevention strategies. Another finding is that the timepoint when a public health intervention starts in the course of the epidemic (especially the ""turning point"" where the increase in new cases begins to decline) is crucial for the impact of the intervention. 

Methods and models Statistical and Bioinformatics Methods

The data were processed with MS Excel. To avoid biases from inappropriate model assumptions only basic descriptive statistics were employed. In some cases, data from only the day before or after (or both) was averaged (up to a three day moving average) to reduce the effects of apparent reporting artifacts (Darwin's natura non facit saltum, (Berry 1985) ) without creating undue biases. The two ""smoothers"" applied were:• averaging x0 with a previous x−1 (or, rarely, following x+1) data and• applying a moving average of (x−1, x0, x+1)→(2 x−1 + x0, x−1 + x0 + x+1, x0 +2 x+1)/3No other changes were applied to the data.Like China in mid-February, the German Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) changed the reporting system in mid-March, which resulted in a near 6-fold increase of the data reported on 03-20 over the data reported on 03-19. Such changes in reporting systems add to the difficulties in interpreting the data.

Epidemiological Models

If a disease causes immunity after an infectious period of a few days only, like respiratory diseases, an epidemic extinguishes itself as the proportion of immune people increases. Under the SIR model, (Kermack 1991) for a reproduction number (Dietz 1993) (secondary infections by direct contact in a susceptible population) of R0=1.5-2.5 over 7 days (recovery rate: γ=1/7=.14), the noticeable part of the epidemic lasts about 90-45 days (R0/γ=β=.21-.36) in a homogeneous population of 10M. The period is shorter for smaller more homogenous and longer for larger, more heterogenous populations. For a given infectious period 1/γ (here, e.g., 7 days. SARS and COVID-19 incubation period plus 2 days (Lauer 2020) ), R0 also determines how long it will take for early cases to become visible after a single import (150-60 days), the peak prevalence of infections (5-22%), and how many people will become immune (55-90%). To allow for comparisons between models, an arbitrary proportion of symptomatic cases among those becoming infected (.05%) is used and 2% of cases are assumed to die. The model reflects that the key milestones of the epidemic, the turning point/half maximal point in infections (red, day 68), the turning point/half maximal point in the number of cases (day 75, orange), the peak in infections (day 83, red), the peak in cases (day 70, orange) and the peak in deaths (day 77, gray) follow each other, following the previous milestone after about a week. Table 1 shows the raw daily incidence by population sizes for countries with epidemiological relevance in the northern hemisphere. Countries within proximity are grouped by their peak incidence (red background).

Incidence by Country. Norther Hemisphere

The Hubei province in China (with the capital Wuhan), South Korea, Iran, Italy (especially the Lombardy region), and Spain have the highest peak incidence, followed by the countries neighboring Italy.It should be noted, however, that there is no uniform definition of ""cases"". In some countries a case needs to have symptoms, in other countries, it suffices to have antibodies (be immune)..

Time-course by country/region

Among the Hubei population of 58.5M, the incidence rose from the first case reported in late 2019 to about 60 new cases per million people per day by 02-05 and then steadily declined (Fig 1) from ~4000 on 02-05 to below 50 cases per day since 03-08. Most cases were seen in the Hubei province of 58.5M people (see Table 1 for population sizes).By Mid-January 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were seen in other Asian countries, but incidence remained below about 3/M/d outside of continental China, although Malaysia/Brunei, Singapore, and the Philippines have been rising to about 5/M/d. Japan, instead, with the largest proportion of people >65 years of age in the world (28%) remains below 1.5/M/d. Still, the upward curvature (Fig 3) might indicate an emerging epidemic with no indication of a turning point, yet. In continental South Korea (population 51M, cumulative incidence 192/M), however, the incidence soon rose to a peak of about 14/M/d between 02-29 and 03-02, before declining to less than 150 cases per day (2.5/M/d) since 03-12 (Fig 2a) .In Iran (cumulative incidence 385/M), incidence rose about a week after South Korea. The top incidence before 03-23 (~15.5 cases/M/d) was about the same. The increase thereafter to 35-40M/d may indicate a ""rebound"" into a population not sufficiently immunized by the previous wave(s). Lethality in Iran was notably higher and followed the increase in cases with the expectel delay of several days (Fig 2b) . Maritime Asia .

As natura non facit saltum (Darwin: nature doesn't jump), (Berry 1985) such abrupt increases must be, at least in part, the result of reporting or other artifacts. In Germany, for instance, the reporting system was changed between 03-16 and 03-19, so that the number likely includes cases previously reported only through a parallel system. France, Italy, and Spain also reported an unusual increase by 27-35 percent. Since 3-26, all these countries reported the incidence to decline. Iran .

Data in Germany is based on cases reported electronically to the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) and transmitted to the ECDC, but the RKI also provides two sources of data on its Web site that are difficult to reconcile with these data.Of particular interest is Sweden, where no ""social distancing"" policy was implemented. Still, there was no difference in the shape of the epidemic or the height of its peak to the other Scandinavian countries: The epidemic in North America started later, especially in the US (except for a few isolated cases likely imported directly from Asia). The increase in incidence is consistent with the dynamics of an earlier epidemic and the cumulative incidence in the US (497/M) is still lower than in Europe (747/M). The US may have reached the ""turning point"", where the rate of new cases begins to decline (when 50% of the peak incidence is reached) at about 03-26, compared to Europe's 03-22. Reporting in Canada is not consistent enough to draw conclusions, although levels may remain below those in the U.S. Even in New York City, which is particularly hard hit, the number of new cases seem to be leveling off, albeit the number of deaths is still increasing, indicating an extremely high lethality approaching 25%, even higher than Italy's. .

As in Canada and, earlier, in Germany and other European countries, isolated spikes tend to reflect delayed reporting, rather than changes in incident trends. The number of deaths (20/5204 = 0.4%) is extremely low (Fig 10) . 

Modeling Results for Effectiveness of Containment (Social Distancing)

The effect of reducing the reproduction number by reducing the number of contacts (""containment"", ""Social Distancing"") depends on when it starts in the course of the epidemic. Fig 11 shows the effect of a one-month intervention cutting R0 in half starting at the point of the peak prevalence of infectious subjects. Compared to Fig 1, the duration of the epidemic is shortened, albeit at the price of reducing the R/S ratio, so that a subsequent epidemic with the same or a similar virus (cross-immunity) could start earlier.

This intervention reduces the number of deaths, but the epidemic is extinguished two months later and the R/S ratio (""herd immunity"") is further decreased. Fig 12. Even if the intervention is extended from one to four months no herd immunity is created and, thus, the epidemic rebounds and will run eight months, instead of three (Fig 1) or less (Fig 11) . 1 for legend) . It is assumed that a highly effective intervention reduces R0 by 50% for 4 months, beginning after the appearance of a novel type of cases is noticed. The proportion of symptomatic cases (0.05%/d, i.e., .35% of infected people will become cases and the proportion of cases to die (2%) may change, but the issues discussed here are broadly independent of these assumptions.

The curve goes down, but is not ""flattened"".• Starting at the peak prevalence gives the epidemic a ""coup de grace"", shortening its duration, albeit at the price of reducing the R/S ratio. The curve is narrower, but also not ""flattened"" (Fig 11) .• Starting at the peak incidence ""flattens"" the curve without broadening it and maximizes the number of deaths prevented during the current epidemic, but reduces herd immunity and, thus, the chance of another epidemic coming sooner (Fig 12) .• Starting before the peak incidence ""flattens the curve"", but also broadens it and causes a rebound, unless the intervention is continued for many more months (Fig 13) .It is herd immunity that stops the spread of an infectious disease, so in general, one would want to let the epidemic initially run its natural course (or even accelerate it, as people have traditionally done with ""measles parties"") to build immunity as fast as possible.To reduce the duration of the epidemic and its impact on the economy (and also increase the time until the next epidemic can spread), one would wait until the prevalence of infectious people (I) reaches its peak (in the above model: day 83, red).Without repeated broad testing, however, this date cannot be directly observed, but it is known that peak prevalence of infected people is followed about a week by peak number of new cases. This is too late to make a decision, but the SIR model shows that this peak is preceded by two weeks by the ""turning point"" in cases where the curve of the new cases changes from increasing faster to increasing more slowly (day 76). The turning point can be estimated from the observed cases in time to making a decision. (It is also about 50% of the peak number of new cases, which one might be able to predict.) Hence, peak prevalence (of infections) follows the turning point/half peak (in number of cases) by about a week. The window of opportunity for starting an intervention is the week following the turning point in number of cases per day.

Strengths and shortcomings

A major strength of this analysis of the epidemiological data is that it does not rely on epidemiological models with questionable assumptions. Instead, the results reflect raw incidences over time as reported by the ECDC, depicted by country or region of neighboring countries.A shortcoming of such an entirely data-based approach is that it lacks the sophistication and potential additional insights that could come from fitting, e.g., differential equation models. The only modeling assumption made is that curves should be ""smooth"" (except when reporting artifacts are suspected), but even then, data were redistributed only to the directly neighboring day.Still, the evidence is strong enough to draw qualitative conclusions about possible scenarios for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the near future. Also, the results suggest strategies to explore the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus strains and to select prevention strategies..

Evidence for (at least) two different strains of SARS-CoV-2

During the 2003 SARS epidemic the number of new cases peaked about three weeks after the initial increase of cases was noticed and then declined by 90% within a month. Table 1 shows the relevant timepoints for the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic. The SARS-C0V-2 data also suggest that it takes at least a month from the first case entering the country (typically followed by others) for the epidemic to be detected, about three weeks for the number of cases to peak and a month for the epidemic to ""resolve"". This data is consistent with the results from the SIR model (see Epidemiological Models). (Small 2003; Yeh 2004) Singapore 03-15 20 04-05 24 04-29 44 (Small 2003; Goh 2006) Vietnam 02-23 11 03-04 28 04-06 39 (Shi 2003) Median 2003 The 2003 SARS and the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 are not only similar with respect to genetics (79% homology), (Lu 2020) immunology, (Ahmed 2020) involvement of endocytosis (also with influenza and syncytial viruses), (Behzadi 2019) seasonal variation (same season in the northern hemisphere also with influenza, syncytial, and metapneumo viruses) (Olofsson 2011) , evolution (origin in bats, 88% homology), (Benvenuto 2020; Malik 2020) but also with respect to the duration between emergence and peak of cases as well as between this peak and resolution of the epidemic (Table 1) . Based on these similarities, one could predict the COVID-19 epidemic to end before 04-15 in Europe and about two weeks later in the U.S.The time and height of the peak incidence of cases in the different countries are consistent with the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 moved step-by-step westward from China, via other Asian countries to Middle East (Iran. Qatar, and Bahrain), Southern Europe (Italy, followed by its neighbors CH/F/ES/AT/SI), central and northern Europe, and, finally, the US.Viruses improve their ""survival"" if they develop strategies to coexist with the (human) host. (Woolhouse 2007) Multiple coronaviruses have been found to coexist in bat populations. (Ge 2016) The emerging COVID-19 data is consistent with the hypothesis that (at least) two SARS-CoV-2 strains have developed. One strain, which traveled through South Korea, remained more infectious, while the . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/ 10.1101 10. /2020 other strain, which traveled through other Asian countries lost more of its infectiousness. The strain that passing through South Korea and then Iran and Italy (SKII strain) showed high lethality in Iran and Italy, but less lethality when it traveled to Italy's neighbors, either because of differences in health systems, because the strain mutated back, or because a strain arriving directly from Asia had the advantage of spreading first. Only sequencing samples from these countries can help to answer these questions. 

Changes in infectivity and lethality between China and Europe

Mainland China is not reporting relevant numbers of novel cases anymore and Hubei reports no new cases since 03-19. The number of new cases in South Korea also has declined to low levels since its peak around 02-30. Maritime Southeast Asia continues to show low levels of new cases only (<3/M/d), with the possible exception of Singapore and Malaysia/Brunei. Japan and the Philippines are slowly approaching a 2/M/d incidence.The data are consistent with the same ""SKII"" strain traveling from China via South Korea and Iran to Italy. Iran was hit about a week after South Korea (around 03-07), with a similar peak incidence, but higher lethality (red bars in Fig 2) . The data also suggests a second wave of infections in Iran, which may have peaked on 03-15. Italy was hit a week after the first wave in Iran (which peaked around 03-07/08, Fig 4a) . Incidence in Italy reached a substantially higher incidence than reported in Iran. The peak incidence in Italy may have been reached on 03-22 (at about 100/M/d).Without sufficiently detailed genetic data, it is not clear whether the high lethality in Italy is due to genetic variations in the virus or to Italy having the second oldest populations in the world (after Japan). A 03-20 report by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, (COVID-19 Surveillance Group 2020) however, implicates that age and comorbidities played a role -among 3200 deaths, mostly in Lombardy and Emilia-Romana, median age was 80 years (IQR 73-85, only were 36 below the age of 50), 98.8% had at least one comorbidity (hypertension: 74%, diabetes: 34%, ischemic heart disease: 30%, atrial fibrillation, 22%, chronic renal failure: 20%, …).The epidemiological data does not support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 spread from Munich in Germany to Italy. (Kupferschmidt 2020) Instead, the virus may have spread from Italy to its neighboring . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101 preprint . https://doi.org/10. /2020 countries, Switzerland, France, Spain, Austria, and Slovenia, within just a few days of arriving from Iran. The top incidence seems to be less than half of that in Italy and the lethality is lower, too. While Italy has many people 65 years and older (23%, second only to Japan data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP. 65UP . TO.ZS ) , the relatively small differences or age distribution within Europe (e.g., Germany: 21%) are unlikely to account for much of this difference. A possible explanation (indicated in Fig 6) is that the less virulent strain(s) arriving from other parts of Asia may have had a head start in those countries, so that imported infections from Italy met subjects who had already developed (cross) resistance against both strains.The parts of Europe not directly hit by the SKII strain leveled off at (about 40/M/d). Overall, incidence in Europe seems to have leveled off at about 60/M/d (and recent reporting irregularities seem to have less of an effect). There is strong evidence for incidence now decreasing.

Predictions for COVID-19 in North America

From Table 1 , SARS-CoV-2 has arrived in the U.S. almost a week after it arrived in Europe. The incidence is still low (currently at about 60/M/d) but already shows signs of leveling off. If incidence in the U.S. were to peak at about 75/M/d, higher than Europe as a whole, but less than Italy and its neighbors (Fig 4) , one would expect new cases to peak at up to 25,000 per day and the cumulative incidence could reach 600/M (3 times the number of cases per million people in South Korea to account for a longer course because of the size of the countries) or a total of 200,000 cases, and, at twice of the currently the observed 1.7% lethality in the US (compared to South Korea's 1.5%), about 6,000 deaths, 2,502 of which have already been reported. In South-Korea, the epidemic there completed its course, economy and political system are comparable to the US, and the proportion of people older than 65 years is similar (14% vs 16%). On the other hand, the numbers could double if the SKII strain should have hit the US as the first strain. A number of 6000-12000 U.S. death over the course of the epidemic compares to an expected number of 16,000-78,000 influenza deaths per season from pneumonia and respiratory/circulatory complications alone, which also occur predominantly among people at 65 years of age and older. (Rolfes 2018) . The precise number of people dying depends on (a) which virus strain got to the US first and (b) how early people are being treated against severe complications (e.g., pneumonia).

A historical perspective

This is not the first, and likely not the last time, that well-intentioned public health policies are inconsistent with our understanding of how epidemics spread. For instance, during much of the HIV epidemic, there was widespread fear that HIV could establish itself in the population as a whole, even though the data (including data showing absence of transmission to the wives of hemophiliacs) (Wittkowski 1995a) and models (Wittkowski 1992; Seydel 1994) contradicted this fear. (Wittkowski 1995b; 1996) These results have been repeatedly confirmed. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019; Haddad 2019) In the case of heterosexual transmission of HIV one could argue that there was little risk associated with a the public health policy promoting condom use, but in the case of COVID-19 prevention, ignoring models and data may carry substantial risk.During the AIDS epidemic, epidemiologists had the advantage that, in addition to the date of report, the date of diagnosis was available for analysis so that variations in reporting delays, such as mid-February in China, 03-20 in Germany, and 03-26 in Canada, could be accounted for. Unfortunately, the public COVID-19 data lacks that information..

Case data for New York City is inconsistent, but the New York Times reports that New York and Detroit reached the turning point on 03-19. Under this assumption, the optimal time point for starting a New York public health intervention to reduce duration and impact of the COVID-19 epidemic was around 03-27. Social distancing in NY, one of the epicenters of the U.S. epidemic, started about 03-17 (day 73 in the model) with restaurants being closed, and intensified on 03-22 (day 78) with all non-essential businesses being closed. Restrictions have been discussed to be lifted on 04-12 (day 100, because of the Easter holiday) or 04-30 (day 117). The model predicts that an intervention until Easter would reduce the number of deaths in New York and Detroit (and possibly some other parts of the U.S., but the virus would still linger on for another three months, so that it would not be safe for (elderly) high-risk people to participate in this year's Easter activities. Extending the social distancing until the end of April would substantially reduce, but not eliminate, the number of infectious people remaining in the population (Fig 15) . .

Conclusions

Until a vaccine will become available, the only pharmacological strategy to reduce the number of deaths is to reduce the damage the infection (and immune system) does, e.g., by reducing the initial viral load, (Chu 2004) and making sure that people get treated at the earliest signs of pneumonia.As the curve of new cases is flattening in the U.S. at about 20,000 per day and the proportion of cases dying is stabilizing at ~2% (with regional differences), the number of deaths is stabilizing at about 400/d (a quarter of them in NYC) and beginning to decrease (a worldwide characteristic of COVID-19) with a one-week delay. With an expected total of less than 10,000 deaths, social distancing may have saved 1000 deaths at a cost of $2T ($2B per case) so far, but prolonging the epidemic may also have increased the number of deaths, because preventing exposure of young people early on means that more of the elderly become infected before herd immunity is reached.Aside from separating susceptible populations (elderly and high-risk subjects, e.g., in nursing homes) from the epidemic, which is effective as long as virus is circulating, public health intervention aiming to contain a respiratory disease need to start within a narrow window of opportunity starting at or a week after the curve of the new cases changes from increasing faster to increasing more slowly. Only if stopping the epidemic from generating a sufficient number of immune people is avoided can containment efforts stop after about a month or two (depending on late or early start, respectively), when the ratio of infectious vs immune people is low enough for preventing the disease from rebounding. When the window of opportunity has been missed, containment has only limited impact on the course of the epidemic, but high impact on economy and society.As epidemics in maritime Asia and"
"Abstract

Many trials are now underway to inform decision-makers on potential effects of treatments for COVID-19.

","Introduction

Evidence for effective treatments to defeat COVID-19 is needed -fast. The number of registered randomized trials studying promising antiviral drugs is rising steadily. To ensure timely availability and evaluation of the results, it is essential that the studies are comparable. At the same time, the manifold ways treatment may have a beneficial effect need to be assessed and sufficient information for all decision makers must be provided (1, 2) . Thus, while a number of different endpoints is of major interest, comprehensive judgement is only possible if treatment effects on the various endpoints are presented simultaneously.The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative is currently working on a core outcome set (COS) for COVID-19 randomized trials (3) . In this manuscript, we propose a multistate model that harmonizes the multiplicity of endpoints while allowing for a detailed understanding of treatment effect (4, 5) . Thus, we do not aim at giving recommendation on suitable endpoints, but rather on additional statistical analysis that provides major insights for endpoints within, for example, the COS of COMET.First, we provide a exemplarily overview of endpoints currently used in COVID-19 trials. To do so, we reviewed the primary endpoints of clinical trials registered in the database of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (6) . We restricted the review to Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine which are currently among the most promising treatment options for COVID-19. Then, we explain the multistate model approach. Even though the endpoints-review is restricted to a small number of treatments the proposed multistate methods apply equally to other COVID-19 clinical trials.

Endpoints

We reviewed clinical COVID-19 trials to provide an overview of the primary endpoints used to analyze treatment effects. We included all randomized trials registered by March 27, 2020 in the clinical trial database of the NLM at the NIH with the primary purpose to study the efficacy of Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir or Hydroxychloroquine as treatment for COVID-19 diseased patients (6) .We found 23 trials that met the inclusion criteria. Of these trials, we extracted and categorized the definition of the primary endpoint. Moreover, we collected details on duration of follow-up, sample size and the patient population under study (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ).Five of the trials study Remdesivir, seven study Lopinavir/ritonavir and six study Hydroxychloroquine. Moreover, there are three trials studying both Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine, one studying Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine and one involving all of the three treatments.The main part of the registered trials (n=9) uses a recovery outcome as primary endpoint. However, definition of recovery and duration of follow-up differ substantially between trials. Seven of these trials do not provide a precise clinical definition of their primary endpoint. Among those that provide more details, clinical recovery is defined in different ways. Follow-up in trials with recovery as endpoint ranges from 14 to 168 days with most trials (n=5) having a follow-up of 28 or 30 days. Generally, follow-up ranges from four to 168 days. Most trials (n=16) have a follow-up of 14 to 15 days (n=6 and 5 respectively) or 28 days (n=5). Other outcomes are discharge (n=1), clinical worsening (n=2), mortality (n=3) and viral load (n=3; this includes one study with two primary endpoints).When using a recovery endpoint, it is important to differentiate between community-acquired and hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection. Currently, cases in randomized trials are comprised of community-acquired infections. However, it cannot be excluded that in the near future hospitalacquired COVID-19 randomized trials will be necessary. Definition of recovery from COVID-19 in critically ill patients is complex and highly subjective due to the infeasibility to differentiating symptoms from COVID-19 and the initial illness (2).The WHO R&D Blueprint expert group (7) recommends to use a categorical endpoint ranging from full recovery to death. For example, based on this recommendation Cao et al. (8) chose their primary endpoint as the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. The seven-category ordinal scale of Cao et al. (8) consists of the following categories: 1, not hospitalized with resumption of normal activities; 2, not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities; 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4, hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5, hospitalized, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or both; 6, hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both; and 7, death. Six of the registered clinical trials use such a categorical endpoint. The number of categories varies between six and eight states.Robust endpoints ensuring assessment of information for clinicians as well as public health authorities are duration of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization and mortality. Six (23%) studies consider mechanical ventilation in the primary endpoint and eight (35%) in the secondary endpoint. Similarly, hospitalization is included in the primary endpoint in seven (30%) of the studies and six (23%) in the secondary endpoint. Sixteen (70%) of the studies indicate that information on mortality is recorded (n=10, 43%) primary endpoint, (n=6, 23%, secondary endpoint). For other studies it is unclear whether this information is available. However, it can be presumed that more trials will record this information.The heterogeneity in choice of endpoints reflects the manifold potential treatment effects, the various different decision makers involved and the different patient populations under study. Nonetheless, harmonization of the different endpoints is an essential step to fasten decision making of public health authorities and clinicians (2) . At the same time, information on treatment effects should not be lost by oversimplification. Our proposal for harmonizing endpoints between and also within trials is based on information about major clinical events available in most of the registered clinical trials, namely mechanical ventilation, hospitalization and mortality.

Statistical guidelines to analyze COVID-19 clinical trials

The categorical endpoint recommended by the WHO R&D Blueprint expert group (7) ensures detailed collection of information on a range of important events. Nonetheless, a single estimate for the treatment effect -albeit an important summary of the benefit on the primary outcome -does not provide sufficient information. All time-dynamic aspects of the treatment must be understood in detail to make well-informed decisions. In light of the emergency, it is essential to exploit the full potential of all the available data to be able to report on all potential treatment effects.Multistate methodology is a powerful tool to study clinically opposite endpoints (mortality, discharge) as well as endpoints influencing hospital capacities (duration of hospitalization and ventilation) simultaneously over time (9, 10) . Duration of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization as well as mortality are robust endpoints providing important information for all decision makers.To obtain a detailed understanding of potential treatment effects, we propose the multistate model shown in Figure 1 For clinical trials that have already been started, we highly recommend to provide the stacked probability plots. Specifically clinical trials using the categorical endpoints recommended by the WHO R&D Blueprint expert group have all the necessary information available for this detailed analysis.For the planning of novel trials, we urgently suggest to analyze the available data with the multistate model. Etiology of treatment can be additionally studied with cause-specific Cox regression for all possible transitions in the model (12) . Differences in duration of hospitalization and time spent under mechanical ventilation between treatment and control group can be modelled with the transition probabilities of the multistate model (13) . The model avoids common pitfalls such as competing risks bias when studying hospital mortality and immortal time bias when considering mechanical ventilation (14) .A model that allows for more detailed information of treatment effect in mild and moderate cases is shown in Figure 3 . Analysis of the model in Figure 3 is in principle the same as for the model in Figure  1 . Treatment effects on being in one of the states at a particular time point can be visualized with the stacked probability plot and quantified with cause-specific hazard ratios for all possible transitions in the multistate model. Explanations on multistate model analysis and software are available in the literature (4, 5, 12, (15) (16) (17) .

Discussion

Our review of registered interventional COVID-19 trials revealed high heterogeneity in the definition of primary endpoints. Most of the studies used a recovery endpoint for the primary analysis. We propose to accompany the primary analysis with multistate methodology. We highlight, that literature provides an extensive statistical tool box of suitable models to analyze clinical trials. All ongoing clinical trials, especially those with severe cases, should accommodate primary analysis with a stacked probability plot of the major events mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death. The resulting informative plot is a powerful tool to harmonize the diversity of clinical endpoints and lengths of follow-up and thereby fastening accessibility of evidence and thus decision making. Additionally, treatment effects on a number of (potentially clinically opposite) endpoints can be studied simultaneously over time using cause-specific Cox regression and by estimating sojourn time spent in the various states. Moreover, while mechanical ventilation, hospitalization and mortality are objective outcomes, recovery and other states of severity are influenced by clinical judgement and may be additionally subject to measurement errors.Besides these potentials, both of the proposed multistate models have the limitation that they do not account for patient triage possibly necessitated by ICU congestion (19). Additional research is needed to avoid selection bias arising from this special clinical situation. Finally, our proposal should be understood as a complement for the primary analysis. Rather than suggesting COS for COVID-19 trials, we provide a way for simultaneous evaluation of multiple endpoints within COS using information all of the available data.To conclude, we recommend to complement the primary analysis with a stacked probability plot for the clinical events mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death. Figure 1 . The plot is based on a simulated data setting and illustrates for the treatment and respectively control group the probability to be mechanically ventilated, hospitalized without ventilation, discharged alive and dead over the course of time.All rights reserved.

"Abstract

Identifying viruses and phages in a metagenomics sample has important implication in improving human health, preventing viral outbreaks, and developing personalized medicine. With the rapid increase in data files generated by next generation sequencing, existing tools for identifying and annotating viruses and phages in metagenomics samples suffer from expensive running time. In this paper, we developed a standalone pipeline, FastViromeExplorer, for rapid identification and abundance quantification of viruses and phages in big metagenomic data. Both real and simulated data validated FastViromeExplorer as a reliable tool to accurately identify viruses and their abundances in large data, as well as in a time efficient manner.

","Introduction

Identifying the kinds of viruses that infect eukaryotes and prokaryotes (phages) and understanding their functions are important because they are the most abundant entities on Earth [18] . Even in a healthy human body, there are estimated to be 100 times more viral particles than eukaryotic cells [7] . Studies have shown that there are connections between human gut microbiome (viruses and bacteria) and diseases such as diabetes [6] and depression [8] and cancer [31] . Moreover, recent emerging viral outbreaks including Zika outbreak in Brazil [3] , Ebola in West Africa [4, 9] , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [10] , SARS, influenza-A caused tens of thousands of human deaths. To better understand and eventually prevent such viral outbreaks, it is critical to have timely identification and annotation of viruses. Traditional techniques of virus identification rely on isolation and clone culturing, which is not only time-consuming but often infeasible as many viruses and their hosts are difficult to cultivate in laboratories. Thanks to the fast development of biotechnology, it is now easy and quick to produce metagenomics data for a direct analysis of genetic materials to identify viruses and their abundances in various environments [11] .However, with the ease of metagenomics data generation also comes the challenge of downstream data analysis, including the computational identification of viral species and their abundances in a fast yet accurate manner from hundreds of millions/billions of short sequences. Strategies to identify and annotate viruses vary among different tools, ranging from analyzing marker genes, binning sequences or reads into taxonomic groups, assembling sequences into contigs and then annotating the taxonomy using the contigs, to directly aligning short reads to a reference database and inferring virus types and abundances based on the alignment results. The most straightforward and fastest approach for virus taxonomic annotation is to align short reads to a marker gene database and identify viruses based on the alignments, for example, MetaPhlAn [26] and its updated version MetaPhlAn2 [29] use this approach. However, marker gene analysis strategy does not work well when the input data contain species that do not have known marker genes. Comparatively, assembling reads into longer contigs and then performing the taxonomic analysis with contigs tend to produce more accurate results [21] . This type of virus analysis pipelines normally requires the users to assemble the reads using an independent assembler and then annotates the assembled contigs (e.g., VirSorter [22] , Metavir [23] , Metavir2 [24] , and Virome [30] ). Understandably the assembly of short reads into contigs gives longer sequences including longer coding regions with more informative content, which leads to improved annotation and downstream analysis. However, read assembly can be very time-consuming for large metagenomics data and can also generate chimeras (i.e., sequences from different genomes that are incorrectly assembled together due to their similarity) that mislead downstream annotation. Finally, tools such as MG-RAST [16] , ViromeScan [20] , VIP [15] , and HoloVir [12] directly align short reads to a reference database of whole genomes for taxonomy annotation. Many of these tools were initially developed for bacteria but adapted later for viruses and tend to work poorly due to the much smaller reference databases available for viruses than for bacteria [7] . In addition, as many virus annotation tools (i.e., Metavir [23] , Metavir2 [24] , Virome [30] , MG-RAST [16] ) are web-based, users need to upload their data to the website and wait for a long time to get results.To provide fast and accurate virus annotation on metagenomics data, we developed a stand-alone pipeline, FastViromeExplorer. Instead of the traditional read alignment tools such as BLAST [1] or Bowtie2 [13] , FastViromeExplorer uses kallisto [2] , a pseudoalignment based approach originally developed for alignment and quantification of RNA-seq data, to rapidly map short reads to a reference virus database. Then it filters the alignment results and reports virus types and abundances along with taxonomic annotation. To test the performance of FastViromeExplorer, we used simulated datasets of a known mixture of viral, phage, and bacterial genomes with different error/mutation rates. We also applied FastViromeExplorer to real metagenome datasets generated from a Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) experiment [14] . FastViromeExplorer is directly compared with the gold standard tool Blastn, and with ViromeScan [20] , a recently developed read based annotation tool for eukaryotic viruses.FastViromeExplorer is freely available at https://code.vt.edu/saima5/FastViromeExplorer.

Methods

FastViromeExplorer, written in Java, has two main steps, (1) the read mapping step where all reads are mapped to a reference database, and (2) the filtering step where the mapping results are subjected to three major filters (detailed later) for output of the final annotation results on virus types and abundances. The input of the read alignment step is raw reads (single-end or paired-end) in fastq format. FastViromeExplorer uses the reference database downloaded from NCBI containing 8,957 RefSeq viral genomes as default but can also use any updated or customized databases as reference. A pre-computed kallisto index file, generated for the 8,957 genomes, is distributed with FastViromeExplorer.First, FastViromeExplorer calls kallisto [2] as a subprocess to map the input reads against the reference database. Kallisto was developed to map RNA-seq data to a reference transcriptome (all the transcripts for a genome) leveraging the pseudoalignment process and estimate the abundance of the transcripts using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [5] . As there is no actual sequence alignment of the entire read over the reference sequences, the pseudoalignment process enables read mapping to be both lightweight and superfast. For example, kallisto was able to map and quantify 30 million paired-end RNA-seq reads for the human transcriptome in less than 10 minutes on a small laptop computer with a 1.3-GHz processor [2] . In addition to the ultrafast speed, kallisto also gives accurate estimation of abundance of each transcript or reference sequence [25, 28] . Consequently, kallisto could provide an ideal tool for virus type and abundance annotation in metagenomics samples that commonly have tens of millions of reads, mapping of which using commonly used programs such as BLAST can be time-consuming and often infeasible without computer clusters. Therefore, FastViromeExplorer deploys kallisto for the purpose of read mapping and abundance estimation of the annotated viruses. The k-mer size in kallisto can be altered depending on user's need, and experiments have shown that the default size 31 works well for metagenomics data and is therefore kept as default also in FastViromeExplorer.After the first alignment step, FastViromeExplorer takes the output of kallisto that includes information of the aligned reads together with estimated abundances or estimated read counts of all the identified viruses for the processing of the second step. The second step filters the output of the first step using three criteria, introduced to ensure the annotation quality and especially to reduce the number of false positive annotations. In detail, the first criterion, hereafter referred to as ""R"", is based on the ratio of the observed extent of genome coverage with the expected extent of genome coverage, computed asC o is the observed extent of genome coverage by the mapped reads, computed aswhere L s is the actual length of the genome that is supported or covered by the mapped reads and L g is the length of the genome. C e is the expected extent of genome coverage, assuming a Poisson distribution for the mapped reads along the genome, and therefore,where N is the number of mapped reads to the genome, L r is the read length, and L g is the length of the genome. If a virus has R < 0.3, FastViromeExplorer discards the virus. This criterion is motivated by the observation that some annotated viruses only have reads mapped to the repeat regions of their genomes. For example, while analyzing the fecal samples from Lee et al. [14] , we found that for the BeAn 58058 virus (NC 032111.1), all the reads were mapped to one particular region of its genome, from 8,200 bp to 8,700 bp (see supplementary figure 1 ). Analyzing this region using RepeatMasker [27] revealed that it is a simple repeat region and falls into the class of Alu elements. If the virus is truly present in the sample, we expect reads to be mapped to not only the repeat region but also other regions of the genome. Therefore, finding this virus is likely an artifact caused by the prevalence of repeat regions instead of real biological signals. By imposing this criterion, we filter out any virus for which all the reads are mapped to a repeat region of the virus genome. If a virus is truly present in the sample, the mapped reads to the virus should come from random locations of the genome, assuming that the mapped reads follow a Poisson distribution along the genome, the expected coverage of the virus genome C e can be computed by Equation (3). If the reads are all mapped to a repeat region, the observed coverage of the virus genome C o is expected to be much lower than C e , as a result, R is low and by imposing a cutoff of 0.3 (determined based on our empirical analyses), viruses that have reads mapped to only repeat regions get filtered out.The second criterion requires C o ≥ 0.1, that is, a virus that has C o < 0.1 is discarded. This criterion requires that the mapped reads should cover at least 10% of the viral genome. Manual inspection of the annotation results reveals that very large viruses may have several repeat regions in their genomes and as a result, though all the reads are mapped to the repeat regions, they are mapped to different repeat regions. In these cases, the difference between C o and C e may be small and therefore R can be high enough to pass the first filter. However, it is very likely that the annotation is simply an artifact of repetitive sequences. For example, while analyzing the fecal samples [14] , we found that Pandoravirus dulcis (NC 021858.1), a very large virus with 1,908,524 bps, has several repeat regions, and all the reads were mapped only to the repeat regions (see supplementary figure 2 ). Hence, to alleviate this annotation artifact, C o ≥ 0.1 is used as the second filter. As repeat regions of a virus usually cover less than 10% of the genome [19] , if any virus is covered for more than 10% by the reads, it is reasonable to assume that the reads are not merely from repeat regions and thus the virus should be considered in the annotation result.The third criterion is based on the number of mapped reads N . Extensive empirical analysis and inspection of the annotation results show that for very small viruses, only a few reads are enough to cover a good portion of the viral genome, resulting in high R and C o that pass criteria 1 and 2. For example, in the fecal samples [14] that we annotated, four reads were mapped to Rose rosette virus RNA3 (NC 015300.1). As the virus has only 1,544 bps, four reads of length 150 bps were enough to pass criteria 1 and 2. But as only a handful of reads are mapped, it is likely that the virus is false positive. To be more stringent, FastViromeExplorer applies the third filter requiring the number of mapped reads to be greater than 10, and therefore discards the ones with N < 10.After applying all the filters, FastViromeExplorer outputs the final result that contains a list of identified viruses in the given sample along with the estimated read count or abundance and taxonomy of the viruses. The output list is sorted by the abundance with the most abundant viruses on the top of the list.It is worth noting that the three criteria are introduced to alleviate annotation artifacts caused by factors such as repeat sequences and low genome coverage, the actual cutoff values for R, C o , and N are based on our empirical experience and literature observation, and depending on the specific studies and the need of users, the cutoff values used here might not be suitable. To allow for flexibility and customization, FastViromeExplorer incorporates these three filters as parameters so that users can easily adjust the values to adapt to their own studies. For example, users can deploy more stringent criteria by setting higher values for R, C o , and N than the default, to get a ""high confidence"" set of viruses.FastViromeExplorer was run on both simulated and real data to examine its running time and accuracy. FastViromeExplorer used kallisto (version 0.43.1) with default settings and generated pseudoalignment results in sam format and filtered abundance results in a tab-delimited file. The abundance results contain identified virus names, NCBI accession numbers, NCBI taxonomic path, and estimated read counts. FastViromeExplorer was run on two different reference databases, the default database distributed together with FastViromeExplorer, that is, the NCBI RefSeq database containing 8,957 genomes of eukaryotic viruses and phages, and the set of sequences collected from the JGI ""earth virome"" study [18] containing 125,842 metagenomic viral contigs (mVCs). The taxonomic annotation and host information for these mVCs were collected from the IMG/VR database [17] .In addition to the challenge of mapping 10s or 100s of millions of metagenomic reads, tools for the accurate identification and quantification of viral genomes must also be capable of handling ever-growing reference databases of viral sequences. In order to measure how the indexing step of kallisto scales with reference databases of different sizes, kallisto was applied to index five different databases. Three databases were generated from NCBI RefSeq viral database, one containing only phages (2,187 phage genomes), one containing only eukaryotic viruses (6,770 eukaryotic virus genomes), and one containing both phages and eukaryotic viruses (8,957 viral genomes). The other two databases were created from sequences collected from Paez-Espino et al. [18] , one containing all the 125,842 mVCs and the other containing half of the mVCs. The time analysis of kallisto's indexing step was produced on a Linux based cluster with 64 CPUs and 128 GB RAM. The indexing step was run using default k-mer size 31 and default number of threads 1. The precomputed kallisto index file for the full 125,842 mVCs from JGI is available here: https://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/zhanglab/software/FastViromeExplorer/.To evaluate the performance of FastViromeExplorer, we compared speed and accuracy with ViromeScan, a recently developed virus annotation pipeline that calls BOWTIE2 as a subprocess for read mapping, that was shown to be 1,000 times faster than previous tools [20] . ViromeScan was run with default settings and with the eukaryotic DNA/RNA virus database containing 4,370 genome sequences, the largest reference database provided by ViromeScan, and with a custom database consisting of the 125,842 mVCs from JGI. ViromeScan generated alignment results and abundances of viruses at family, genus, and species level. We also ran Blastn (version ncbi-blast-2.6.0+) using both the NCBI RefSeq viral database and the large JGI database. Blastn only generated the alignment result in text format. All the time analyses were calculated using elapsed real time from Unix's time command.To examine the annotation accuracy of FastViromeExplorer, simulated metagenomic data were used. A randomly selected collection of genomes containing 4000 virus genomes and 2000 bacteria genomes were obtained from NCBI RefSeq database. Four paired-end read datasets, each containing one million reads of length 100bps, were generated from these genomes using the read simulator WGSIM (https://github.com/lh3/wgsim). For all the datasets, 49% reads were from viruses and 51% from bacteria. The four datasets were generated using 1% sequencing error rate and 3%, 5%, 7%, or 10% mutation rates respectively. ViromeScan and Blastn were also applied to these four datasets. As ViromeScan uses eukaryotic viruses as the reference database, for comparison, both FastViromeExplorer and Blastn were run on a reference database containing only NCBI RefSeq eukaryotic viruses. ViromeScan was run with the eukaryotic virus database provided by ViromeScan. Under the default setting, ViromeScan removed all the mapped reads during its quality filtering and trimming step (trimBWAstyle.pl script) and did not produce any results. Therefore, it was run without ViromeScan's quality filtering and trimming step. With the ground truth for the alignment of the reads, recall, precision, and F1 score were calculated using the following formula:To examine the running time and annotation performance of FastViromeExplorer on real data, the fecal metagenomics datasets described in Lee et al. [14] were downloaded from NCBI under the accession number SRP093449 and annotated with both FastViromeExplorer and ViromeScan. The study tracked bacteria colonization in a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment through analyzing metagenomics data. To examine how the viruses/bacteriaphages were affected by the transplantation, we reanalyzed the four fecal metagenomic samples collected from a healthy donor and three samples from a recipient patient suffering mild/moderate ulcerative colitis. The three samples for the recipient were collected prior to FMT, four weeks after FMT, and eight weeks after FMT, respectively. All the reads were Illumina paired-end reads with 150bp read length. Seven data sets of different sizes (1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 million reads) were also generated from the samples and annotated by FastViromeExplorer and ViromeScan to compare their running time on large datasets. To examine the effect of the reference database on annotation results, FastViromeExplorer was applied to the samples using two different reference databases, FastViromeExplorer's default reference database and the set of 125,842 mVCs collected from the study [18] . While using the NCBI RefSeq database as reference, a Linux based laptop with Intel core i5-3230M CPU @ 2.60 GHz * 4 processors and 12 GB RAM was used to produce the results, and while using the 125,842 mVCs as reference, a Linux based cluster with 64 CPUs and 128 GB RAM was used to produce the results. While using the cluster, only 1 thread was used to run the tools. 

Results and Discussion

We applied kallisto to index five databases of different sizes and calculated the running time of the indexing step. Figure 1 shows that indexing time increases linearly with the size of the reference databases, 5 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/196998 doi: bioRxiv preprint and for the largest reference database of 2 GB, kallisto took 3 hours and 38 minutes to generate the index file.To examine how running time changes with sample size, we created seven data sets with 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 million reads respectively from the data described in Lee et al. [14] and applied FastViromeExplorer, ViromeScan, and Blastn. As Blastn took too long to run on large data sets, we run Blastn on only three data sets of size 1, 3, and 5 million reads respectively. Two databases, one containing all NCBI RefSeq viral genomes and the other containing 125,842 mVCs from Paez-Espino et al. [18] , were used as the reference databases, to also examine the effect of reference databases on running time. Figure 2a shows the running time using the NCBI database as reference. FastViromeExplorer has the shortest running time for all the seven data sets. For the data set with 5 million reads FastViromeExplorer took only seven minutes, compared to 12 minutes for ViromeScan, 31 minutes for Blastn. The speedup of FastViromeExplorer compared to ViromeScan became much more pronouced when a larger reference database was used. Figure 2b shows that when we used the larger reference database, for a data set with 5 million reads, FastViromeExplorer took 17 minutes, compared to 53 minutes for ViromeScan, and 4 hours and 40 minutes for Blastn. So FastViromeExplorer ran 3 times faster than ViromeScan and 16 times faster than Blastn. For the largest data set with 40 million reads, FastViromeExplorer took 2 hours and 27 minutes, a 2.5x speedup compared to ViromeScan that took 6 hours and 23 minutes. Taken together, when using NCBI virus and phage database as reference, FastViromeExplorer takes on average about 1 minute to process one million reads; when using a larger database (125,842 mVCs, 2GB), FastViromeExplorer takes 3-4 minutes to process one million reads, a 2-3x speed up compared to ViromeScan. Note that the indexing time (for both FastViromeExplorer and ViromeScan) was not counted in the running time shown (Figure 2 ) as indexing is only one time process. Once the index file is generated, it can be used to annotate any metagenomic data. Simulated datasets were initially used to compare the annotation performance of FastViromeExploree with Viromescan and Blastn. Sinces viruses mutate fast, even if it is the same viral species, the viral sequences in the metagenomic data might not be exactly the same as their sequences in the reference database, it is therefore important to examine the performance of an annotation tool taking into account 6 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/196998 doi: bioRxiv preprint Figure 2 : Comparison of running time among FastViromeExplorer, ViromeScan, and Blastn for seven data sets with 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 million reads, respectively (a) against a reference database containing 8,957 NCBI RefSeq viruses, (b) against a reference database containing 125,842 mVCs virus' high mutation rate. We therefore simulated four data sets with different mutation rates (3%, 5%, 7%, and 10%) from the references and applied FastViromeExplorer, ViromeScan, and Blastn. Figure 3 shows the F1 score (recall and precision are given in supplementary file 1). All the tools have high precision (99%) across all the data sets. But as mutation rate becomes higher, the number of mapped reads reduces and recall becomes lower for all the tools. In terms of F1 score, Blastn has the best score, FastViromeExplorer has similar but slightly lower score, and ViromeScan has the lowest score. For the data set with the highest mutation rate 10%, the F1 scores for Blastn, FastViromeExplorer and ViromeScan are 0.79, 0.7, and 0.43 respectively. But FastViromeExplorer took 2 minutes compared to Blastn 8 minutes. Therefore, for these simulated data sets and using all eukarytoic viruses as the reference database, FastViromeExplorer runs four times faster than Blastn while maintaining a similar F1 score to Blastn. As viruses are known to have fast mutation rates, Blastn and its variants (e.g., Blastp) are considered the ""gold standard"" approach to annotate viral sequences in metagenomic data but very time-consuming, having similar performance yet running much faster is highly desired for an annotation tool.To examine the annotation performance of FastViromeExplorer on real data, we applied FastViromeExplorer to the fecal metagenomic samples collected from Lee et al. [14] . Lee et al. followed the dynamics and consequence of fecal micriobial transplantation (FMT) by examining the metagenomics data from a donor's and recipients' preFMT and postFMT samples. They constructed 92 bacterial metagenomeassembled genomes (MAGs) from reads of the donor samples and examined the occurrence of the MAGs in the recipient samples. They found that the bacterial MAGs that were present in the donor samples and also colonized the recipient samples after FMT mostly belonged to the order Bacteroidales. Here we examined the dynamics of viruses/phages to see whether it is consistent with the finding of Lee et al. [14] .From the annotation result of FastViromeExplorer using the 8,957 NCBI RefSeq viral genomes as reference, we observed that only three viruses (Human endogenous retrovirus K113, Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus segment C10, and Lactococcus prophage bIL311) were found in all four donor samples, with human endogenous retrovirus K113 being the most abundant for samples 1, 3, and 4, and Lactococcus prophage bIL311 the most abundant in sample 2. For the recipient, 30 viruses were found in the preFMT sample whereas only five were found in the two postFMT samples. Among the five viruses, only Lactococcus prophage was also found in one donor sample. But as this prophage was also present in the preFMT sample, we cannot conclude that the virus was transferred from the donor to the recipient. Overall, the annotation result reveals no clear evidence of virus/phage transfer from the donor to the recipient. Figure 3 : F1 score of FastViromeExplorer, ViromeScan, and Blastn when using NCBI eukaryotic viruses as the reference database and four simulated data sets of 1 million reads each with mutation rate 3%, 5%, 7%, and 10% respectively.We also applied ViromeScan to the fecal samples with its default reference database containing 4,370 eukaryotic DNA/RNA viruses. ViromeScan identified 847 viruses in all the samples. Compared to ViromeScan's reference database, ours is two times bigger and it is thus surprising that ViromeScan identified a lot more viruses than FastViromeExplorer. Analysis of the ViromeScan result shows that the most abundant virus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, has all the reads mapped to a repeat region of its genome (see supplementary figure 3 ), indicating that the annotation is likely false positive. In fact, Encephalomyocarditis virus was also present in the initial result produced by FastViromeExplorer, but was discarded after the first filtering step. To further examine the effect of our three filtering criteria, we applied them to the ViromeScan result. Figure 4 shows that most of the viruses were filtered out and only Human endogenous retrovirus K113 and Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus remained, both of which were also present in the final result of FastViromeExplorer. The finding here shows the importance of the filtering criteria in removing viruses that might be annotation artifacts caused by repeats, low coverage, and small genome sizes.Since the annotation of the fecal samples using the default NCBI viral database did not reveal anything meaningful about fecal microbiota transplantation from the donor to the recipient, we tried FastViromeExplorer again using the 125,842 metagenomic viral contigs (mVCs) collected from Paez et al. [18] as reference. These mVCs are mostly unknown partial or complete viral genomes but have been predicted/annotated for their possible hosts. Therefore, the host information of the mVCs can be used to examine the annotation result. Figure 5 shows the relative abundance of host bacteria across all donor and recipient samples. The order Bacteroidales is more abundant than the order Clostridiales in all donor samples. For the recipient, prior to FMT, the order Clostridiales clearly dominated the microbiota, however, after the transplantation, the abundance of the order Bacteroidales increased dramatically and the abundance of the order Clostridiales decreased greatly. This result indicates that due to the transplantation, phages with host bacteria from the order Bacteroidales were transferred from the donor to the recipient. For example, in donor samples, ""SRS049900 LANL scaffold 14438"" is one of the most abundant mVC, being the most abundant in donor samples 1 and 2, and the second most abundant in samples 3 and 4. This mVC was not present in the recipient's preFMT sample but was highly abundant in the postFMT samples, suggesting the successful transferring of the mVC from the donor to the recipient.As the host of this mVC is from the order Bacteroidales, this suggests the successful colonization of bacteria from the order Bacteroidales from the donoor to the recipient. Therefore, our result on phage transfer following the FMT is consistent with the observation on bacterial colonization following the FMT shown in the original study [14] . The detailed annotation result is given in supplementary file 2. Figure 4 : Number of viruses from ViromeScan result before applying any filter, after applying criterion 1, after applying criteria 1 and 2, and after applying all three criteria. Consequently, when we applied FastViromeExplorer to the samples using a larger reference database, a much clear correlation between our results and the biological results reported in the original paper emerges, 9 .

Conclusion

In this paper, we develop a new tool FastViromeExplorer for annotating virus types and abundances in metagenomic data. Worth emphasizing is that FastViromeExplorer can annotate both viruses and phages depending on the reference database users deploy. As FastViromeExplorer can process millions of reads within minutes while having similar annotation accuracy to the gold standard tool Blastn, it empowers researchers that have limitted computing power to process large metagenomic data within reasonable time. Similar to all other reference database based tools, the limitation of FastViromeExplorer is that it cannot identify a virus or phage if it is not in the reference database. Together with the result of FMT data, it highlights the pressing issue of building and/or extending the current viral sequence database for improving virus/phage annotation in metagenomic data..

"Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 690,000 confirmed cases and more than 33,000 confirmed deaths globally as of March 30, 2020 [1-4]. At present two central public health control strategies have emerged: mitigation and suppression (e.g, [5] ). Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by reducing interactions (and both raise questions of sustainability and long-term tactics). Complementary to those approaches, here we develop and analyze an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests [6, 7] to identify and deploy recovered individuals as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, i.e., to develop what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. Recovered individuals, in the present context, represent those who have developed protective, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are no longer shedding virus [8] . The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services (including but not limited to tending to the elderly [9], hospital care, schools, and food supply) while decreasing the probability of transmission during such essential interactions. We show that a shield immunity approach may significantly reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of an outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well recognized roles in estimating prevalence [10, 11] and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies [12] [13] [14] [15] .

","

In the absence of reliable pharmaceutical interventions against SARS-CoV-2, multiple public health strategies are being deployed to slow the coronavirus pandemic [1, 5, 16] . These strategies can be broadly grouped into two approaches: mitigation; and suppression. Mitigation includes a combination of social distancing (including school and university closures), case testing, and symptomatic case isolation to reduce epidemic spread and burden on hospitals. Mitigation is intended to lessen an outbreak, however the level of disease may still overwhelm health services [5] . Instead, some jurisdictions have either pre-emptively or reactively adopted a combination of travel restrictions (shown to be effective in curtailing dispersion if implemented early enough [17, 18] ) and suppression: imposing complete shut-downs of the bulk of non-essential services for extended periods (e.g., sheltering in place). Suppression has led to marked decreases in prevalence in the short term by combining case isolation, quarantine, use of separate facilities for treating COVID- 19 patients, and large-scale viral testing to reduce transmission. Suppression also comes with significant costs, threatening social order and socio-economic health.Here, we propose a complementary intervention approach that is intended to reduce transmission while lessening the costs of suppression and mitigation. The core idea is to leverage a mechanism of 'interaction substitution' by identifying and deploying recovered individuals who have protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The intent is to develop population-level 'shield immunity' by amplifying the proportion of interactions with recovered individuals relative to those of individuals of unknown status (see Figure 1 ). Here, we assume that recovered individuals (i.e., virus-negative and antibodypositive) can safely interact with both susceptible and infectious individuals, in effect substituting interactions between susceptible and infectious individuals for interactions with a recovered individual. The intervention strategy is both local in scope and scales with outbreak size, given that the potential impact of shield immunity grows with a local outbreak. We recognize that our assumptions about safety for both recovered individuals and those they interact with is of vital importance.

Bonds denote interactions between individuals. In the Shield Immunity panel, the icon in the recovered individuals denotes the identification of individuals with protective antibodies, and hence the enhanced contribution of such individuals to shield immunity in contrast to the Baseline panel.shield immunity.To illustrate the concept of shield immunity, consider an epidemic model in which individuals tend to substitute their interactions with identified (or strategically located) recovered individuals. Hence, rather than mixing at random, we consider a relative preference of 1 + α that a given individual will interact with a recovered individual in what would otherwise be a potentially infectious interaction. The dynamics of the fraction of susceptible S, infectious I, and recovered R individuals are:(1)such that when α = 0 we recover the conventional SIR model. Note that the denominator of 1 + αR can be thought of as S + I + R + αR. Given that S + I + R = 1, this is equivalent to the term 1 + αR. Detailed mixing and substitution models could lead to variations of this model, e.g., in spatially explicit domains, on networks, etc [19] [20] [21] [22] . Figure 2 illustrates shield immunity impacts on an SIR epidemic with R 0 = 2.5. In this SIR model, shield immunity reduces the epidemic peak and reduces epidemic duration. In effect, shielding acts as a negative feedback loop, i.e., given that the effective reproduction number is R ef f (t)/R 0 = S(t)/(1 + αR(t)). As a result, interaction substitution increases as recovered individuals increase in number and are identified. For example, in the case of α = 20, the epidemic concludes with less than 20% infected in contrast to the final size of approximately 90% in the baseline scenario without shielding.We next apply the concept of shield immunity to the epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, ignoring births and other causes of deaths for simplicity. Consider a population of susceptible S, exposed E, infectious asymptomatically I a , infectious symptomatically I s , and recovered R who are free to move, without restrictions in a 'business as usual' scenario. A subset of symptomatic cases will require hospital care, which we further divide into subacute I hsub , and critical/acute (i.e., requiring ICU intervention) I hcri cases. We assume that a sub-. CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. stantial fraction of critical cases will die. Age-stratified risk of hospitalization and acute cases are adapted from the Imperial College of London report [5] . The full model incorporating shield immunity (see SI for equations and details, and Figure S1 for a schematic) differs from conventional SIR models with social distancing or case isolation interventions in a key way: the rate of transmission is reduced by a factor of 1/ (N tot + αR shields ) where N tot denotes the fraction of the population in the 'circulating baseline', and R shields denotes the total number of recovered individuals between the ages of 20-60 (a subset of the total recovered population). In this model, we assume that all recovered individuals have immunity, but that only a subset are available to facilitate interaction substitutions. The model assumes that the circulating pool is not interacting with hospitalized patients, which must be incorporated into implementation scenarios with healthcare workers (HCW-s), who represent an intended target for shield immunity [23] ). The baseline epidemiological parameters, age stratified risk, and population structure are listed in the SI (adapted from [5, [24] [25] [26] [27] ; see github for code and full implementation details).We use the baseline epidemiological parameters and seed an outbreak with a single exposed individual until the outbreak reaches 0.1% total prevalence, e.g., 10,000 individuals infected out of a population of 10,000,000, at which point a shielding strategy is implemented. Outbreak scenarios differ in transmission rates, with R 0 = 1.57 and 2.33 in the low and high scenarios, respectively. Early estimates of R 0 from Wuhan are consistent with a 95% CI of between 2.1 and 4.5 [28] , putting our high scenario on the conservative end of estimated ranges. However, the R 0 of the high scenario we examine here is consistent with the range of 2.0 to 2.6 considered by the Imperial College London group [5] , and with the median of R ef f = 2.38 (95% CI: 2.04-2.77) as estimated via stochastic model fits to outbreak data in China that accounts for undocumented transmission [26] . Moreover, control measures reduce transmission, and our low scenario is consistent with estimates of R ef f = 1.36 (95% CI: 1.14-1.63) in China from Jan. 24 to Feb. 3 after travel restrictions and other control measures were imposed. Figure 3 shows the results of comparing interventions to the baseline case. As in the simple SIR model, shielding (on its own) could potentially decrease epidemic burden across multiple metrics, decreasing both the total impact and shortening the peak event. In a population of size 10,000,000 for the high scenario, the final epidemic predictions are 71,000 deaths in the baseline case vs. 58,000 deaths given intermediate shielding (α = 2), and 20,000 deaths given enhanced shielding (α = 20). In a population of size 10,000,000 for the low scenario, the final epi-. CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. demic predictions are 50,000 deaths in the baseline case vs. 34,000 deaths given intermediate shielding, and 8,300 deaths given enhanced shielding. The majority of deaths are in those ages 60 and above, despite the lower fraction of individuals in those ranges (see Figure 3 ), consistent with estimates in related COVID-19 models [5, 25, 26] and from outbreaks in Italy and China [29] . Note that our simulation results consider impacts based on shielding alone; whereas ongoing restrictions via social distancing and shelter in place orders will reduce interaction rates (a point we revisit later). The effectiveness of shielding depends on the product of the number of potential shields identified and their effective substitutability, i.e, αR, combining identification of and interaction rate by shields. The population-scale impacts of shielding depends on multiple factors, including demographic distributions, the fraction of asymptomatic transmission ( [24, 26] ), and the duration of immunity. The SI treats each of these items at length. First, we find that populations with a strongly right-shifted demographic distribution will receive more potential benefits from shielding. Even though there are fewer recovered individuals between the ages of 20-60 to draw from (in a relative sense), the impact of shield immunity is greater. We find that the relative reduction in deaths via shield immunity is proportional to the relative differences in the fraction of population over 60 (e.g., see SI for details on US-state level analysis, similar results hold for countries like Italy where more than 23% of the population is older than 65 and nearly 30% is older than 60; Figures S2-S3) . Second, shield immunity is robust to variation in asymptomatic infection probabilities, improving outcomes in models with varying baseline levels of asymptomatic transmission (see Figures S4-S6 ). In addition, the present model results assumes that immunity has relatively fast onset and is permanent in duration. Clinical work in Zhejiang University, China, suggests that seroconversion of total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibodies developed with a median period of 15, 18, and 20 days, respectively (albeit for symptomatic patients in a hospital; similar data for seroconversion of asymptomatic individuals was not included [30] ). In the SI we show that impacts of shield immunity is robust insofar as the duration of immunity is 4 months or longer ( Figures S7-S8) ; we note that distinct control measures that extend the epidemic would likely impact effectiveness of shield immunity. For context, the titer of protective antibodies in individuals infected with related betacoronaviruses (causing mild/moderate symptoms) reduced over a one year period such that re-exposure can lead to re-infection [31] , in contrast to evidence of multi-year immunity for individuals recovered from SARS [32] . In addition, we emphasize that the accuracy of serological tests is key. The benefits of shield immunity can be undermined if recovered individuals can be reinfected (even with little danger to them), or potentially misidentified, leading to interaction substitution with individuals that could infect others (a risk reduced by combining serology with PCR).Thus far we have focused on the impacts of shield immunity as a singular strategy, yet in practice, multiple interventions will be used in parallel. Hence, we evaluated the synergistic potential of utilizing shield immunity in combination with social distancing. Social distancing is modeled as a reduction in the transmission rates sustained over the post-intervention period. As is apparent in Figure 4 , shielding can augment social distancing, particularly when social distancing is relatively ineffective. For example, contour lines of reduction in total fatalities suggest that a combination of 10% reduction in trans-.

However, there is a trade-off. Because social distancing reduces contacts and transmission, there are fewer recovered individuals when β is reduced by 50%. Nonetheless benefits of shielding accrue at all levels of social distancing. Social distancing and shield immunity may work in combination to improve outcomes in terms of expected hospitalization burden, again suggesting a role for shield immunity in reducing transmission and reducing the negative impacts of suppression-level social distancing policies. Finally, we note that targeted shield immunity may also enhance population outcomes by focusing the effort of recovered individuals in subsets of the population. In the SI, we show heuristic solutions to an optimization formulation of targeted (i.e., age-specific) shield immunity in this model. In effect, by preferentially targeting older individuals, it is possible to further reduce cumulative deaths by ≈ 30% (see Figures S9-S11) .Serology testing is needed now, at scale, for many reasons. Here, we have shown a rationale for serology testing as a means to facilitate interventions beyond those of mitigation and suppression. Identifying and deploying recovered individuals could represent more than just a metric of the state of the COVID-19 epidemic, e.g., to better measure prevalence and the 'denominator', but an opportunity to slow transmission by developing population-level shield immunity. Many logistical, social, and dynamical challenges remain if such an idea were to move from theory to feasibility. Accurate and rapid serological tests are needed at scale, including targeted surveys to identify essential workers and via populationlevel surveys. The potential scale of shield immunity depends on both the intrinsic epidemic dynamics, driving the number of recovered individuals able to provide shield immunity, and also on the ability to identify and deploy them (e.g., via the shielding parameter α). Yet, even if such tests were available, who should get them? Public health authorities and governmental agencies should consider how to prioritize those in critical roles, those with experience in disaster response, as well as prior individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 (and could then return for both serology-based and viral shedding assays). Positive confirmation of immunity and cessation of viral shedding could help identify and deploy (tens of) thousands of individuals as part of a shield immunity strategy, with the greatest concentration likely co-located with areas in greatest need of intervention. A national (or global) strategy could consider the deployment of critical response workers to help control new outbreaks.We recognize there are significant challenges to developing and implementing interventions that aim to develop population-wide shield immunity. Nonetheless, the magnitude of the current public health and economic crisis demands large-scale action (e.g., [33, 34] ). The efficacy of a shield immunity strategy will be demographic-, test-and context-dependent. Beyond the near-term, the duration of immune memory is also relevant in projecting to a multi-year post-pandemic framework where demographic dynamics and strain evolution are increasingly relevant [35, 36] . In moving forward, it will be critical to understand how shield immunity is modulated by spatial and network structure. In a network, wellconnected individuals have a disproportionate effect on the spread of disease [20] . Network structure represents an opportunity to position immune shields at focal points of 'essential' services, and even to prioritize the focus of population-scale serological prevalence assays based on the connectivity of targeted individuals. Although the number of laboratory confirmations is both staggering and growing, the actual number of infections is higher -likely far higher; for example in China, 80% of transmission of new cases were from undocumented infections [26] and there is significant uncertainty with respect to case ascertainment [37] . Asymptomatic transmission may paradoxically provide a greater pool of recovered individuals to develop shield immunity at scale. We contend that it is time for collective action to ascertain more information on prevalence and to consider strategic use of serology as the basis for public health intervention to slow the pandemic spread of COVID-19.Data availability: All simulation and codes used in the development of this manuscript are available at https: //github.com/WeitzGroup/covid_shield_immunity.

"Abstract

The novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) outbreak has been a serious concern around the globe. Since people are in tremor due to the massive spread of Coronavirus in the major parts of the world, it requires to predict the risk of this infectious disease. In this situation, we develop a model to measure the risk of infectious disease and predict the risk of 2019-nCOV transmission by using data of four countries-US, Australia, Canada and China.The model underlies that higher the population density, higher the risk of transmission of infectious disease from human to human. Besides, population size, case identification rate and travel of infected passengers in different regions are also incorporated in this model.

","Introduction

Novel Coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) related to Coronavirus that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic 10 years ago, was first detected in Saudi Arabia and it has been spreading in other countries since 2012[1]. In December 2019, China noticed few pneumonia cases relating to novel Coronavirus (2019-nCOV). Told case incidence has been increasing dramatically and reached the hundreds, but it is likely to be an under-estimate [2] . The Coronavirus menace has now been spread all over the countries in globe. As of March 24, 2020, there were 372757 confirmed Novel Coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) cases in 196 countries of which 16224 death cases were traced out worldwide [3] . This endemic of novel Coronavirus has been caused due to the mobility and interaction of people who moved from one country to another by outbound fights. Therefore, we argue that densely populated countries as well as cities are more likely to be infected with novel Coronavirus because of inbound and outbound flights and other means of transports. It implies that both in-bound and out-bound flights of passengers are significant factors in triggering Coronavirus infection risk in more densely populated countries than in less densely populated countries. However, previous studies did not consider the population density factor while modeling the risk of 2019-nCOV transmission. Recent studies estimates the risk of Coronavirus transmission from the Chinese cities to other destinations [4, 5] . More importantly, Haider et al. (2020) built a risk index using the number of air travelers multiplied by the weight of the number of infected cases. Apart from previous studies, our study can fill the research gap constructing a risk index that takes population density and size, case identification rate, and the number of air travel into account.

Risk Index

We present a mathematical model that assesses the risk of infectious diseases such as Coronavirus. The model includes population size and density, the number of identified cases, case identification rate, and passengers' travel among different regions. Risk Index (RI) of a certain infectious disease in a specific area ij a of a country i C where n i ,..., 3 , 2 , 1 = andis estimated for a given Calculation Period (CP) which is usually days, weeks, months or even years. RI is unit free which makes it comparable among areas; higher the RI, the greater the risk. Therefore, RI of an area ij a is defined aswhere, ij A and ij T are the area and the travel specific risk components respectively.

Area specific risk

Area specific component estimates the risk of infectious diseases posed by the factors such as the number of identified cases, population size, and case identification rate. We also consider mobility-interaction factor to estimate the risk of spreading infectious diseases as mobility and interaction among people contribute to spread infectious diseases according to some studies [6] [7] [8] . So, it is expected that the higher the mobility and interaction among people in an area, the higher the risk of spreading infectious diseases. We can call it ""Mobility-Interaction Effect"". The reasoning behind such hypothesis is that people have the tendency to amass in an area which provides better environment, livelihood, education, and other amenities. The aggregation process continues further with the economic development, forcing people to move low density areas to high density areas. As a result, people living in high density areas have higher mobility and interaction among themselves than the people living in low density areas [9] . Therefore, we propose that Relative Mobility-Interaction Effect (RMIE) can be estimated by the relative population density of that area within a country.For an area ij a , having the population density ij D in country i C , RMIE is measured as .

An important feature of the measure (3) is that if an area has no identified case, we can assess area specific risk by country specific risk since through mobility-interaction effect of other areas create pressure of spreading disease to that particular area.

Travel specific risk

Drawing experience from previous outbreak of infectious diseases including the recent epidemic of Coronavirus, literatures suggest addressing the risk of travelling among different areas and countries [10] [11] [12] . In our study, the travel specific risk component for area ij a of jwhere pq V is the number of travelers who left the area pq a for different destinations within the time duration ߂ ‫ݐ‬ , ij pq V , is the number of travelers who arrive at the area ij a from pq a within . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. .Some interesting features of this index are worthwhile to mention. The index says that there is a risk of Coronavirus spreading even though the travel specific risk component becomes zero. That means even if a country imposes air travel restriction internationally, the risk of transmission still exists. The area specific component of the index actually portrays the dynamics of infectious disease spreading influenced by mobility and interaction among people. One of the important implications of the area specific component is that restricting international movement is not sufficient to contain the risk of Coronavirus spreading in particular and infectious diseases in general. Internal restriction is also important to suppress transmission risk in an area which is exactly what the current situation says. In that sense, we expect that our index has the higher probability of mimicking the current situation of Coronavirus.

Data sources

Data on Coronavirus identified cases, population size and density, and air travel among areas of the four countries -US, Canada, Australia and China are collected from three different sources. First, the total number of confirmed cases (up to 26 March 2020) and the dates of first identification of Coronavirus cases in geographic areas (territory/province/state) are extracted from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) (https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/) [13, 14] . Second, data on population size and geometric area are collected from the website https://www.citypopulation.de. Finally, because of insufficient passengers' travel data, we incorporate air travel data only among these areas. Air travel data are obtained from FLIRT (https://flirt.eha.io), a flight network analysis tool developed by EcoHealth Alliance which provides simulated passengers' data for the final destination from different airports based on flight schedule database of 800 airlines [12, 15] .

Data analysis

We have defined the calculation period (CP) from 31 st December 2019 to 27 th March 2020.The total number of confirmed Coronavirus cases are accumulated up to 26 th March 2020 for different areas of respective countries. Population density (population per square kilometer) of these areas is calculated by dividing population size by the respective geometric area. At first, we calculate area specific component using equation 3. To estimate travel specific risk component presented in equation 4, we calculate the proportion of travelers arrived at area ij a from other areas directly by using simulated data from FLIRT.

Results

In this study, we present Coronavirus risk ranking of 104 areas (territory/province/state) of four countries based on our developed risk index (RI). Table 1 

Discussion

China (Hubei Province) as a breeding ground was the highest in the importation to Coronavirus infection across the globe. Later, this pandemic rapidity of this disease has now captured US and some other parts of the world. It has been spread at a geometric rate due to the mobility and interaction of people through air-borne movement from one country to another or from one city to another. In this respect, our study models a risk index to measure the human to human Coronavirus transmission mainly caused by people's mobility and interaction. Therefore, we recommend avoiding any mass gathering, maintaining recommended physical distance and restricting inbound and outbound flights across different areas/cities and countries as well..

"Abstract

Currently, COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been widely spread around the world; nevertheless, so far there exist no specific antiviral drugs for treatment of the disease, which poses great challenge to control and contain the virus. Here, we reported a research finding that SARS-CoV-2 invaded host cells via a novel route of CD147-spike protein (SP). SP bound to CD147, a receptor on the host cells, thereby mediating the viral invasion.Our further research confirmed this finding. First, in vitro antiviral tests indicated Meplazumab, an anti-CD147 humanized antibody, significantly inhibited the viruses from invading host cells, with an EC 50 of 24.86 μg/mL and IC 50 of 15.16 μg/mL. Second, we validated the interaction between CD147 and SP, with an affinity constant of 1.85×10 -7 M. Co-Immunoprecipitation and ELISA also confirmed the binding of the two proteins. Finally, the localization of CD147 and SP was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells by immuno-electron microscope. Therefore, the discovery of the new route CD147-SP for SARS-CoV-2 invading host cells provides a critical target for development of specific antiviral drugs.

the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, intensive researches are urgently needed to elucidate the invasive mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, thereby providing a potential target for developing specific antiviral drugs.It has been reported that CoVs are non-segmented positive sense RNA viruses, which primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals and have demonstrated strong lethality in humans [1, 2] . These viruses are known to have four structural proteins, including E, M, N and S protein [3, 4] . The primary determinant of CoVs tropism is the S protein, which binds to the membrane receptor on the host cells, mediating the viral and cellular membrane fusion [5] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homologue of ACE, is one of the important receptors on the cell membrane of the host cells.The interaction of SP and ACE2 contributes to the SARS-CoV invasion for host cells [6] . Interestingly, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 SP is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV SP, and SARS-CoV-2 SP binds to ACE2 with a higher affinity than SARS-CoV SP, indicative of a stronger ability of SAR-CoV-2 to invade host cells [7, 8] . In addition to ACE2, other receptors for SP binding on the host cell membrane remain unclear.CD147, also known as Basigin or EMMPRIN, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily [9] , which is involved in tumor development, plasmodium invasion and virus infection [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Our previous researches show that CD147 plays a functional role in facilitating SARS-CoV invasion for host cells, and CD147-antagonistic peptide-9 has a high binding rate to HEK293 cells and an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV [16] . These researches affirm the importance of CD147 in virus invasion for host cells. Owing to the similar characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we conduct the present study to investigate the possible function of CD147 in invasion for host cells by SARS-CoV-2.In our study, we reported SARS-CoV-2 invaded host cells via a novel route of CD147-SP.Meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, could competitively inhibit the binding of SP and CD147 and prevent the viruses from invading host cells, which provides a potential target for developing antiviral drugs.

Blocking CD147 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication

The antiviral tests were performed to investigate the possible function of CD147 in SARS-CoV-2 invasion for host cells. Vero E6 cells were cultured in a 96-well plate, and CD147 on Vero E6 cells was blocked with Meplazumab. Then, the cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (100TCID 50 ) and the cell damage of Vero E6 and viral load were detected by crystal violet staining and quantitative PCR, respectively. Compared with the control group, the inhibitory rate for viruses was significantly increased in CD147-blocking group in a dose-dependent manner, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect (EC 50 ) of 24.86 μg/mL ( Figure 1A ) and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 15.16 μg/mL ( Figure 1B) . These results show that blocking CD147 on the host cells has an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an essential role of CD147 in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 invasion for host cells.

Identification of interaction between CD147 and SP

CD147 is closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 invasion for host cells, and SP binds to cellular receptors to mediate infection of host cells [7] , leading to the question whether there is some author/funder.

Therefore, the interaction assays was conducted to clarify the interaction of the two proteins. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assay confirmed the interaction of CD147 and SP (RBD), with an affinity constant of 1.85×10 -7 M (Figure 2A ). In Co-IP assay, anti-SP antibody and anti-CD147 antibody were used for antibody immobilization, respectively. The mIgG and rIgG were selected as negative control. Then, the mixture of His-CD147 and His-SP (RBD) was added in each group for IP, and the eluted protein was detected by western blot. The result showed that there was an interaction between CD147 and SP (RBD), which was consistent with the SPR assay ( Figure 2B ). In addition, the interaction of CD147-SP (RBD) was also confirmed by ELISA assay ( Figure 2C ). In the meanwhile, competitive inhibition assay showed that Meplazumab could competitively inhibit the binding of SP and CD147, with an IC 50 of 16.44 μg/mL ( Figure 2D ). These results confirm the interaction of CD147 and SP, indicating a novel potential route for SARS-CoV-2 to invade host cells.

Detection of localization of CD147 and SP by immuno-electron microscope

To further determine the localization of CD147 and SP in the process of viral infection, the Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 were observed by immune-electron microscope. After traced by 10 nm (CD147) and 20 nm (SP) gold colloid-labeled antibodies, we found that the two proteins mainly presented in viral inclusion bodies of Vero E6 cells ( Figure 3A -C). These results reinforce the finding that the CD147-SP interaction enhances viral invasion for host cells.

DISCUSSION

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread across the world has triggered a global health emergency. Patients with COVID-19 show abnormal findings on chest computed tomography, along with common symptoms that include cough, fever and fatigue [17] . Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis [18] . The pathological features of patients with COVID-19 are very similar to those of patients with SARS and MERS infection [19] . However, COVID-19 is more contagious than SARS and MERS [20] . Therefore, it is urgent to develop a specific antiviral drug against COVID-19.It is known that ACE2 has been widely recognized as an essential receptor in virus invasion, and viral replication was specifically inhibited by an anti-ACE2 antibody [21] . However, ACE2 is widely distributed in variety of tissues, especially in the heart, kidney and testes [22] , which plays a profound role in controlling blood pressure, preventing heart failure and kidney injury [23] [24] [25] . For lung diseases, the loss of ACE2 enhances vascular permeability and lung edema, activates the renin-angiotensin system and contributes to pathogenesis of severe lung injury [26] . Therefore, treatment with ACE2 as target may have a negative effect on its protective role.In our study, CD147 was identified as a novel receptor of SP, and the CD147-SP interaction facilitated the viral invasion for host cells. As mentioned earlier, CD147 is highly expressed in tumor tissues, inflamed tissues and pathogen infected cells, which leads to low cross-reaction with normal cells [27, 28] . In the meanwhile, Meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, could effectively inhibit the viruses from invading host cells by blocking CD147. Our previous research and development of original antibody drugs, such as Metuximab, Metuzumab, Meplazumab, all exhibits sound safety in preclinical research and clinical administration. Therefore, the CD147 targeted drug is safe and reliable in its application, and is a receptor-blocking drug, which blocks the virus from invading host cells, without being affected by virus variation. author/funder.

The route of CD147-SP facilitated SARS-CoV-2 invasion for host cells. Therefore, this route provides a novel target, with a good druggability, for specific antiviral drug development in the treatment of COVID-19. 

Cell culture

The cell lines (Vero E6 and 293T) have been tested and authenticated using Short Tandem Repeat DNA profiling by Beijing Microread Genetics Co., Ltd (Beijing, China) and were cultured at 37℃ under 5% CO 2 in DMEM or RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2% L-glutamine. 

SPR assay

SPR analysis was performed by BIAcore 3000 system (BIAcore). His-CD147 (produced by our laboratory) was fixed to the surface of CM5 sensor chips (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB) by amino coupling kit (GE Healthcare, BR-1000-50); interaction between CD147 and SP (RBD) (GenScript, China) was detected using Kinetic Analysis/Concentration Series/Direct Binding mode, and the flow rate was set to 15 μl/min, both binding time and dissociation time were 3 min. The results were analyzed by BIAevaluation software to determine the affinity constant.

Co-IP assay

Co-IP assay was performed using Pierce ® Co-Immunoprecipitation Kit (26149, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Anti-CD147 antibody (HAb18, produced by our laboratory) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody (40150-R007, Sino Biological, China) were used for antibody immobilization for Co-IP. The eluted proteins were detected by western blot. After boiling for 5-10 minutes, the eluted proteins were loaded to 12% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to PVDF author/funder. All rights reserved.

After blocking with 5% non-fat milk for 1 hour, the membrane was incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies (anti-CD147, HAb18, produced by our laboratory, dilution 1:2000; anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody, 40150-R007, Sino Biological, China, dilution 1:2000) at 4º C overnight. The images were developed after incubation with the secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) antibody, 31430, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA, dilution 1:5000; goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) antibody; 31460, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA, dilution 1:5000) at room temperature for 1 hour.

ELISA

ELISA assay was performed to identify the interaction of CD147 and SP. The His-SP (RBD) protein was coated on microplate, and then incubated with different concentrations of His-CD147 protein (2-fold dilution, 400-0.195 μg/mL) at 37°C for 1 hour. After washing with PBST, the samples were incubated with anti-CD147 antibody (HAb18, produced by our laboratory) for 1 hour; and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody for 1 hour. After coloration, the OD value at 450 nm was measured with a full-wavelength microplate reader (Epoch,BioTek Instruments, Inc.). The ability of Meplazumab to compete with SP for CD147 binding was performed by competitive inhibition ELISA. The protein His-CD147 was coated onto the wells of microplate, the mixture of His-SP (RBD) and Meplazumab ( 2-fold dilution, 200-0.781 µg/mL) was added and incubated. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody (40150-R007, Sino Biological, China) and then detected with HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody for 1 hour at 37°C, the following steps were similar to those described earlier.

Immuno-electron microscope

Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 were harvested and treated with fixative at 4°C . The sections of the cells were prepared through dehydration and embedding. After washing with ultrapure water, the sections were treated with 1% H 2 O 2 for 10 min. Having been blocked with goat serum for 30min, the sections was incubated with corresponding primary antibodies (anti-CD147, HAb18, produced by our laboratory, dilution 1:200; anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody, 40150-R007, Sino Biological, China, dilution 1:400) for 16 hours at 4º C overnight. Subsequently, the sections were washed with PBS for 5 min, and treated with PBS (containing 1% bovine serum albumin, BSA, pH 8.2) for 7 min. Then the gold colloid-labeling method was used to determine the localization of CD147 and SP for 1h at room temperature, and the sections were consecutively stained with 5% uranium acetate and lead acetate.Immune-electron microscope was used to observe the protein location.

"Abstract

COVID-19 pandemic has become a major threat to the country. Till date, well tested medication or antidote is not available to cure this disease. According to WHO reports, COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Analysis of this disease requires major attention by the Government to take necessary steps in reducing the effect of this global pandemic. In this study, outbreak of this disease has been analysed for India till 30 th March 2020 and predictions have been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks. SEIR model and Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30 th January 2020 to 30 th March 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the value of R 0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02. Expected cases may rise between 5000-6000 in the next two weeks of time. This study will help the Government and doctors in preparing their plans for the next two weeks. Based on the predictions for short-term interval, these models can be tuned for forecasting in long-term intervals.

","Introduction

The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a major global health threat. The Novel COVID-19 has been reported as the most detrimental respiratory virus since 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 situation report [1] as on March 27, 2020, a total of 509,164 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths have been reported across the world. Global spread has been rapid, with 170 countries now having reported at least one case. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Corona virus belongs to a family of viruses which is responsible for illness ranging from common cold to deadly diseases as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which were first discovered in China [2002] and Saudi Arabia [2012] . The 2019-novel Coronavirus or better known as COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China for the very first time on 31st December 2019. According to Jiang et al. [3] the fatality rate for this virus has been estimated to be 4.5% but for the age group 70-79 this has gone up to 8.0% while for those >80 it has been noted to be 14.8%. This has led to elderly persons above the age of 50 with underlying diseases like diabetes, Parkinson's disease and cardiovascular disease to be considered at the highest risk. Symptoms for this disease can take 2-14 days to appear and can range from fever, cough, shortness of breath to pneumonia, kidney failure and even death [1] . The transmission is person to person via respiratory droplets among close contact with the average number of people infected by a patient being 1.5 -3.5 but the virus is not considered airborne [2] . There exist a large number of evidences where machine learning algorithms have proven to give efficient predictions in healthcare [4] [5] [6] . Nsoesie et al. [7] has provided a systematic review of approaches used to forecast the dynamics of influenza pandemic. They have reviewed research papers based on deterministic mass action models, regression models, prediction rules, Bayesian network, SEIR model, ARIMA forecasting model etc. Recent studies on COVID-19 include only exploratory analysis of the available limited data [8] [9] [10] . Effective and well-tested vaccine against CoVID-19 has not been invented and hence a key part in managing this pandemic is to decrease the epidemic peak, also known as flattening the epidemic curve. The role of data scientists and data mining researchers is to integrate the related data and technology to better understand the virus and its characteristics, which can help in taking right decisions and concrete plan of actions. It will lead to a bigger picture in taking aggressive measures in developing infrastructure, facilities, vaccines and restraining similar epidemics in future. The objectives of the current study are as follows.1. Finding the rate of spread of the disease in India. 2. Developing a mathematical SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to evaluate the spread of disease. 3. Prediction of COVID-19 outbreak using SEIR and Regression models. After presenting background in Section I, Section II presents the methodology about the model used in this study. Section III covers analysis, experimental results and performance evaluation. Discussion has been provided in section IV followed by conclusion in section V.

Methodology

Time series data provided by John Hopkins University, USA has been used for the empirical result analysis [12] . The time period of data is from 30/01/2020 to 30/03/2020. The data includes confirmed cases, death cases and recovered cases of all countries. However, this paper focuses only on India's data for analysis and prediction of COVID-19 confirmed patients. The fact that India covers approximately 17.7% of the world's population and till date the effect of COVID-19 cases per million is less than 1, is the motivation behind this research. For analysis and prediction of number of COVID-19 patients in India, the following models have been used.

SEIR Model

Mathematical models can be designed to stimulate the effect of disease within many levels. These models can be used to evaluate disease from within the host model i.e. influence interaction within the cells of the host to metapopulation model i.e. how its spread in geographically separated populations. The most important part of this model is to calculate the R0 value. The value of R0 tells about the contagiousness of disease. It is the fundamental goal of epidemiologists studying a new case. In simple terms R0 determines an average of what number of people can be affected by a single infected person over a course of time. If the value of R0 < 1, this signifies the spread is expected to stop. If the value of R0 = 1, this signifies the spread is stable or endemic. If the value of R0 >, 1 this signifies the spread in increasing in the absence of intervention as shown in Figure 1 . Equation (1) calculates the percentage of the population needed to be vaccinated to stabilize the spread of disease..

Assuming the goal of R0 to be 0.5, the lower limit of the population required for the vaccine is 919.7 million and the upper limit would be 1.2071 billion. This remains a very vague figure so calculating the value of R0 remains an important part.The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049825 doi: medRxiv preprintHere, N = S + E + I + R is the total the population. Now, we can calculate the value of R0 using the formula in Equation 6 . The value of α, μ, , can be calculated using the ordinary deferential equations from the 4 component of the SEIR model.To describe the spread of COVID-19 using SEIR model, few consideration and assumptions were made due to limited availability of the data. They are enlisted as follows.1. Number of births and deaths remain same 2. 1/ is latent period of disease &1/ is infectious period 3. Recovered person was not sick again during the calculation period Now, considering 70% of India's population to be approximately 966 million in susceptible class (S) and assuming only 1 person got infected in the initial part with average incubation period of 5.2, average infectious period of 2.9 and R 0 equal to 4, the SEIR model without intervention is shown in Figure 3 with the assumptions mentioned above. In Figure 3 , we can examine that the number of susceptible population decreases by 80% in first 100 days as per the listed assumptions. The algorithm for SEIR model is shown as follows.The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049825 doi: medRxiv preprintThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049825 doi: medRxiv preprintThe copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049825 doi: medRxiv preprint Since we know COVID-19 is contagious and rate of transferring the disease from an infected person to susceptible person is 2.02 we need to predict the amount at which the disease can grow. Table 1 shows the prediction result using two models. In both the models, we have used 25 days training data as there was no significant trend in India before March 2020. To check the performance of the models used in this study we used root mean squared log error (RMSLE) and value RMSLE for the SEIR model was 1.52 and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. .

Figure 1. Demonstration of spread of disease on the basis of R 0 value

The SEIR model has mainly four components, viz. Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I) and Recovered (R) as shown in Figure 2 . S is the fraction of susceptible individuals (those able to contract the disease), E is the fraction of exposed individuals (those who have been infected but are not yet infectious), I is the fraction of infective individuals (those capable of transmitting the disease) and R is the fraction of recovered individuals (those who have become immune).

Figure 2. Illustration of SEIR model and its four components

In figure 2, is the infectious rate which represents the probability of disease transmitting to susceptible person from an infectious person; is incubation rate which represents latent rate at which a person becomes infectious; is the recovery rate which is determined by 1 (where D is duration of infection); and is the rate at which recovered people become susceptible due to low immunity or other health related issues. The ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for all these four parameters are shown in equations 2 to 5..

Regression Model

Regression models are statistical sets of processes which are used to estimate or predict the target or dependent variable on the basis of dependent variables. The regression model has many variants like linear regression, ridge regression, stepwise regression, polynomial regression etc. This study has used linear regression and polynomial regression for prediction of COVID-19 cases. Linear regression is a simple model which is used to finds the relation between a dependent and an independent variable. It uses the value of intercept and slope to predict the output variable. Equation 7 shows the relationship between a dependent and independent variable in a linear regression model. In Equation 7 , and are two independent variables which represent intercept and slope respectively and is the error rate. This creates a straight line and is mostly used for predictive analysis. To make the linear regression algorithm more accurate we try to minimize the sum of residual square between the predicted and actual value.Polynomial regression is a special type of regression which works on the curvilinear relationship between the dependent values and independent values. Equation 8 shows the relationship between a dependent and independent variable in polynomial regression. In Equation 8, x is the independent variable and is the bias also the intercept and , , ……, are the weight or partial coefficients assigned to the predictors and n is the degree of polynomial.The polynomial regression used in the study includes transformation of data into polynomials and applying linear regression to fit the parameter. A polynomial regression with degree equal to 1 is a linear regression.Choosing the value of a degree is a challenging task. If the degree of polynomial is less, it will not be able to fit the model properly and if the value of degree of polynomial is greater than actual, it will overfit the training data.

Results

In India, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 30 th January 2020. During the month of February, the number of cases reported was 3 and remained constant during the entire month. The major rise in the spread of disease started in the month of March'20. Figures 4 and 5 show the change in confirmed cases and death cases from 22 nd Jan 2020 to 30 th Mar 2020. Data from March shows a significant change in spread of the disease.

Figure 5. Change in number of death cases due to COVID-19 in India

In thecurrent analysis, we have used data till 25 th March 2020 as our training data and data from 25 th March 2020 -30 th March 2020 as the test/evaluation data. Before applying the prediction model we analysed the time series training data to check whether the model can fit the data or not. Figure 6 shows the result of confirmed cases in the log 10 base versus last 15 days of training data. The reason of using last 15 days of training data is because it shows major growth in confirmed cases as shown in Figure 4 .

Figure 6. Show the linear growth trend in India between 49 and 65 days

Then we trained our data with SEIR model and result of line of fitting is shown in Figure 7 . While applying SEIR, we took care of some interventions like quarantine and lockdown announced by the Government of India during this period so, we applied a decay function to lower the number of confirmed cases during prediction. We used hill decay in our model which is a half decay and its formula is given in Equation 9 , where L is a description of the rate of decay, T is time and k is a shape parameter (no dimension). Half decay functions never reach zero and have half their original efficacies at time L..

Discussion

The current trend shows that there will be a linear trend continued in the next few days as the control mechanisms taken by the Government of India are fairly strict and working well for the time being. Also, with linear trends, the patients getting recovered can be managed easily and death rate can be controlled as well. The findings of the current study may explode exponentially as shown by Gupta and Pal [13] if stringent control measures are not taken by the Government. Hospital provisions and medical facility enhancement work should be continued at a very rapid pace to prepare the country for exponential growth, if it occurs. However, with current interventions and preparations, the Government of India is looking forward to flatten the curve. During the prediction of the confirmed cases as shown in Table 1 , there were few challenges associated with the data. The data was not stationary and showed an exponential growth after 40 days from 22 nd Jan 2020 as shown in Figure 4 . Overfitting remains a major problem with disease spread time series data. In this model, we have addressed the overfitting problem using decay based intervention. Another problem faced in this study was shortage of training data. Data for 25 days was used for training purpose and 5 days data for validation, based on which the number of confirmed cases for next 14 days was predicted. The training data is very less for any machine learning to train itself . Also, rapid changes in number of infected cases occurred in mid-March. The SEIR model shows an advantage as it does not grow exponentially with time but also uses some intervention methods with time. For intervention, a hill decay model was used. In the case of a regression model, different features can be used for decaying or intervention eg. the number of cases recovered etc., but growth of the regression line still remains a problem. For a regression model, we always need to train the model after some time with the change in trend in the data. The SEIR model also uses some assumptions like the number of people in susceptible class, for which we have taken 70% of the population to susceptible class. In this study, we have only predicted the number of confirmed cases. To predict the number of death cases we faced many problems of data stationarity. Also, with limited data, the model was not able to predict the number of death cases properly. We have used only time series data for confirmed cases and death cases in this study. Using other data related to weather, geographic layout of the country, state-level population and governance parameters, the model prediction rate can be further improved..

Conclusion

In this study, two machine learning models SEIR and Regression were used to analyse and predict the change in spread of COVID-19 disease. We have analysed the data and found out that the number of cases per million in India is less than 0.5 till 30 th March 2020. Then, with the help of the SEIR model the value of R0 was computed to be 2.02. Also, we predicted the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for the next 14 days starting from 31 st March 2020 -13 th April 2020. During performance evaluation, our model computed the value of RMSLE for the SEIR model to be 1.52 and 1.75 for the regression model. Also, the value of spread of disease of R 0 was found to be 2.02. The result obtained from this study is taken from training data up to 30 th March 2020. Further, looking at the trend, there is definitely going to be an increase in the number of cases. Doctors, health workers and people involved in providing essential services have to be protected in accordance with prescribed medical norms. Community spreading in the future due to carelessness of individuals as well as groups can exponentially increase the number of cases. The peak is yet to come, hence the Government has to be extra vigil and enforce strict measures. In addition, provision of medical facilities across the country has to be aggressively enhanced. In future, an automated algorithm can be developed to fetch data in regular intervals and automatically predict the number of cases for weekly and biweekly data. In this way, Government and hospital facilities can also maintain a check on the supply and medical assistance / isolation required for new patients.

"Abstract

Delays in case reporting are common to disease surveillance systems, making it difficult to track diseases in real-time. ""Nowcast"" approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission-that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases-and are optimized to a single application, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to timevarying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting package. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package ""NobBS"") for widespread application.Achieving accurate, real-time estimates of disease activity is challenged by delays in case reporting. However, approaches that seek to estimate cases in spite of reporting delays often do not consider the temporal relationship between cases during an outbreak, nor do they identify characteristics of robust approaches that generalize to a wide range of surveillance contexts with very different reporting delays. Here, we present a smooth Bayesian nowcasting approach that produces accurate estimates that capture the time evolution of the epidemic curve and outperform a previous approach in the literature. We assess the performance for two diseases to identify important features of the reporting delay distribution that contribute to the model's performance and robustness across surveillance settings.All rights reserved.

","Introduction

Effective public health action relies on surveillance that is timely and accurate, especially in disease outbreaks (1, 2) . Specifically, surveillance provides the information required to assess risks, prioritize and allocate resources to public health threats, deploy and discontinue interventions to interrupt transmission, and monitor the impact of those interventions. Ideally, disease surveillance systems should closely track the often fast-changing circumstances of outbreaks, distinguishing true changes in the dynamics from artifacts of reporting.Despite the importance of timely surveillance data, substantial challenges exist to collect and report case information in real time. Multiple features of the disease and surveillance system contribute to reporting delays, including: delays in symptoms onset after infection; delays in medical care-seeking after onset; delays in providers obtaining and reporting diagnostic information; level of awareness of disease activity influencing care-seeking and reporting; and system-level processing delays, a result of complex and multi-tiered disease reporting and communication systems interacting at multiple administrative levels (3) . Reporting delays can be further exacerbated in resource-constrained settings. As a consequence, surveillance data are typically not complete until weeks or months after infections have actually occurred, providing an incomplete picture of current disease activity.Nowcasting, or ""predicting the present,"" is an approach to mitigate the impact of reporting delays. With origins in the insurance claims and actuarial literature (4, 5) , nowcast models aim to estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported events (e.g. insurance claims, disease cases) at any given time based on an incomplete set of reports. In public health settings, nowcasting approaches have been explored for AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s (6) (7) (8) as a consequence of the long incubation period from HIV infection until development of AIDS. More recently, nowcasting has been applied to infectious disease outbreaks such as foodborne illness outbreaks (9, 10) . These studies draw principally on survival analysis and actuarial techniques to model the reporting delay and draw inferences based on historical patterns. A majority of studies have strictly focused on modeling the reporting delay distribution-a legacy of the actuarial techniques giving rise to many of these approaches-and generally neglect a key feature of outbreaks: that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases, a fact that creates potentially strong autocorrelation in the true number of cases over short time intervals. In other words, the infectious disease transmission process provides an additional signal of the number of cases to be expected in the near future that has not been included in common methods such as the reverse-time hazard model (11, 12) and the chain ladder method (13). However, proposals to extend the latter approach to state-space models that account for temporal relationships in reporting have existed in the literature since the development of these techniques(13-15) and have been applied in at least one infectious disease context (16) . These developments are promising for disease surveillance, but it is critical to demonstrate performance in a diversity of settings as infectious disease nowcast models to date have largely focused on specific applications, not the common challenges that exist across many different diseases. In this investigation, we find that nowcasting is especially challenging when the proportion of cases reported the week they occur (delay 0) is low and reporting delays are highly variable; we know of no investigations that specifically identify models that perform well in these commonly occurring circumstances. As a result, the characteristics of robust and broadlyapplicable models are difficult to identify. Additionally, several previous models have largely focused on providing point estimates of the number of cases. Point estimates may be helpful, but quantifying the uncertainty in those estimates is even more important in the context of infectious disease outbreaks because uncertainty is intrinsic, and accounting for plausible outcomes apart from the point prediction is critical.Here, we introduce Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing (NobBS), a simple and flexible generalized Bayesian model for nowcasting infectious diseases in different settings. We demonstrate the robustness of this approach in two very different disease surveillance contexts and identify the conditions that favor its application, especially when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying. Specifically, NobBS allows for both uncertainty in the delay distribution and the time evolution of the epidemic curve, producing smooth, time-correlated estimates of cases. We demonstrate that NobBS performs well for weekly nowcasts of (1) dengue cases in Puerto Rico and (2) influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in the United States, requiring no disease-specific parameterization despite the two pathogens being very different (vector-borne vs. directly transmitted) and exhibiting substantially different reporting delays. Lastly, we test NobBS against a previous Bayesian nowcast method (9) and find that NobBS outperforms this benchmark for both diseases and multiple time periods. In particular, we show that while point estimates of the models are similar when time-to-report distributions are relatively fixed over time, NobBS improves the estimation of uncertainty and accommodates temporal variation in delay probabilities. We present an R package, ""NobBS,"" as a tool to complement both routine public health surveillance as well as forecasting efforts.

Results

We developed a Bayesian approach to nowcast total case numbers using incomplete, timestamped reported case data based on an estimated delay distribution, intrinsic autocorrelation from the transmission process, and historical case data. Generally, the approach learns from historical information on cases reported at multiple delays (e.g. no delay, 1-week delay, 2-week delay, etc.) from the week of case onset to estimate the reporting delay probability at each delay and the relationship between case counts from week-to-week, and uses this relationship to predict the number of not-yet-reported cases in the present. We tested this approach, NobBS, using two different infectious disease surveillance data sources: dengue surveillance in Puerto Rico, and national notifications of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States. Using all of the available data on case reporting delays up to the point of prediction, weekly dengue nowcasts were estimated for the time period December 23, 1991 through November 29, 2010 (989 weeks), and weekly ILI nowcasts were produced over the period June 30, 2014 through September 25, 2017 (170 weeks). For comparison, we generated weekly nowcasts over the same periods using an existing Bayesian approach, here referred to as the benchmark approach (9). To leverage a large amount of historical data to fit the nowcast model while also having a large window over which to assess nowcasts, we used a 104-week (approximately 2-y) moving window dengue and a 27-week (approximately 6-mo) moving window for ILI. Our primary outcome metric to assess nowcast performance was the logarithmic score, a proper score that evaluates the probability assigned to the observed outcome rather than error associated with a point prediction. For purposes of discussion, we reported the exponentiated form of the mean logarithmic score (the geometric mean of the assigned probabilities) to provide a metric on the scale of 0 (no certainty of the outcome) to 1 (complete certainty of the outcome). In addition, we estimated other metrics describing the performance of point estimates (mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative root mean square error (rRMSE)) and the 95% prediction interval (PI) coverage, and of these, focus on comparing the rRMSE and 95% PI coverage across approaches.

Performance in forecasting weekly dengue and influenza incidence

Figs. 1-2 show weekly dengue and ILI nowcasts for NobBS and the benchmark approach over multiple seasons for both diseases. Table 1 summarizes the point and probability-based accuracy metrics for each, where higher accuracy is indicated by higher average scores, lower MAE, RMSE, and rRMSE, and lower distance from 0.95 for the 95% PI coverage. Because the NobBS model accounts for both under-reporting and the autocorrelated progression of transmission across successive weeks, it makes predictions even in weeks when there are no cases reported for the week. Conversely, the benchmark model does not make nowcasts for weeks in which there are no initial case reports (common in the dengue Puerto Rico data), hence the nowcasts in Figs. 1C and 2C appear as discontinuous lines. To compare models despite these differences, we report accuracy metrics between NobBS and the benchmark approach for both (1) the full time series of the data and (2) weeks when at least one case was reported in the first week, i.e. the subset of weeks for which both models could make predictions (Table 1) . We also computed error metrics for the benchmark model for the full time series by assigning point estimates of 0 cases for nowcasts in weeks without predictions. accuracy, as measured by the log score and the prediction error, are compared to (C) nowcasts by the benchmark approach with (D) corresponding log scores and prediction errors. For nowcasting, the number of newly-reported cases each week (blue line) are the only data available in real-time for that week, and help inform the estimate of the total number of cases that will be eventually reported (red line), shown with 95% prediction intervals (pink bands). The true number of cases eventually reported (black line) is known only in hindsight and is the nowcast target. Historical information on reporting is available within a 104-week moving window (grey shade) and used to make nowcasts. The log score (brown line) and the difference between the true and mean estimated number of cases (grey line) are shown as a function of time.All rights reserved.

Performance measures for each nowcast approach and disease.The benchmark approach made predictions in only 55% of weeks in the dengue time series (Table 1 ). In this subset of weeks, the NobBS approach achieved relatively smooth and accurate tracking of the dengue time series (rRMSE = 0.464, average score = 0.274) despite low proportions of cases reported on the week of onset ( Fig. 1A -B). The 95% PI coverage was 0.85, indicating that the 95% PI included the true number of cases for 85% of the nowcasts. In comparison, the benchmark approach produced substantially less accurate point estimates and slightly broader uncertainty intervals (rRMSE = 1.24, average score = 0.161, 95% PI coverage = 0.90) with greater fluctuation in nowcasts from week-to-week ( Fig. 1C-D) . Because many weeks in the dengue data were low incidence, assigning a prediction of 0 to the benchmark approach's missing nowcasts improved its rRMSE to 1.14 in the full time series compared to 1.24 for the subset over which nowcasts were generated from the model, though NobBS still surpassed the benchmark model's accuracy on this and all other metrics (Table 1) .Nowcast point estimates tracked the ILI time series well for both approaches, though point estimates had greater error by all measures for the NobBS approach (NobBS rRMSE = 0.074 vs. benchmark rRMSE = 0.062; Table 1 ). However, the NobBS approach produced considerably wider prediction intervals (Figs. 1C, 2C) resulting in both higher log scores (NobBS average score = 0.218 vs. benchmark average score = 0.017) and 100% coverage by the 95% prediction intervals compared to 0% coverage for the benchmark (Table 1) .To assess the degree of autocorrelation and related smoothness in the NobBS predictions, we calculated the 1-week lagged autocorrelation of predictions (ρ a ) and compared this to the 1week lagged autocorrelation of cases (ρc). In addition, we computed metrics reflecting the accuracy of the approaches in capturing the change in cases from week-to-week: the mean absolute error of the change (MAEΔ) and the RMSE of the change (RMSEΔ) ( Table 2 ). The magnitude of change was much larger for the ILI data than dengue data, with average absolute value change of 1,312.6 cases/week versus 9.8 cases/week, yet both showed high autocorrelation (ρc = 0.958 for dengue and ρc = 0.972 for ILI). Comparing the full time series, the nowcasts produced by NobBS exhibited high autocorrelation for both diseases (ρ a = 0.876 for dengue, 0.973 for ILI) while the benchmark approach yielded lower autocorrelation for dengue nowcasts, comparatively (ρa = 0.631 for dengue, 0.970 for ILI). For dengue, over the weeks in which at least 1 case was initially reported, the NobBS approach achieved both lower mean absolute difference between predicted and observed changes in cases (NobBS MAEΔ = 23 vs. benchmark MAEΔ = 50) and lower RMSE of the change (NobBS RMSEΔ = 35.8 vs. benchmark RMSEΔ = 64.6). In addition, NobBS outperformed the benchmark approach over the full time series of dengue cases ( Table 2 ). For ILI, however, the metrics for the weekly change were similar for the two approaches (Table 2) .

Reporting delays impact nowcast performance

The delay distributions between the reporting systems are strikingly different (Figs. 1, 2, S1). In the case of the dengue surveillance system, which includes specimen collection and laboratory testing, only approximately 4% of cases were processed during the week of onset, on average. In contrast, the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness (ILI) Surveillance Network (ILINet) captures only syndromic data reported electronically, with over 80% of ILI cases reported, on average, the same week they present (i.e. with no delay). Overall, we observed that the accuracy of nowcast point estimates (rRMSE) was higher for the ILI data compared to dengue, which may be related to the high proportion of cases reported with 0-weeks delay in these data. Large weekly absolute changes in the number of initial case reports also appeared to be related to increased error, particularly for dengue, which had high fluctuations in the number of initial reports over time (Table S1 , Fig. S2 ). Note that because of the difference in predictive distribution bin widths based on the number of cases that accrue for influenza vs. dengue (Materials & Methods), average scores are not comparable across diseases.

NobBS improves nowcasting with varying reporting delays

Dengue and ILI also exhibit differences in the trends of reporting delay probabilities over time. For dengue, we observe a noisier, more time-varying probability of reporting for cases, with more extreme fluctuations in the proportion of initial reports compared to ILI cases, which show more constant (tighter ranges of) reporting probabilities from week-to-week (Fig. S3) . Independent of the initial proportion of cases reported (high vs. low), we hypothesized that these trends (relatively constant vs. time-varying) are particularly impactful on the performance of the nowcast, and that relatively constant reporting probabilities, as seen in the ILI data, may be linked to the higher accuracy of these predictions.To test the robustness of the model, we simulated ILI data using the final counts from the true dataset, but imposing a time-varying delay distribution; specifically, with faster initial reporting during weeks of high incidence (described in Materials and Methods). Using these simulated data, we found that NobBS was relatively robust to changes in reporting delays (Fig. S4 , Table  S2 ). In the context of stable reporting delays (original ILI data), NobBS performed comparably to the benchmark model (Fig. 2, Table 1 ). However, in the presence of simulated time-varying reporting delays, NobBS outperformed the benchmark in terms of confidence (NobBS average score = 0.06 vs. benchmark average score ≈ 0), point estimates (NobBS rRMSE = 0.302 vs. benchmark rRMSE = 0.621), and accuracy of the predicted change (Table S3) . Such variations are a reality in many epidemics (17) .

Performance by year

The performance of ILI nowcasts across accuracy measures was relatively consistent by year, but there were fluctuations in the year-to-year performance of both approaches applied to dengue data (Table 3) . Average scores tended to be high in years that experienced a very low number of dengue cases (e.g. 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006) . The model was particularly effective at identifying periods of low incidence, with high probabilities assigned to the lowest outcome bin (0-25 cases, details in Materials and Methods) when the number of cases eventually reported was low (Fig. S5) . On the other hand, during periods of high dengue activity, lower probabilities were assigned to the correct bin, reflecting greater uncertainty. Overall, NobBS outperformed the benchmark approach on all performance measures for each year (Table 3) . 0.17 across the NobBS and benchmark approaches, falling clearly below the rest of the years in performance. These scores not only reflect unusually poor point estimate predictions as judged by rRMSE, but also the finding that the predictive distribution for weeks in these years for both approaches rarely included the true value of interest (a consequence of dramatic over-or underestimates).

Moving window sizes

We initially used moving windows of 104 weeks for dengue (a longer time series) and 27 weeks for ILI (a shorter time series) to leverage a large number of historical training weeks to train nowcast estimates. Moving windows allow for stable estimation of the recent delay distribution as information from very old and potentially less relevant weeks are forgotten. The size of the moving window reflects how quickly and smoothly changes in the data should be realized by the model: longer moving windows tend to produce smoother estimates, but the model may be less sensitive to abrupt changes in the data (e.g. changes in how quickly cases are reported during an outbreak) or shorter-interval secular trends, e.g. seasonality.While we chose long moving windows to capitalize on data availability, these considerations may affect the choice of moving window size and nowcast performance, depending on the data. In light of this, we experimented with moving windows of different lengths to assess the impact on nowcast performance with dengue data. We tested moving windows of 5, 12, and 27 weeks (approx. 6 months). A 5-week moving window produced substantially lower accuracy nowcasts (rRMSE = 7.381) with several steep case overestimates in 2007-08 and 2010 (Fig. S6A) . However, accuracy metrics for moving windows of 12 weeks or longer were similar to those using the full 104 week window (range in rRMSE: 0.6-0.655; average score: 0.35-0.37) (Table  S4 ; Fig. S6 ). While shorter moving windows often produced more accurate estimates of the reporting delay probability (Fig. S7A) , the estimated variance of the random walk process varied dramatically from week-to-week (Fig. S7B ) resulting in more dramatic overestimates at certain periods of extreme time-varying delays, suggesting a trade-off between delay estimation accuracy and more stable estimates of weekly cases.

Discussion

We introduce a new approach for Bayesian nowcasting and demonstrate its application in two disease contexts with different reporting systems, outperforming an existing method in terms of point estimate (reduced RMSE) and probabilistic (higher logarithmic score) predictive performance. In particular, NobBS performs well even when the delays in case reporting change over time. We further demonstrate an important trade-off related to moving window sizes for delay distribution estimates; short windows improve the real-time characterization of the delay distribution but are susceptible to over-estimating that variability, potentially decreasing nowcast accuracy. Lacking any disease-specific parameterization, and relying only on historical trends of case reporting as input, this approach can be immediately adapted in a variety of disease settings.Across diseases, NobBS outperformed the benchmark approach on accuracy of uncertainty estimates, and produced comparable or better point estimates. For the subset of weeks in which All rights reserved.

However, analysis of the probability distributions of the nowcasts revealed a much more substantial difference; the average score for NobBS was approximately twice as high for dengue and more than 10 times as high for ILI cases (Table 1 ). This indicates that the NobBS approach assigned much higher probability to the actual outcome, even though point accuracy was somewhat lower for the ILI cases.While utilizing a similar modeling structure for case reporting delays as the benchmark model (9) , NobBS introduces a simple dependency between case counts over time; that is, changes in case counts between weeks are assumed to be related via a first-order random walk process on the logarithmic scale. This feature is critical in the context of infectious disease transmission, where the number of true infections in a given week mechanistically depends in part on the number of true infections in previous weeks due to the infectious process, whether the pathogen is transmitted directly or by vectors (18) . Hence, variations of autoregressive models are common in disease forecasting (19, 20) . When reporting delays are time-varying, as is often the case in epidemics (17), we show that the NobBS approach is less accurate compared to its performance in a stable delay distribution, but still shows improvement over the benchmark approach likely because the NobBS approach is informed by the number of cases experienced in previous weeks, not just the delay distribution, making it more robust to larger fluctuations.The accuracy of predictions is related at least in part to the number of cases reported to the surveillance system in week 0. When a larger proportion of cases were reported with no delay, as was the case for ILI compared to dengue, the point estimate accuracy was higher. This is not surprising, as a large fraction of true cases reported initially leaves fewer cases left to predict.We observed greater volatility in the nowcasts when the initial number of cases reported increases suddenly from low values. Two weeks in the dengue time series highlight this: August 3, 1998 and August 16, 2010. In those weeks, the number of cases initially increased by 16 and 17, respectively, from the previous week after 10 week with an average absolute change of 2.6 and 1.8 cases, respectively. Because this increase is an outlier in the distribution of reporting delays, in particular for delay d=0, the model substantially overestimated the true number of cases before correcting the following week. We observed that shorter moving windows either exacerbated this issue (e.g. in 2010) or produced a similar overestimate (e.g. in 1998) (Fig. S6 ), which appears to be a consequence of the volatility in estimating the variance of the random walk process, despite more accurate estimation of the reporting delay probability (Fig. S7) . While the smooth, autocorrelated relationship fit in the NobBS model helps reduce the effect of week-to-week variability in early reporting, it remains a challenge. Users should keep in mind these trade-offs when seeking to apply NobBS to their data.While NobBS mitigates the effects of a time-varying delay distribution on case estimation, i.e. that the history of cases is leveraged to anchor case estimates to recent values, it does not explicitly model temporal changes in that delay; in other words, the estimated probability of a case occurring with delay = d is assumed to apply to all reporting weeks in the moving window. Shorter moving windows can improve estimation of the delay in the presence of changes, but explicitly estimating changes in that distribution may be explored for additional robustness in the presence of systemic changes in reporting. For example, authors in (21) propose a smooth estimate of the time-varying reporting delay distribution using p-spline smoothing. Specifying a time-specific change has also been proposed (9), but empirical identification of a change point in real-time may be challenging or impossible in the context of nowcasting. The challenge that remains in all described approaches is the ability of the model to pick up on changes in the delay distribution that occur quickly, in other words that may otherwise be smoothed out by splines and long moving windows.Beyond supporting real-time disease tracking by public health officials, NobBS can complement existing disease forecast efforts by providing more accurate nowcasts to forecasting teams in the place of real-time reporting underestimates. For example, teams participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Epidemic Prediction Initiative (https://predict.cdc.gov) challenges (e.g. FluSight) use initial surveillance data for forecasting because it is the most upto-date data available (22) . NobBS can help account for later revisions to these data and therefore improve prospective estimates as well.We present an R package, ""NobBS,"" intended to provide easy and flexible implementation of this approach to a wide audience of public health officials and researchers. This package is currently being finalized and is installable from https://github.com/sarahhbellum/NobBS, and will be moved to CRAN in final form.

Surveillance Data

We collected data on approximately 53,000 cases of dengue in Puerto Rico and 2.77 million cases of ILI in the United States over a 21-year (1092 weeks) and 3.75-year (196 weeks) period, respectively. Time-stamped weekly dengue data for laboratory-confirmed cases of dengue in Puerto Rico were collected by the Puerto Rico Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The times used for the analysis were the time of onset as reported by the reporting clinician and the time of laboratory report completion. ILI data originated from the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), which consolidates information from over 2000 outpatient healthcare providers in the United States who report to the CDC on the number of patients with ILI. The times used for the analysis were the week of ILI-related care seeking and the week when those cases were posted online in FluView (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html) as collected in the DELPHI epidemiological data API (https://github.com/cmu-delphi/delphi-epidata). ILI data with delays of more than 6 months occasionally had irregularities, so we restricted the analyses to delays of up to 6 months.Delays in reporting are often structurally decomposed into a (T x D) dimensional ""reporting triangle,"" where T is the most recent week (""now"") and D is the maximum reporting delay, in weeks, observed in the data. The data are right-truncated, since at any given week t, delays longer than Tt cannot be observed. For example, at week t=T, only the cases reported with delay d=0 are observable; cases reported with longer delays (i.e. 1-or 2-week delays, d=1 or d=2) will be known in future weeks. In Table S5 , we present an example of the reporting triangle using ILI data.For each week t, the goal of nowcasting is to produce estimates for the total number of cases eventually reported, Nt, based on an incomplete set of observed cases with delay d, nt,d. Since not every nt,d is observed for a delay d, but will be observed at some unknown time point in the future, Nt = sum(nt,d).Our approach is motivated by modeling the marginal cell counts of the reporting triangle, nt,d in an adaptation of the loglinear chain ladder method developed in actuarial literature (13, 14) .

Bayesian Nowcast Model

Let nt,d be the number of cases reported for week t with delay d. We assume that the underlying cases occur in a Poisson process such that , ~ ( , ).We also allow for extra-Poisson variation, that is, when the variance is larger than the mean and a negative binomial process (of which the Poisson is a special case) is more appropriate. We apply this in the case of the influenza data:, ~ ( , , ) where , = /( + , ).We then model the mean, , , as a simple log-linear equationwhere represents the true epidemiologic signal for week t and as the probability of reporting with delay=d. In other words, NobBS contains random effects for week t and the reporting delay d. Exponentiating both sides of the equation, , = * .We place prior distributions on and reflecting properties of each parameter. Since represents a probability vector containing delays = 0, …, D, we place on it a Dirichlet prior of length D:The maximum delay D can be identified as the maximum observable delay in the data, which may change as the time series extends, or can be fixed at some value D thought to represent a very long delay. In the latter case, can be modeled as the probability of delay ≥ D. For dengue, we choose to fix D at 10 weeks, since over 99% of the cases observed in the first two years (prior to producing out-of-sample nowcasts) were reported within 10 weeks. For influenza, we chose D to be the longest possible delay within the 27-week moving window, or D=26. The implications of choosing a maximum delay D within a moving window of W weeks means that the nowcast will include all cases arising with delays greater than or equal to D but less than or equal to W, thus excluding all cases with delays greater than W (see the reporting triangle in Table S5 ).We place weakly informative priors on representing a small number of hypothetical total cases (n=10) distributed across delay bins, loosely representing the probability of reporting delays for each delay d observed in the first two years of data for dengue and the first 6 months of data for ILI (training periods). As a sensitivity, we also placed weak priors on treating all delays with equal probability, but there was no material difference in the results (Table S6) .We allow a dependency between successive 's to capture the time evolution and autocorrelation of cases from week-to-week, commonly exhibited by epidemic curves. We therefore model as a first-order random walk:Because is in natural log form, this constitutes a geometric random walk.We place weakly informative priors on the precisions of the Normal distribution, 2~( 0.01, 0.01). For the negative binomial stopping-time parameter, r, we place an informative Ga(60,20) prior to reflect belief that the process deviates moderately from the Poisson.Models were compiled in JAGS on R (v 3.3.2) producing 10,000 posterior"
"Abstract

In this study, we reported for the first time the existence of complemented palindrome small RNAs 26 (cpsRNAs) and proposed cpsRNAs and palindrome small RNAs (psRNAs) as a novel class of small RNAs. 27The first discovered cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA from SARS coronavirus named SARS-28CoV-cpsR-22 contained 22 nucleotides perfectly matching its reverse complementary sequence. Further 29 sequence analysis supported that SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 originated from bat betacoronavirus. The results of 30 RNAi experiments showed that one 19-nt segment of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 significantly induced cell 31 apoptosis. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 could play a role in SARS-CoV infection or 32 pathogenicity. The discovery of psRNAs and cpsRNAs paved the way to find new markers for pathogen 33 detection and reveal the mechanisms in the infection or pathogenicity from a different point of view. The 34 discovery of psRNAs and cpsRNAs also broaden the understanding of palindrome motifs in animal of plant 35 genomes.

In this study, we reported for the first time the existence of complemented palindrome small RNAs 26 (cpsRNAs) and proposed cpsRNAs and palindrome small RNAs (psRNAs) as a novel class of small RNAs. 27The first discovered cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA from SARS coronavirus named CoV-cpsR-22 contained 22 nucleotides perfectly matching its reverse complementary sequence. Small RNA sequencing (small RNA-seq or sRNA-seq) is used to acquire thousands of short RNA 58 sequences with lengths of usually less than 50 bp. With sRNA-seq, many novel non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) 59 have been discovered. For example, two featured series of rRNA-derived RNA fragments (rRFs) constitute a 60 novel class of small RNAs [1] . Small RNA-seq has also been used for virus detection in plants [2] [3] [4] and 61invertebrates [5] . In 2016, Wang et al. first used sRNA-seq data from the NCBI SRA database to prove that 62 sRNA-seq can be used to detect and identify human viruses [6] , but the detection results were not as good as 63 those of plant or invertebrate viruses. To improve virus detection in mammals, our strategy was to detect and 64 compare featured RNA fragments in plants, invertebrates and mammals using sRNA-seq data. In one 65 previous study [7] , we detected siRNA duplexes induced by plant viruses and analyzed these siRNA 66 duplexes as an important class of featured RNA fragments. In this study, we detected siRNA duplexes 67 induced by invertebrate and mammal viruses a n d unexpectedly discovered another important class of 68 featured RNA fragments, which were complemented palindrome small RNAs (cpsRNAs). Among all the 69 detected cpsRNAs, we found a typical 22-nt cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA from SARS 70 coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strain MA15, which deserved further studies because mice infected with SARS-71CoV MA15 died from an overwhelming viral infection with virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes 72 and ciliated epithelial cells [8] . Although the palindromic motif TCTTTAACAAGCTTGTTAAAGA was 73 already observed in a previous study [9] , it never be considered to be transcribed as cpsRNAs before our 74 studies. 75The first discovered cpsRNA named SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 contained 22 nucleotides perfectly 76 matching its reverse complementary sequence. In our previous study of mitochondrial genomes, we had 77 reported for the first time a 20-nt palindrome small RNA (psRNA) named hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 [10]. The 78 biological functions of hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 had been preliminarily studied in our previous study, while the 79 biological functions of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 were still unknown. In this study, we compared the features of 80 siRNA duplexes induced by mammal viruses with those induced by plant and invertebrate viruses and found 81 that siRNA duplexes induced by mammal viruses had significantly lower percentages of total sequenced 82 reads and it seemed that they were only produced from a few sites on the virus genomes. One possible 83 reason could be a large proportion of sRNA-seq data is from other small RNA fragments caused by the 84 presence of a number of dsRNA-triggered nonspecific responses such as the type I interferon (IFN) 85 synthesis [11] . Another possible reason could be the missing siRNA duplexes or siRNA fragments functions 86 in cells by interaction with host RNAs or proteins. Based on this idea, we suspected that SARS-CoV-cpsR-87 22 could play a role in SARS-CoV infection or pathogenicity. Then, we performed RNAi experiments to test 88 the cellular effects induced by SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 and its segments. 89In this study, we reported for the first time the existence of cpsRNAs. Further sequence analysis 90 supported that SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 could originate from bat betacoronaviruses. The results of RNAi 91 .

Comparison of siRNA-duplexes induced by plant, invertebrate and mammal viruses 99

In this study, 11 invertebrate viruses were detected using 51 runs of sRNA-seq data (Supplementary 100 file 1) and two mammal viruses (H1N1 and SARS-CoV) were detected using 12 runs of sRNA-seq data. In 101 our previous study, six mammal viruses were detected using 36 runs of sRNA-seq data [6] . The detection of 102 siRNA-duplexes by 11 invertebrate and eight mammal viruses was performed using a published program in 103 our previous study [7] . Then, we compared the features of siRNA duplexes induced by invertebrate viruses 104 ( Figure 1A ) with those induced by plant viruses ( Figure 1B) . The results showed that the duplex length was 105 the principal factor to determine the read count in both plants and invertebrates. 21-nt siRNA duplexes were 106 the most abundant duplexes in both plants and invertebrates, followed by 22-nt siRNA duplexes in plants 107 but 20-nt siRNA duplexes in invertebrates. 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 2-nt overhangs were the most 108 abundant 21-nt duplexes in plants, while 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 1-nt overhangs were the most abundant 109 21-nt duplexes in invertebrates but they had a very close read count to that of 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 2-110 nt overhangs. 18-nt, 19-nt, 20-nt and 22-nt siRNA duplexes in invertebrates had much higher percentages of 111 total sequenced reads that those in plants. In addition, 18-nt and 19-nt siRNA duplexes had very close read 112 counts and 20-nt and 22-nt siRNA duplexes had very close read counts in invertebrates. Since siRNA 113 duplexes induced by mammal viruses had significantly lower percentages of total sequenced reads, the 114 comparison of siRNA-duplex features between mammals and invertebrates/or plants could not provide 115 meaningful results using the existing public data with standard sequencing depth. However, as an 116 unexpected result from siRNA-duplex analysis, we discovered cpsRNAs from invertebrate and mammal 117 viruses. 118One typical cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA (DQ497008: 25962-25983) located in the 119 orf3b gene on the SARS-CoV strain MA15 genome was detected in four runs of sRNA-seq data (SRA: 120 SRR452404, SRR452406, SRR452408 and SRR452410). This cpsRNA was named SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, 121 which contained 22 nucleotides perfectly matching its reverse complementary sequence (Figure 2A) . We 122 also detected one 18-nt and one 19-nt segment of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, which could also be derived from 123 siRNA duplexes ( Figure 2B ) but their strands (positive or negative) could not be determined. Among 124 SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 and its two segments, the 19-nt segment was the most abundant and the 22-nt SARS-125CoV-cpsR-22 was the least abundant. 126 .

Discovery of psRNAs and cpsRNAs 128

Palindromic motifs are found in published genomes of most species and play important roles in 129 biological processes. The well-known samples of palindromic DNA motifs include restriction enzyme sites, 130 methylation sites and palindromic motifs in T cell receptors [12] . In this study, we found that palindromic or 131 complemented palindrome small RNAs motifs existed ubiquitously in animal virus genomes, but not all of 132 them were detected to be transcribed and processed into cpsRNAs probably due to inadequate sequencing 133 depth of the sRNA-seq data. For example, we only found two psRNAs ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/185876 doi: bioRxiv preprint

Datasets and data analysis 200

All sRNA-seq data were downloaded from the NCBI SRA database. The invertebrate and mammal 201 viruses were detected from sRNA-seq data using VirusDetect [4] and their genome sequences were 202 downloaed from the NCBI GenBank database. The description of sRNA-seq data and virus genomes is 203 presented in Supplementary file 1. The cleaning and quality control of sRNA-seq data were performed 204 using the pipeline Fastq_clean [15] that was optimized to clean the raw reads from Illumina platforms. 205Using the software bowtie v0.12.7 with one mismatch, we aligned all the cleaned sRNA-seq reads to viral 206 genome sequences and obtained alignment results in SAM format for detection of siRNA duplexes using the 207 program duplexfinder [7] . Statistical computation and plotting were performed using the software R v2.15.3 208 with the Bioconductor packages [16] . The orf3b gene from human betacoronavirus (GenBank: 209 DQ497008.1), its 20 homologous sequences from bat betacoronavirus and nine homologous sequences from 210 civet betacoronavirus were aligned using ClustalW2 (Supplementary file 2) . After removal of identical 211 sequences, the orf3b gene from human betacoronavirus, eight homologous sequences from bat 212 betacoronavirus and two homologous sequences from civet betacoronavirus were used for phylogenetic 213 analysis. Since these homologous sequences had high identities (from 85.16% to 99.78%) to the orf3b gene 214 from DQ497008, the Neighbor Joining (NJ) method was used for phylogenetic analysis. 215 216

RNAi and cellular experiments 217

Based on the shRNA design protocol [1], the sequences of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, its 16-nt, 18-nt, 19-nt 218 20-nt segments ( Figure 2B ) and their control ""CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA"" were selected to use as 219 target sequences for pSIREN-RetroQ vector construction (Clontech, USA), respectively. PC-9 cells were 220 divided into six groups named 22, 16, 18, 19, 20 and control for transfection using plasmids containing 221 20 -nt segments and control sequences. Each group had three 222 replicate samples for plasmid transfection and cell apoptosis measurement. Each sample was processed 223 following the same procedure described below.

"Abstract

Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is an emerging, highly contagious community acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Highly efficient and accurate microbiological laboratory assay is essential to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection, rule out other pathogens that can cause CAP, and monitor secondary infections. Here, we enrolled and provide microbiological analysis for 129 suspected and 52 transferred confirmed NCP patients hospitalized in the First Affiliated

","

swab samples (sputum and pharyngeal) from 129 suspected patients with realtime RT-PCR, we confirmed 33 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with two co-infection cases with adenovirus or rhinovirus. We also used multiplex PCR to detect 13 common respiratory tract pathogens in 96 non-NCP patients, and found that 30 patients (31.25%) were infected with at least one respiratory tract pathogen that may cause CAP. Further, we performed bacterial and fungal cultures as well as fungal serologic tests and found that there is no secondary bacterial/fungal infections in confirmed NCP patients. Our studies suggest that, during the epidemic of NCP in Anhui province, there was a certain proportion of infection and co-infection of other common pathogens of CAP, and the secondary bacterial and fungal infection is not detectable in NCP patients. In comparison with SARS-CoV-2 detection alone, this optimized strategy combining multiple pathogen detection for identification of NCP and other CAP patients as well as cultures and serologic tests for confirmed patients increases the diagnosis efficiency and facilitates the personalized medication.

Introduction

In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown origins were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and a novel beta-coronavirus was subsequently identified from the respiratory specimens of the patients by High-throughput sequencing [1] . The virus was confirmed as the cause of the unexplained pneumonia and named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has resulted in a rapid outbreak throughout China and global spread, and posed a significant threat to public health [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . According to a recent study, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-cov) [7] . In the meantime, the infection by the virus could cause substantial critical conditions (14.8%~15.74%), as well as significant mortality (1.4%~14.6%) [8] [9] [10] . Therefore, early diagnosis, early isolation and early management are crucial to curb rapid spread of the virus and improve the prognosis of the patients [11] .Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is an emerging community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The clinical symptoms of NCP include fever, dry cough, muscle pain and so on [8] . Ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing were the radiological features of the NCP patients [8, 12] . Whereas some pathogens, such as RSV, parainfluenza virus may share similar imaging features ( Figure 1 ). SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test is recommended as the standard for diagnosis of the disease.However, this method is often affected by many factors such as sample collection and reagent quality. False negative results could occur, resulting in delayed or missed diagnosis [9] . In this study, both sputum and pharyngeal swab samples were collected, then mixed and detected for SARS-CoV-2 using two different real-time RT-PCR reagents, which significantly improved the positive rate of detection.The winter is the season of high incidence of CAP, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection can't clearly suggest which pathogen is responsible for the SARS-CoV-2 negative patients, nor can it determine whether the positive patients have co-infection.In order to improve the etiological diagnosis, 13 different respiratory tract pathogens .

According to the Chinese ""New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control

Program"" [13] , a second nucleic acid test is performed after 24 hours, and only when both nucleic acid test results are negative can the patient be discharged. The average hospitalization time of NCP patients was reported more than 14 days [14] . In order to monitor whether secondary nosocomial infection occurs during hospitalization, we used bacterial and fungal cultures and fungal serological tests to monitor secondary infection in hospitalized patients with fever, increased sputum and increased inflammatory factors.In this study, we used different microbiological laboratory detection strategies for Program"" [13] . Written consents were obtained from all of the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC.

Total RNA was extracted from specimens using an automatic nucleic acid extraction instrument (TANBead, China), SARS-CoV-2 was then detected by real-time RT-PCR using two different detection kits. One kit selected ORF1ab gene as the target sequence for detection (Beijing Genomics Institution, China), and the other one usedORF1ab, E gene and N gene as the target sequences (Bioperfectus technologies, China). In brief, the total RNA was added to the reaction reagent and dual fluorescence PCR (Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems, USA) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. If the first SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR result is negative, the respiratory specimens will be collected again after 24 hours for another test. .

When the blood culture system reported positive, the corresponding blood sample was then subcultured onto blood agar and sabouraud agar plates. Plates were held at 35 ℃ for 2 days and checked for colony formation. He was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, severe respiratory failure and cerebral apoplexy. One day after admission to our intensive care unit (ICU), the patient died from a sudden cardiac arrest. 91 (94.79%) non-NCP patients were discharged from hospital, 4 (4.17%) were transferred to other hospitals for further treatment, and 1 (1.04%) died.The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20039065 doi: medRxiv preprint droplets or close contact. A recent study revealed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is 3.77, meaning that each infector could transmit the virus to another 3.77 people, which is higher than the R0 of SARS (2.0-3.0) [16] . As of Mar. 12 th of 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 125,048 patients have been confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 117 countries/regions [17] . Therefore, accurate identification and subsequent isolation of NCP patients plays a vital role in blocking the spread of the virus.Currently, the most commonly used golden standard for NCP diagnosis is a positive result of the real-time RT-PCR assay. However, Ai et al. reported that 3 suspected patients were negative in real-time RT-PCR assay and were later confirmed by metagenomics sequencing [9] . Wang et al. also reported that some patients were negative in the first three tests and turned to positive on the fourth test [18] . In this study, we confirmed 33 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from 129 suspected patients. 31(93.94%) of the patients were positive in the first RT-PCR test. Moreover, none of the patients who was negative in our first two tests were later diagnosed as NCP after discharge from hospital. The high positive rate of our assay might be due to the fact that we collected and detected both sputum and pharyngeal swab samples.Furthermore, we detected SARS-CoV-2 with two different kits simultaneously, and only if both results were negative was the patient excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection. If the results of the two reagents are not consistent, we will use another reagent for re-examination. These measures significantly improved the accuracy of our diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection and NCP.In our study, 13 RTPs detections were performed in 33 NCP patients ， and 2 (6.06%) patients were found to be co-infected with adenovirus or rhinovirus. Both of these two patients didn't develop into severe conditions, but recovered and were discharged 20 and 24 days after being treated with Coolidge plus Ribavirin. Our findings were consistent with a recent study which reported that none of 99 patients had co-infection of other respiratory viruses [4] . However, Ai et al. reported a high co-infection rate by using mNGS assay which found 5 out of 20 NCP patients co-infected with other viruses [9] ..

The most common pathogen was influenza (including influenza A and B), followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and metapneumovirus. Our findings were consistent with previous studies that reported the detection rate of pathogens in CAP adults as 30-40% [19] .Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently than bacteria. The most common pathogens in winter were human rhinovirus and influenza virus [19, 20] . In addition, about 70% of the 96 non-NCP patients in this study did not have any specific etiological diagnosis, which may be due to the specimens that we used for the detection being pharyngeal swabs but not alveolar lavage fluid. The positive rate of pharyngeal swab specimen in diagnosing CAP is usually low [20] . The SureX 13 respiratory pathogen multiplex kit used in this study did not include all common CAP pathogens such as Legionella and Chlamydia psittaci. It was reported that detection of alveolar lavage fluid with mNGS was able to detect more respiratory pathogens in CAP patients [21] .However, due to the difficulty in obtaining such samples and the high cost of the detection, mNGS was not used in this study.Previous studies reported that secondary bacterial infection commonly occurs in influenza infection and is associated with an increased risk of death [22, 23] . In 2009 pandemic influenza A cases, 18% to 34% of patients admitted to the ICU also had bacterial infection [22] . At present, there are few reports about the incidence of secondary bacterial or fungal infection in NCP patients during treatment. Chen et al. found that none of 99 patients had co-infection of other respiratory viruses, but 4 patients had co-infection of bacteria and fungi. Common pathogens included A baumannii, K pneumoniae, A flavus, C glabrata, and C albicans. The authors believed that the infection probably occurred secondary to severe ARDS and/or high dose or prolonged use of glucocorticoid therapy [4] . In another study, Ai et al. found 6 cases with bacterial and fungal infection among 20 NCP patients [9] . In our study, we did not find any NCP patients with secondary bacterial or fungal infection during treatment. Although 6 patients' G test results were above the normal reference value, they were all in severe condition and were given large amounts of albumin and gamma globulin which possibly affected the test results. Moreover, all of the fungal cultures were negative, and the patients did not receive any anti-fungal treatment but still recovered. We suspect that the reason for the low occurrence of secondary infection in our NCP patients is possibly due to the non-invasive regimens, such as maintaining the oxygen saturation through High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC), but not mechanical ventilation. The patients did not receive peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), either. Another possible reason is that glucocorticoid was very carefully used to treat the patients even in severe conditions. Our results suggest that the abuse of antimicrobial agents should be avoided in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2.Earlier studies on NCP patients in Wuhan reported high mortality as 11.1%-14.6% [1, 4] . However, recent studies based on large sample sizes with cases throughout China found a markedly lower case fatality rate (3.92%) [17] . In this study, the mortality of our 85 laboratory-confirmed NCP patients was only 1.18%. This finding is consistent with a most recent study, reporting the mortality of 1.4% of 1,099 cases [8] .In conclusion, in the present study, we found a certain proportion of infection and co-infection of other common pathogens of CAP during the NCP epidemic in Anhui province. This suggested that improvement of accuracy in microbiological laboratory detection is necessary to guide specific and precise treatment for the CAP patients. In this study, no secondary bacterial or fungal infection was detected in NCP patients during the treatment, suggesting that antibiotics should be used cautiously in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Please note that this is a single-center study with limited number of patients. The conclusions of this study need to be further verified by expanding the sample size.

Discussion

The SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus and is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus [4, 5] . The SARS-CoV, which caused an epidemic in 2002-2003, also belongs to this genus. Infection with these two viruses often leads to lower respiratory tract disease with poor clinical outcomes associated with old age and underlying health [15] , while SARS-CoV-2 seems to be more transmissible than SARS-CoV [7] . The virus is transmitted mainly through respiratory .

"Abstract

30 Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small, double-stranded DNA tumor viruses carried by diverse 31 vertebrates. PyVs have previously been considered highly host restricted in mammalian hosts, 32 with host-switching events thought rare or nonexistent. Prior investigations have revealed 33 short-range host-switching events of PyVs in two different African bat species within the 34 horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus. Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs 35 in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192 36 PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, 37 Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) representing 28 38 newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two 39 PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered 40 phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three 41 inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 42 the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with 43 the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously 44 explained by host-switching events. PyVs identified from geographically separated Chinese 45 horseshoe bat species in the present study showed close genetic identities, and clustered with 46 each other and with PyVs from African horseshoe bats, allowing assessment of the effects of 47 positive selection in VP1 within the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae. Correlation analysis 48 indicated that co-evolution with their hosts contributed much more to evolutionary divergence of 49 PyV than geographic distance. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence of .

In this 56 study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale 57 surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred 58 between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent 59 contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV 60 host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including 61 horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to 62 both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly 63 host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an 64 increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary 65 scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the 66 diverse PyVs in present day bats. This scheme provides a useful model to study the evolution of 67 PyVs in other hosts and, potentially, the modeling of bat zoonoses and the transmission of other 68 DNA viruses in other mammals, including humans.69 .

These diverse mammals harbor numerous highly virulent 73 viral pathogens, including rabies virus [2], Marburg virus [3], Ebola virus [4], Nipah virus [5], 74 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus [6-8] and the newly identified 75 swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus [9]. Spillover of viruses from bats to humans or 76 domestic animals can give rise to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases [10]. 77 Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are non-enveloped icosahedral DNA viruses containing a circular and 78highly stable double-stranded DNA genome [11, 12]. PyVs can induce neoplastic transformation 79 in cell culture [12], and are associated with malignancy in humans [13, 14] and raccoons [15]. 80 Currently, 98 species carried by various mammals, birds and fish are recognized within the 81 family Polyomaviridae by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and 82 classified into four separate genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-and Deltapolyomavirus) with nine 83 floating species [16]. Recent identification of diverse PyV-like sequences in different fish species 84 [17] and invertebrates (including arachnids and insects) has revealed a deep co-evolutionary 85 history of PyVs with their metazoan hosts [17]. PyVs are highly host-specific in different 86 mammalian species, and long-range host jumps leading to productive infection and transmission 87 within mammalian genera are considered rare or nonexistent [17, 18]. Recently, an intra-host 88 divergence model with contributions from viral lineage duplication, recombination and, 89 potentially, host-switching at evolutionary timescales has been proposed to explain the extant 90 diversity based on the available genetic data [17]. .

These studies identified significant diversity 94 and high positive rates (10-20 %) using PCR-based approaches [27]. PyVs with complete or 95 partial genomes has also been identified by metagenomic analyses in bats collected in China and 96 recently from Saudi Arabia [28-30]. Investigation of PyVs in African insectivorous and 97 frugivorous bats [25, 26] has revealed evidence for short-range host-switching events of PyVs in 98 horseshoe bats (family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) following identification of nearly 99 identical viruses (99.9% at the genomic level) in Rh. blasii and Rh. simulator [26]. 100 In the present study, we have characterized the diversity and genetic relationships of novel 101 PyVs from a large number of insectivorous and frugivorous bat samples collected in diverse 102 ecological environments in China, resulting in the identification of inter-family host-switching 103 events in these bat-borne PyVs. The findings challenge the prevailing paradigm of intra-host PyV 104 diversification in their mammalian hosts and extend the knowledge of PyV genetic diversity, 105 evolution, host restriction and host-switching.

VP1 genes of PyV were amplified using broad-spectrum primers from 186 positive samples and 151 then cloned into vectors. Four clones derived from each amplicon were sequenced to detect 152 potential co-infection of multiple PyVs in each positive sample. As a result, 180 of 186 bats were 153 confirmed to harbor one PyV, while the remaining 6 had a co-infection with two distinct PyVs 154 (detailed in S1 Table) . A total of 192 non-redundant partial VP1 sequences were obtained and 155 phylogenetically compared with VP1 sequences of known PyVs. Results showed that the 192 156 VP1 sequences had extensive diversity and could be classified into 44 clusters within the Alpha- 157 and Betapolyomavirus genera (Fig 2 and S1 Fig), 198 Among the newly identified single-host PyVs (Fig 3) , 19 PyVs shared 68-83% nt sequence 199 identities with the closest-known species or with each other in the LTAg coding sequences, Table) .

While mammalian PyVs are highly host specific [12] there are data suggesting cross-species 392 jumps of PyVs between closely related mammalian hosts. Previously, short-range intra-genus 393 host-switching events of PyVs were identified in African horseshoe bats, occurring between Rh. Another ICTV criterion is the allowable genetic distance of the LTAg coding sequence (≥ 449 15%) to demarcate PyV species. This cut-off value is not strict, as exemplified by two PyVs 450 identified in two different species of squirrel monkeys which shared 89% sequence identity but .

In addition to three bat inter-family host-switching events of PyVs, we also identified a partial 521 VP1 fragment in rectal tissue of a P. pipistrellus bat collected in northwestern Xinjiang that 522 showed 98% nt identity with the VP1 of a previously described Rattus norvegicus polyomavirus 523 1 identified in Germany [35] . Further qPCR assay also detected the virus in lung tissue of another 524 P. pipistrellus bat but not from any brown rat (n=51) collected in the same Xinjiang area. This 525 preliminary observation provides an impetus to investigate potential PyV host-switching between 526 mammal species beyond families.

The host-switching events identified in this study were strongly associated with the ecological 528 environment of the hosts, with host-switching only identified between different bat species in one 529 to two colonies.

An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV / SARS-

","Introduction

2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV / SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China since December 2019. 1, 2 World Health Organization (WHO) now has named the disease COVID-19, short for ""coronavirus disease 2019"". 3 Most cases from the initial cluster had an epidemiological link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. 4 Patients have clinical manifestations including fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, confusion, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, diarrhoea, and nausea and vomiting. 5, 6 As of 17 February 2020, a cumulative total of 72,436 confirmed cases (including 11,741 currently severe cases), 6,242 currently suspect cases, a cumulative total of 1,868 deaths and 12,552 cases discharged from hospital were reported by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC) in mainland China. 7 The significant increases in the number of confirmed cases in China and abroad led to the announcement made by WHO on 30 January that the event has already constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 8 The reproduction number, R, measures the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by each infected person, the initial constant of which is called the basic reproduction number, R0, 9 and the actual average number of secondary cases per infected case at time t is called effective reproduction number, Rt. [10] [11] [12] Rt shows timedependent variation with the implementation of control measures. R >1 indicates that the outbreak is self-sustaining unless effective control measures are implemented, while R <1indicates that the number of new cases decreases over time and, eventually, the outbreak will stop. 9 Over the past month, several groups reported estimated R0 of COVID-19 and generated All rights reserved.

In particular, Imai et al. 9 provided the first estimation, using R0 of 2.6 and based on the number of cases in China and those detected in other countries. Other authors estimated R0 to be 3.8, 13 6 .47, 14 2.2, 15 and 2.68. 16 These predictions were very alerting and suggestions have been made for very strict public health measures to contain the epidemics.In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, a series of prompt public health measures have been taken. On 1 January, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was closed in the hope of eliminating zoonotic source of the virus. 5 On 11 January, upon isolation of the viral strain for COVID-19 and establishment of its whole genome sequences, 17 RT-PCR reagents were developed and provided to Wuhan, which ensured the fast ascertainment of infection. 15 On 21 January, Emergency Response System was activated to better provide ongoing support to the COVID-19 response. 18 Ever since the outbreak, the work of intensive surveillance, epidemiological investigations and isolation of suspect cases gradually improved. Those having had close contacts with infections were asked to receive medical observation and quarantine for 14 days. 19 Travel from and to Wuhan City as well as other medium-sized cities in Hubei Province has been restricted since 23 January 2020. 20The 2019-nCoV / SARS-CoV-2 has at least 79.5% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV. 5, 17 Riley estimated that 2.7 secondary infections were generated per case on average (R0 = 2.7) at the start of the SARS epidemic without controlling. 21 After isolating the patients and controlling the infection by the authority, the value of Rt for SARS decreased to 0.25. 22 As Li et al. mentioned, it is possible that subsequent control measures in Wuhan, and elsewhere in mainland China, have reduced transmissibility. 15 A new estimation of the epidemic dynamics All rights reserved.

We hope to depict two types of epidemic dynamics to provide potential evaluation standard for the effects of current prevention and control measures, and to provide theoretical basis for future prevention decisions of the current epidemic in China.

Estimation of the epidemic trend assuming that the prevention and control measures are insufficient in Wuhan, China

Assuming the epidemic continues to develop with R0 = 1.9, 2.6 and 3.1 9 from 1 December 2019, the number of infections will continue to rise (Fig. 1) . By the end of February 2020, COVID-19 cases would be 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989 in Wuhan, China with R0 = 1.9, 2.6 and 3.1, respectively.

As a result, since 24 January 2020, all public transports from and to Wuhan, as well as public transports and people's gathering events within Wuhan, were stopped.Since 2 February 2020, strict public health measures were taken to prevent population flow among distinct communities whereas since 9 February 2020, public health interventions including quarantine of each building in the urban area and each village in the rural area were implemented in order to block the transmission chain among the household.

With more precise parameters obtained as the epidemic progresses, our estimation model will also be more precise. Our estimates of the reproductive number from 3.1 to 0.5 are based on previous studies and experience from SARS control. However, this measure may change substantially over the course of this epidemic and as additional data arrives. Besides, using a fixed Rt value in each phase may incur potential bias because Rt is essentially a dynamic parameter. Thirdly, these estimated data may not be sustained if unforeseeable factors occurred. For example, if some infections were caused by multiple exposures to animals, these estimates will be exposed to a big uncertainty. Fourthly, the epidemic trend shows great difference between Wuhan and Hubei Despite the limitations mentioned above, the current study is the first to provide estimation for epidemic trend after strict prevention and control measures were implemented in China.Whether current prevention and control measures are sufficient or not may be evaluated through the occurrence of the infection number peak in February.

Model

We employed an infectious disease dynamics model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed model; SEIR model) for the purpose of modeling and predicting the number of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China. The model is a classic epidemic method to analyze the infectious disease which has a definite latent period, and has proved to be predictive for a variety of acute infectious diseases in the past such as Ebola and SARS. 22, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Application of the mathematical model is of great guiding significance to assess the impact of isolation of symptomatic cases as well as observation of asymptomatic contact cases and to promote evidence-based decisions and policy.We assumed no new transmissions from animals, no differences in individual immunity, the time-scale of the epidemic is much faster than characteristic times for demographic processes (natural birth and death), and no differences in natural births and deaths. In this model, individuals are classified into four types: susceptible (S; at risk of contracting the disease), exposed (E; infected but not yet infectious), infectious (I; capable of transmitting the disease), and removed (R; those who recover or die from the disease). The total population size (N) is given by N = S+E+I+R. It is assumed that susceptible individuals who have been infected first enter a latent (exposed) stage, during which they may have a low level of infectivity. The differential equations of the SEIR model are given as: 32, 33 All rights reserved.

R software (Version 3.6.2) was applied for all the calculations and estimates in the current study.

Estimation of the epidemic trend assuming the prevention and control measures are insufficient

We first estimated the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China assuming the current prevention and control measures are insufficient. In this process, S was assumed to be the population of Wuhan City (11 million). 15, 34 The initial assumed number of cases caused by zoonotic exposure was 40 (I) according to Imai et al.'s estimation. 9 We proposed E at 20 times of I in accordance with Read et al. 13 R was set as 0. σ was set as 1/5.2 according to the latest article by Li et at. 15 the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is Chinese authorities mobilized more medical resources to support Wuhan ever since. 36 The newly constructed hospital ""Huoshenshan"" come into service on this day 37 and ""Leishenshan""， mobile cabin hospitals several days later. 38 And also, more and more medical teams arrived in Wuhan. So the third phase began on 3 February and Rt was set as 1.9 consistent with Imai et al.'s estimation of low transmission level. 9 All of these measures may need one longest incubation period to take effect.

Results 125

RNase L antiviral activity inhibits DENV and WNV production but not ZIKV production. 126We have previously shown that ZIKV activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway can be 127 detected by 24hpi (Whelan et al., 2019) . Using host 28S and 18S rRNA degradation as a 128 measurement for RNase L activation, we show that RNase L activation during ZIKV 129 infection is mediated by the OAS3 isoform specifically ( Figure 1A , left panel). By 48hpi, 130 degradation of rRNA was detected in ZIKV-infected OAS1 KO and OAS2 KO cells similar 131 to that of parental WT cells, while KO of OAS3 or RNase L prevented as well as confirmed 132RNase L-mediated cleavage of rRNA ( Figure 1B) . In contrast to other RNase L-activating 133 viruses, RNase L nuclease activity did not restrict ZIKV production. This was 134 demonstrated by a lack viral titer increase by 48hpi, after multiple rounds of replication, 135 in ZIKV-infected RNase L KO cells compared to in WT cells ( Figure 1C) . Instead, deletion 136 of RNase L reduced ZIKV production. In comparison to ZIKV, we detected weaker 137 activation of RNase L by West Nile virus Kunjin strain (KUNV), although also OAS3-138 All rights reserved.

Despite reduced RNase L activation by DENV and KUNV, both viruses were 140 restricted by RNase L activity in WT cells ( Figure 1C) . Therefore, RNase L is not only 141 ineffective in inhibiting ZIKV infection, but also specifically promotes ZIKV production 142 ( Figure 1A, right panel) . 143 144 RNase L improves ZIKV RF function to increase ZIKV RNA and protein expression. 145Since infectious virus production was enhanced by RNase L expression, we examined 146 whether RNase L was required for optimal ZIKV replication. We used 147 immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) for detection of the replication intermediate dsRNA 148and the ZIKV NS3 protein as markers for ZIKV RFs, comparing expression levels in WT 149and RNase L KO cells. At 20hpi, expression of both ZIKV dsRNA and NS3 was increased 150 in WT cells, as measured by mean dsRNA and NS3 intensity at perinuclear ER sites 151 characteristic of flaviviruses ( Figure 2AB&C) . We also observed a change in localization 152 of ZIKV dsRNA and NS3 in RNase L KO cells, both of which were more disseminated 153 around the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. We used circularity and diameter parameters 154 to quantify the spread of viral products throughout the cell at 20hpi, and determined that 155RNase L deletion decreased circularity and increased diameter of RFs, distinct from the 156 densely concentrated RF phenotype observed in WT cells ( Figure 2AB&C) . We 157 observed this trend of viral RF diffusion in RNase L KO cells as early as 16hpi through 158 30hpi, in two different RNase L KO clones ( Figure S1 ).

Additionally, since alterations in ZIKV dsRNA and NS3 were nearly 162 identical, we proceeded to measure effects on RFs using dsRNA expression only. 163When comparing DENV dsRNA expression and localization in RNase L KO cells 164to that of WT cells, we found that dsRNA intensity and circularity were decreased while 165 diameter was increased without RNase L, a similar trend but to a lesser degree than with 166 ZIKV ( Figure 2D&F) . Furthermore, this does not result in a defect in virus release as 167 measured by viral titer, but instead virus titer is enhanced by RNase L KO (Figure 1C The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. We also found that by 48hpi OAS3 KO, which suppresses RNase L activation, 201 restored infectious ZIKV production from reduced levels of RNase L KO cells to that 202 observed during WT cell infection ( Figure 3D ). DENV production, which was limited by 203RNase L in WT cells, was not improved by OAS3 KO, suggesting an OAS3-independent 204RNase L-mediated inhibition of DENV infection ( Figure 3D ). While KUNV production was 205 also limited by RNase L in WT cells, it improved with OAS3 KO as observed with ZIKV. 206However, unlike DENV, KUNV activation of RNase L was OAS3-dependent ( Figure 1B) . 207 All rights reserved.

These results from cells lacking OAS3 209 suggest that ZIKV infection may utilize an inactive form of RNase L in a unique manner 210 that results in higher virus production than with RNase L absent. revealed that deletion of RNase L did not alter intensity of genome expression when 230 All rights reserved.

Since genome staining was not circular in shape, we instead used 231 total area to measure increased dissemination of genome throughout the infected cell in RNase L KO cells, but not increased over that in WT cells as was observed for ZIKV 250 ( Figure 4F ). Since KUNV does not activate RNase L until 48hpi by rRNA degradation 251 assay ( Figure 1B ), we had not expected a change in genome intensity between cell lines 252 at 20hpi.

Overall, absence of OAS3-dependent RNase L activity had a 255 greater impact on ZIKV genome localization and expression compared to that of DENV 256 and KUNV, which agrees with its minimal effects on DENV and KUNV RFs and viral titers.

In RNase L KO cells, dsRNA was detectable, validating that absence of 277 dsRNA in WT cells was due to RNase L specifically and not from other antiviral responses 278 induced by pIC ( Figure 5B ). In OAS3 KO cells, pIC transfection before ZIKV infection 279 had no effect on dsRNA expression, further demonstrating that RNase L was not 280 activated in the absence of OAS3 (Figure 5C) . 281To corroborate these results with a more quantitative method, we also used this Figure 5D ). Finally, these results suggest that inactive RNase L retains 297 ZIKV genome in smaller, more efficient RFs. 298 299 All rights reserved.

This provided an RNase L-308 deficient cell line as a control for this system, in addition to verification that effects in RL 309 R667A-expressing cells were not possibly due to endogenous RNase L WT expression. 310While RL WT protein expression was lower than that of RL R667A, it was sufficient for 311RNase L-mediated rRNA degradation, which was only detectable in ZIKV infected +RL 312 WT cells and not VC or +RL R667A cells, despite OAS3 protein expression in all three 313 cell lines (Figure 6A&B) . We evaluated effects of RNase L WT or R667A expression on 314 ZIKV dsRNA expression and localization compared to that of VC cells at 20hpi, using PDI 315 ER staining to denote RF sites. We found that expression of either RL WT or RL R667A 316 increased ZIKV dsRNA intensity at the ER over that in VC cells, however only RL R667A 317 increased circularity of ZIKV RFs in comparison to those of VC cells (Figure 6C&D) . To 318 determine if RNase L effects on ZIKV dsRNA intensity or circularity correlated with 319 elevated infectious ZIKV titers, we measured virus from infected HeLa M cells at 48hpi 320 and detected a significant increase in ZIKV production in RL R667A-expressing cells 321 compared to VC or RL WT-expressing cells (Figure 6E ).

Paclitaxel in WT cells reduced infectious ZIKV titers to the level of RNase L KO cells 369

( Figure 7F) . Moreover, paclitaxel did not reduce ZIKV titers in RNase L KO cells, 370suggesting that the paclitaxel means of blocking ZIKV production was lost in RNase L KO 371 cells where microtubule associations with ZIKV RFs were already weak due to absence 372 of RNase L (Figure 7F) . Together with the effects of paclitaxel on dsRNA expression, 373 these results offer a mechanism for RNase L-mediated increased ZIKV production 374 through ZIKV employment of RNase L-cytoskeleton interactions during formation of RFs. 375 376

Discussion 377

In this study, we present findings supporting a proviral role of the host RNase L protein, 378 which has otherwise been considered strictly antiviral. RNase L nucleolytic activity is 379 highly effective at restricting replication of a diverse range of DNA and RNA viruses 380 (Silverman, 2007) . However, catalytic activation of RNase L by ZIKV does not limit 381 infection, and instead ZIKV titers are paradoxically increased with RNase L expression. 382In particular, a catalytically inactive form of RNase L improved ZIKV RF assembly and 383 function, thereby boosting virus production. We also provide evidence suggesting that 384 ZIKV repurposes the interaction between RNase L and the cytoskeleton to facilitate 385 rearrangement of the ER for establishment of ZIKV RFs. While cytoskeletal arrangements 386 for RF assembly within ER folds are characteristic of flaviviruses, we found that RNase L 387 expression during DENV and KUNV infection had only minimal effects on RF formation. 388Furthermore, RNase L was ultimately restrictive of both viruses, operating in its canonical 389 antiviral manner to decrease DENV and KUNV titers through its catalytic activity. 390 All rights reserved.

"Abstract

Objective: To investigate the correlation between clinical characteristics and cardiac injury of COVID-2019 pneumonia.

","

observed [1] . Researchers reported that about 12% COVID-19 patients suffered acute cardiac injury [2] . Patients with cardiac disease have a higher fatality rate. However, the alerting clinical parameters of cardiac injury after COVID-19 infection and the correlation between cardiac injury and the COVID-19 severity remains to be determined. In this retrospective, single-center study, we recruited 41 consecutive cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to Beijing Youan Hospital, China from Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020. We selected the indicators, including heart rate (HR), Troponin I (TnI) and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) observed on chest computed tomographic (CT) scan, that is high related to cardiac injury. Tachycardia, TnI elevation and a trend of lower threshold attenuation EAT density in CT scan have been observed in severe and critical patients. Our results suggested that main attentions should be paid on monitoring the high risk factors of arrhythmia and cardiac function, including HR, TnI, and radiographic feature, that is, EAT density, to protect the COVID-19 patients from cardiac injury.

Data collection

We retrospectively collected the medical records, including epidemiology, clinical, complications, laboratory findings, chest CT scans, therapy procedure and outcome data, of 41 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 17, 2020. All data were checked by two trained physicians. All patients, in this study, were diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases according to the 6 th edition guideline issued by China's National Health Commission. This study is in compliance with the Institutional Review Board of Beijing Youan Hospital, China.

Chest CT image acquisition and analysis

All CT images of 41 patients were retrospectively collected. The in-plane size of CT image was 512*512 pixels, and the slice thickness was 0.9 mm. We measured EAT in a range between the bifurcation of pulmonary artery and diaphragm according to the lung CT scan. EAT density was recorded in mean attenuation Hounsfield units (HU).

According to the size of the heart, we manually depicted the area of intra pericardium on each thin CT image slice. Seven to ten parallel and equidistant axial contour of pericardium were selected by trained cardiologists.

Statistical analysis

We present continuous measurements as mean±SD if they are normally distributed or median (IQR) if they are not. For continuous variables, comparisons between groups were performed using Kruskal-Wallis test according to the data of normal or nonnormal distribution and equal variance, respectively. Categorical data were presented as counts (proportions) and were compared using either a χ2 test or Fisher exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test according to the data. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 19; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

Results

A total of 41 patients were enrolled, including 19 (46.3%) males and 22 (53.6%) females. 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, respectively. The median age was 47 years (35.5-64, range between 15-89 years). 18 patients have been discharged, 21 patients are still in hospital and 2 patients died (their ages were 82 and 65). Old adult male patients are more prone to be in severe conditions (P<0.01). The level of lymphocyte percentage of the severe and critical patients was lower than those of light and mild patients. We found that the level of TnI, one of the cardiac biomarkers, is remarkably higher in critical group (P<0.01) than in other groups, indicative of high risk of cardiac injury. The high level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in critical group (P<0.01) indicated that the occurring of acute inflammation. Note that, the renal and hepatic function biomarkers, creatinine (CRE), alanine aminotransferase (AST) and Aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), were statistically significant (P<0.05). Clinical features and laboratory findings were summarized in Table 1 . All these data indicated that COVID-19 could cause multiple organic injury. All rights reserved.

Cardiac-related chronic diseases in COVID-19 patients

Among the 41 patients, 10 patients have underlying complications, as shown in patients.

Troponin I elevation in severe and critical patients

We collected TnI data from 20 patients. The elevation of TnI elevation was found in 4 patients, the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027052 doi: medRxiv preprint to the small population of the enrolled patients. 

Tachycardia in severe and critical patients

The heart rates (HR) was documented in 17 patients, and tachycardia was found in 3 patients, of which 1 (1/3) in severe group and 2 (2/3) in critical group (Figure 3 ). The differences of HRs between the critical and the mild (P<0.01) or light group (P<0.01) were statistically significant. The differences of heart rates between the severe and the mild (P<0.01) or light group (P<0.01) were also statistically significant. No significant difference of HR has been found between the severe group and the critical group (P>0.05). As fever itself leads to tachycardia, we analyzed the body temperatures (BT) of different groups. No significant difference of BT has been found between the sever and the mild (P>0.05) or the light(P>0.05) group. There is no significant difference of BT between the mild and the critical group(P>0.05).The rising of HR in COVID-19 patients, which is disproportionate with the increase of the BT.It attracts our attention of tachycardia in the severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Since hypoxia is also a risk factor of elevation of HR, we also analyzed the SpO2 in different groups.We found that SpO2 is lower in the severe (P<0.01) and critical group(P<0.01), compared with the mild group. Patients in severe and critical groups need more intense oxygen support, and 2 patients in the critical group have invasive mechanical ventilation. However, no significant difference of SpO2 has been observed between the severe and the critical group (P>0.05). This All rights reserved.

More importantly, 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 123 bpm and 160 bpm respectively. One 82 years old male patient has persistent atrial fibrillation before the infection of COVID-19. Another 65 years old male patient, has not been diagnosed to have atrial fibrillation or other cardiac problems before. Both patients ended up with death. It should be noted that we have to pay great attention on the tachycardia in the severe and critical COVID-19 patients. 

Low EAT density in CT scans for severe and critical patients

We found that the mean EAT density were -98.77 HU and -96.08 HU in the critical (44-year male) and severe (65-year male) groups, respectively ( Figure   4c-d) , which was lower than patients in the light (-69.37 HU, 44-year female) and mild (-84.76 HU, 37-year male) groups (Figure 4a-b) . Patients from severe and critical group had a smaller value than the heathy heart (mean CT value in the range of -70 ~ -80 HU, p<0.05) [4] . The results indicated that cardiac inflammation may occur in COVID-19 patients. 

Discussion

In this retrospective, single-center study, we investigated the high risk factors, including TnI All rights reserved.

Our results suggested the occurrence of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. TnI has been widely used as one of the key biomarkers in cardiac injury [2] . In our study, all 3 patients in the critical group and 1 patient in the severe group showed the rising level of TnI. However, patients in light or mild group have no significant TnI elevation. Thus, TnI may be served as severity indicator of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patient. In terms of tachycardia, 2 of 3 patients with Tachycardia had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and their peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. However, it is not the case in light and mild group. Compared to another coronavirus, SARS in 2003, tachycardia has also been noticed in patients with SARS [5] . Even in recovery phase the rest HR in SARS patients exceeded 90 bpm, and 72.1% patients have HR above 100 bmp after mild exercises. In our study, the elevation of HR is disproportionate with the increase of the body temperature, however, is related with lower SPO2. Higher HR is most likely resulting in worsen prognosis, and tachycardia should be paid extra attention to COVID-19 patients. It is suggested that electrocardiogram (ECG) should also be monitored to specify the classification of tachycardia in the future study.The analysis of COVID-19 patients with cardiac-related chronic diseases (coronary artery disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus) showed that they were more prone to be in the severe or critical conditions. The ALT, AST, and CRE elevation could also be observed in severe and critical group, indicative of multiple organic injury. These findings were consistent with previous studies that COVID-19 caused multiple organic dysfunction and poor prognosis in patients with complications [1] . In a previous study of 1700 SARS patients, the presence of diabetes mellitus and/or cardiac diseases was related both to a higher mortality rate and an adverse outcome [5] . Diabetes mellitus; heart disease; and chronic lung disease were reported more frequently among MERS case-patients than among healthy controls [6, 7] . Patients with cardiac-related chronic diseases should get more intense clinical care in COVID-19 and other coronavirus infected diseases.Recently, a pathological study of COVID-19 showed that few monocyte cells were found in myocardial interstitial, however, no inflammation cells were observed in myocardial tissue [8] .All rights reserved.

Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα than those non-ICU admission [2] . These previous researches supported that the cytokine storm, not be induced by direct virus infection, but was associated with cardiac inflammation in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the rising level of CRP in COVID-19 patients also indicated the occurrence of inflammation in the circulation. In another aspect, EAT, defined as fat within the pericardial sac, has increased inflammatory cytokine expression in patients with CAD at the tissue level [4, 9] . Thus, to further understand the inflammatory in COVID-19 patients, we quantified EAT density in CT scans, in which the lower CT threshold attenuation value considered as the indicator of inflammation [4] . We found that the mean CT threshold attenuation value of EAT in the critical, severe and mild group, were lower than patients in the light group. Patients from severe and critical group had a lower CT threshold attenuation value than the reported heathy heart. This results suggested that lower EAT density showed the cardiac inflammation in COVID-19 patients.This study has several limitations. First, only 41 confirmed COVID-19 patients from single center were included. It would be better to include as many patients as possible, even from multicenter, to get a more comprehensive understanding of cardiac injury of COVID-19.Second, more detailed heart function-related data, particularly including ECG or echocardiography, was unavailable at this time. Nonetheless, the data presented in this study allow an early assessment of the clinical characteristics of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients.Finally, chest CT data of the patients in health was unobtainable to determinate the changes of heart functions with and without COVID-19 infection. In future study, the follow-up chest CT scan during hospitalization could be collected to quantify the change of EAT density in CT scans.In conclusion, this retrospective, single-center study of 41 confirmed COVID-19 patients has showed the correlation between clinical characteristics and cardiac injury of COVID-19. The high risk factors of cardiac injury including tachycardia, TnI elevation and low EAT density in CT scan, have been observed in the severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Our results suggested that the more attentions shall be applied to protect heart functions, particularly for All rights reserved.

"Abstract

Coronaviruses (CoVs) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease 28 outbreaks, most recently exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we 29show that the ribonucleoside analog β-D-N 4 -hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) has 30 broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV 2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and 31 .

","Introduction 44

The genetically diverse Orthocoronavirinae (coronavirus, CoV) family circulates 45 in many avian and mammalian species. Phylogenetically, CoVs are divided into 4 46 genera: alpha (group 1), beta (group 2), gamma (group 3) and delta (group 4). Three 47 to determine if NHC would increase the mutation frequency during MERS-CoV infection 156 in human primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE). Using MERS-CoV infected HAE 157 treated with either vehicle or a dose range of NHC or RDV, we show that both drugs 158 reduced virus titers in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) . We then employed a highly-159 sensitive high-fidelity deep sequencing approach (Primer ID NGS), which uses 160 barcoded degenerate primers and Illumina indexed libraries to determine accurate 161 mutation rates after antiviral treatment on viral RNA production 25 . Using this approach, 162 we analyzed a 538bp region of viral genomic RNA in nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15). 163The error rates (#mutations/10,000 bases) in vehicle (0.01) or RDV (0.01) treated 164 cultures were very low. RDV is reported to act via chain termination of nascent viral 165 RNA, and thus the low error rates in RDV-treated cultures are in line with the proposed 166 MOA 26 . In contrast, the error rate was significantly increased in NHC-treated CoV RNA in a dose-dependent manner (10-fold at 10µM and 5-fold at 1µM) at both 24 168 and 48hpi (Fig. 4C ). The magnitude of the error rate in NHC-treated cultures correlated 169 with virus titer reduction. At 48hpi the respective error rate and virus titer was 0.015 and 170 3.96E+06 pfu/mL for vehicle treatment, 0.045 and 2.86E+04 pfu/mL with 1µM NHC; and 171 0.090 and 1.5E+02 pfu/mL 10µM NHC. Thus, with 1µM NHC a 3-fold increase in error 172 rate resulted in a 138-fold decrease in virus titer, while with 10µM NHC a 6-fold increase 173 in error rate resulted in a 26,000-fold decrease in virus titer. 174We then examined the mutational spectra induced by NHC, which can be 175 incorporated into viral RNA as a substitution for either cytosine (C) or Uridine (U). RNA-176 mutagenic antivirals may incorporate in both nascent negative and positive sense RNA 177 during genome replication (Fig. 4D) . Adenine-to-guanine (A-to-G) and uracil-to-cytosine 178 (U-to-C) transitions were enriched in MERS-CoV genomic RNA in an NHC dose-179 dependent manner (Fig. 4E) . Collectively, these data used high-fidelity sequence 180 analysis to demonstrate a specific enrichment for A:G and C:U transitions in CoV RNA after NHC treatment of primary HAE cell cultures. 182 183 Therapeutic EIDD-2801 reduces SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis. 184 hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester), designed for improved in vivo pharmacokinetics and 187 oral bioavailability in humans and non-human primates 12 . Importantly, the plasma 188 profiles of NHC and EIDD-2801 were similar in mice following oral delivery 12 . We first 189 performed a prophylactic dose escalation study in C57BL/6 mice where we orally 190 administered vehicle (10% PEG, 2.5% Cremophor RH40 in water) or 50, 150 or 500 191 mg/kg EIDD-2801 2hr prior to intranasal infection with 5E+04 PFU of mouse-adapted 192 SARS-CoV (SARS-MA15), and then every 12hr thereafter. Beginning on 3dpi and 193 through the end of the study, body weight loss compared to vehicle treatment was 194 significantly diminished (50mg/kg) or prevented (150, 500mg/kg) with EIDD-2801 195 prophylaxis (P < 0.0001) (Supplemental Figure 2A) . Lung hemorrhage was also 196 significantly reduced 5dpi with 500mg/kg EIDD-2801 treatment (Supplemental Figure  197 2B). Interestingly, there was a dose-dependent reduction in SARS-CoV lung titer 198 (median titers: 50mg/kg = 7E+03 pfu/mL, 150mg/kg = 2.5E+03 pfu/mL, 500mg/kg = 50 199 pfu/mL, vehicle = 6.5E+04 pfu/mL) with significant differences among the vehicle, 150 200 mg/kg (P = 0.03) and 500mg/kg (P = 0.006) groups. Thus, prophylactic orally 201 administered EIDD-2801 was robustly antiviral and able to prevent SARS-CoV 202 replication and disease. 203Since only the 500mg/kg group significantly diminished weight loss, hemorrhage 204 and reduced lung titer to near undetectable levels, we tested this dose under 205 therapeutic treatment conditions to determine if EIDD-2801 could improve the outcomes 206 of an ongoing CoV infection. As a control, we initiated oral vehicle or EIDD-2801 2hr 207 prior to infection with 1E+04 pfu SARS-MA15. For therapeutic conditions, we initiated 208 EIDD-2801 treatment 12, 24, or 48hr after infection. After initiating treatment, dosing for 209 all groups was performed every 12hr for the duration of the study. Both prophylactic 210 treatment initiated 2hr prior to infection and therapeutic treatment initiated 12hr after 211 infection significantly prevented body weight loss following SARS-CoV infection on 2dpi 212 and thereafter (-2hr: P = 0.0002 to <0.0001; +12hr: P = 0.0289 to <0.0001) (Fig. 5A) . 213Treatment initiated 24hpi also significantly reduced body weight loss (3-5dpi, P = 0.01 to 214 <0.0001) although not to the same degree as the earlier treatment initiation groups. 215When initiated 48hpi, body weight loss was only different from vehicle on 4dpi (P = 216 initiated up to 24hr after infection mirroring the body weight loss phenotypes (Fig. 5B) . 218Interestingly, all EIDD-2801 treated mice had significantly reduced viral loads in the 219 lungs even in the +48hr group (Fig. 5C) , which experienced the least protection from 220 body weight loss and lung hemorrhage. We also measured pulmonary function via 221 whole body plethysmography (WPB). In Figure 5D , we show the WBP PenH metric, 222 which is a surrogate marker for bronchoconstriction or pulmonary obstruction 27 , was 223 significantly improved throughout the course of the study if treatment was initiated up to 224 12hr after infection, although the +24hr group showed sporadic improvement as well 225 (Fig. 5D ). Lastly, we blindly evaluated hematoxylin and eosin stained lung tissue 226 sections for histological features of ALI using two different and complementary scoring 227 tools 15 , which show that treatment initiated up to +12hr significantly reduced ALI ( We then evaluated the therapeutic efficacy EIDD-2801 following the promising 245 results of our prophylactic studies. Similar to our SARS-CoV study, EIDD-2801 246 treatment administered before or 12hr after intranasal mouse-adapted MERS-CoV 247 infection (5E+04 PFU) prevented body weight loss from 2 through 6dpi ( Fig. 6A , P = 248 0.02 to <0.0001) and lung hemorrhage on 6dpi (Fig. 6B , P = 0.0004 to < 0.0001), but 249 treatment initiated 24 or 48hr did not offer similar protection. Unlike body weight loss 250 and lung hemorrhage data which varied by treatment initiation time, virus lung titer on 251 6dpi was significantly reduced to the limit of detection in all treatment groups (Fig. 6C , P 252 < 0.0001). Interestingly, when viral genomic RNA was quantified in paired samples of 253 lung tissue, EIDD-2801 significantly reduced levels of viral RNA (P <0.0001 to 0.017) in 254 an initiation time-dependent manner for all groups except for +48hr (Fig. 6D) To study the molecular mechanisms associated with drug performance in vivo, 267 we investigated the correlation between infectious virus production and EIDD-2801-268 mediated mutagenesis of MERS-CoV RNA under therapeutic treatment conditions. 269Using Primer ID NGS, we measured the mutation rates of both viral genomic RNA (i.e. indicating that neither vehicle nor drug treatment significantly affected the levels of or 278 mutated ISG15 mRNA transcripts (Fig. 6G ).

In addition, nucleotide transitions 284 observed in MERS-CoV genomes in vitro (i.e. C to U transitions, Fig. 3 ), were also 285 observed in vivo in groups where treatment was initiated prior to and up to 12hr post 286 infection (P = 0.0003 to < 0.0001) (Fig. 5I) . Importantly, these transitions were not 287 observed in host ISG15 mRNA (Fig. 5I) compressed as compared to that in humans. While SARS-and MERS-CoV lung titers 325 peak on 2dpi in mice concurrent with the onset of clinical signs and notable damage to 326 the lung epithelium, in humans this occurs 7-10 days after the onset of 327 symptoms 16,28,36,37 . Thus, in mice, the window within which to treat emerging CoV 328 infection prior to peak replication is compressed (e.g., 24-48hr) but should be much 329 longer in humans. Although speculative, the SARS-and MERS-CoV in vivo data 330 provided herein suggest that 2019-nCoV will prove highly vulnerable to NHC treatment 331 modalities in vivo, critical experiments that must be performed as animal models 332 become available. The data provided in this manuscript suggest that NHC should be 333 quickly evaluated in primate models of human disease, using immediate models for 334 MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pathogenesis 38,39 . 335Small molecule antivirals can exert their antiviral effect through multiple 336 mechanisms including blocking viral entry, inhibiting a virally encoded enzyme, blocking 337 virus particle formation, or targeting a host factor required for replication 40 .

Therefore, the NHC MOA would appear less likely to be affected by the RNA 343 proofreading activity encoded by the nsp14 exonuclease function that otherwise limits 344 misincorperation 41 . Here, we present data using Primer ID NGS, a state of the art deep 345 sequencing-based approach, to quantitate the frequency and identity of the mutational 346 spectra in the MERS-CoV genome in both drug treated primary human airway cells and 347 in mice at single genome resolution 25 . As CoV are positive sense RNA viruses that 348 replicate through a negative sense RNA intermediate, NHC incorporation as a ""C"" or a 349 ""U"" can occur in both polarities of RNA. Using Primer ID NGS, we found increased 350 nucleotide transitions (A to G, G to A, C to U, U to C) consistent with those reported 351 after influenza and VEE infections 11,12 . Under identical conditions, remdesivir did not 352 alter the mutation rate in MERS-CoV genomic RNA, supporting its reported mechanism 353 of action as a chain terminator of viral RNA synthesis 26 . In primary human lung cell 354 cultures and mice infected with MERS-CoV, the NHC mutation rates inversely 355 correlated with a reduction in infectious virus. In addition, we found a positive correlation 356 between increased mutation rates and the frequency of nonsynonymous mutations and 357 the degree of therapeutic efficacy in mice. To explore the potential off-target effect in 358 host mRNA which may contribute to drug toxicity, we also examined the impact of NHC 359 treatment on transcripts from the highly MERS-CoV induced interferon stimulated gene 360 15 (ISG15). While ISG15 is present in great abundance, an accumulation of mutations 361 was not observed in ISG15 in this model even at 500mg/kg dosing. These data also 362 support previous studies using RNAseq to demonstrate that the model coronavirus 363 MHV displayed increased mutation frequencies following NHC treatment in vitro 13 .

Cell death factor expression in HAE 

"
"Abstract

In this work we propose a data-driven age-structured census-based SIRD-like epidemiological model capable of forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil. We model the current scenario of closed schools and universities, social distancing of people above sixty years old and voluntary home quarantine to show that it is still not enough to protect the health system by explicitly computing the demand for hospital intensive care units. We also show that an urgent intense quarantine might be the only solution to avoid the collapse of the health system and, consequently, to minimize the quantity of deaths. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the relaxation of the already imposed control measures in the next days would be catastrophic..

","I. INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) is a main threat for the public health systems throughout the globe [1 -12] . As of April 03, 2020, the world had more than one million (1.016.401) confirmed cases, 53.160 deaths and 211.775 recovered persons [7] since the first suspected case of (COVID-19) on December, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [8] , with a frightening propagation speed. So far, 52 countries reported more than 1000 cases from all continents, Antarctica being the only exception with no cases. In Brazil, at the time of writing, the COVID-19 statistics was: 8.066 confirmed cases, 327 deaths and 127 recovered individuals [7] . Therefore, a critical aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than the percentage of infection and even the mortality rate, is the healthcare system capacity. In Brazil, the number of intensive care units (ICUs) up to February 2020 was 36, 939 adult and pediatric beds according to the Cadastro Nacional de Estabelecimentos de Saúde (CNES) available in the DataSUS portal in Ref. [13] (in Portuguese, please see instructions to retrieve the data), with a historical occupancy of not less than 85%, which yields in about 5500 free ICUs [14] . In fact, the report by the Health's National Agency set an ideal occupation target of 80% to 85%, therefore our estimation can be in fact an upper bound. The average number of ICUs per 100.000 inhabitants is around a ten [15] , US leading the world with a ratio of 34.7 [16] , much below what is expected to be needed as the number of infections approaches its peak. Therefore, no country is really pre- * askery.canabarro@arapiraca.ufal.br pared for a devastating amount of critical patients. To cope with that and in order to protect the healthcare systems, in the absence of any efficient medicament and/or vaccine to pharmaceutically detain the fast spread of the disease, many public policies and governmental strategies, termed as non-phamaceutical interventions (NPIs), are been tested amid the epidemic/pandemic situation. Currently, many of such public health measures have been discussed/proposed to decrease the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, by reducing the social contact in the population and, consequently, the transmission rate of the virus, alleviating the health system and providing time for auxiliary measures (expansion of the system, military hospitals and so on).Mathematical modelling is a recognized powerful tool to investigate transmission and epidemic dynamics [9] [10] [11] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Here, we present a data-driven and census-based age-structured mathematical epidemiological model capable of asserting the potential output of many NPI over the Brazillian health system by explicitly computing the basic reproduction rate R 0 , the evolution of the number of infections and the required quantity of ICUs needed over time. The model is a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each layer of the age stratification reported for the COVID-19 within the Brazilian population. It is a variation of the SIRD model stratified by age group in which people flow among four states: susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R) and dead (D), assuming that the recovered population do not become susceptible, as is suggested for COVID-19. By modeling the current Brazilian scenario, we investigate the effects of applying one of the following NPI policies (or a combination of those): 0) a complete absence of control measures (No NPI); 1) closure of schools and universities (CSU); 2) Social distancing of those over sixty years old (SD60+); 3) voluntary home quarantine (VHQ) and social distance of the entire population (Quarantine).It is worth mentioning that all of these measures have direct social-economical and ethical implications because it severely reduces individual freedoms, spontaneous social aggregations, interferes in the outflow of industrial products and commodities and so on. However, we deal with a epidemiological model, not capable of inferring the by-product of the NPIs over the overall well-being of the population. Therefore, it is virtually impossible for governments simultaneously to minimize the socialeconomical impact of COVID-19 pandemic and protect the health system, which means minimising deaths. The case of China indicates in practice that some NPIs (quaratine, social distancing, isolation of infected individuals) can contain the virus spread [6] , but as soon as the measures are relaxed another outbreak can take place [23] possibly triggered by imported cases, meaning that, probably, NPIs are going to be necessary from time to time. As we will see, our model predicts that for the Brazilian scenario, only intense quarantine (essentially a combination of NPIs) can prevent the collapse of the health system and consequently save a larger number of lives.

II. MODEL

In the absence of a vaccine, the behavior of the individuals takes a crucial role in the course of an epidemic such as the COVID-19 in Brazil. In a nutshell, and as schematically shown in Fig. 1 , susceptible (S) individuals can become infected mainly by direct interaction with infected (I) persons at a rate β, who can recover (R) at a rate α and become resistant to the virus or die (D) at a rate γ. If, on average, one infected person contaminates one or more individuals, the epidemic is sustainable, otherwise it dies out. This is the definition of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which represents the average number of secondary cases from a single infectious case in a totally susceptible population (in the very beginning of the infection the susceptible population corresponds approximately to the total population N , S ≈ N ), defined as R 0 = β/(α + γ). Therefore, it is very important to reduce transmission rate in order to reduce the subsequent reproduction ratio R n (not to mistaken with the number of recovered individuals) so that R n < 1 and epidemic fades out. In the unlikely worst case scenario in which the government does not impose any measures for containing the infectious disease, R will decrease below unit due to exhaustion of susceptible individuals, at the expense of a tremendous amount of infected and dead individuals, collapsing not only the health system but the economy as well.Let us define S(t), I(t), R(t), D(t), the number of susceptible, infected, recovered and dead individuals, respectively, at time t in a population of size N . The latest Census-based data for Brazil N = 211, 319, 631 [24] . Our SIRD model is composed of 36 coupled ordinary differential equations since i belongs to one of the nine age with rate βi, who can recover (Ri) at a rate αi or die (Di) at a rate γi, the recovered populations do not become susceptible, as is suggested for COVID-19 [12] . The NPIs policies serve as a barrier to contain the infection. The quantity (giSi) represents the fraction of people not respecting the NPI policy, therefore still susceptible. groups as seen in Table I , yielding the kinematics of the variables, as follows:where dx/dt is the derivative of variable x with respect to time, hence a time variation. In this manner, the corresponding right hand side of each equation provides the variation amount of the variable in time t, increasing or decreasing if the amount if positive or negative, respectively. Here, S i represents the susceptible individuals for age group i, I i stands for infected individuals in age group i, R indicates the recovered individuals no more susceptible to infection, and D is the death total. The variable I = 9 i=1 I i is the total number of infected people in a given time t. Here, β i , α i and γ i denote the apparent per day infection (as suggested by data), recovery and mortality rates for the age group i, respectively. Note that these parameters do not correspond to the actual per day infection, recovery and mortality rates as the new cases of recovered and deaths come from infected cases several .

However, one can attempt to provide some coarse estimations of the apparent values of these epidemiological parameters based on the reported confirmed cases using an assumption and approach described in the next section, see Table I . The parameter g i represents the governmental strategies and/or public policies for the age group i or a combination of them (see Table II ).In our SIRD model it is assumed that the total number of the population remains constant (dead also included), once the sum Eqs. 1 implies a null derivative. If the rate at which infected persons need intensive care units (ICU) is known, we can described it asH means the healthcare demand due to hospitalized cases requiring critical attention in ICU. This equation can be coupled to the previous system (1) to estimate the time evolution of the health system demand (H). It is worth mentioning that the critical cases require long hospitalization, meaning that we will neglect the beds vacancies generated by recoveries or deaths. Although the number of ICUs is massively concentrated in capitals and big urban centers [13] , this in-homogeneity is not considered in our model, that should be seen as an average over all different regions in Brazil. The model can be improved to account for a contact matrix C i j given the probability of contact between the age groups, however it would be only a heuristic guess, so we decide not to include it here. , social distancing of people with more than 60 years old (SD60+), voluntary home quarantine (VHQ) and intense quarantine (IQ). It reflects the fraction of individuals still susceptible after the measure is applied per age group. However, none of them are suppose to be fully respected and/or other contacts result as a by-product of the measure [9] , except for the case of total closed schools and universities as is happening in Brazil at the time of writing, see more details in the main text. For combination of NPIs, one should take the lowest value in each corresponding row.

A. Modelling non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)

The parameter g i represents the NPI policies and, as in [9] , they are not supposed to have full compliance of the individuals. Further, as a by-product such NPIs might generated other kinds of social contacts, for instance, those due to the essential services that continue running even in a mandatory quarantine. For combination of NPIs, one should take the lowest value in each corresponding row of Table II . So, g i influences directly the spread of the disease, having strong effect on the efficacy of the infection process and can be interpreted as alterations of the β i parameter, resulting in an effective β ef f i = g i β i due to the imposed control measure. It comes from the reasonable assumption that in the early stage of the infection S ≈ N , therefore it fights the infection by reducing the number of susceptible persons. In our approach it reflects the amount of susceptible individuals undergoing the specific control measure and g i S i represents the fraction of S i not complying with the policy g i . Ahead we discussed the NPIs considered in this work along with the expected response from the population to these measures. In all cases, the compliance is not 100% effective [9] since that, for instance, many essential services are needed, so even in an intense and mandatory quarantine we supposed the 25% of the susceptible persons are still well exposed to the infection (see the fraction 0.25 in the last column of Table II ).In the lack of a vaccine, it is improbable that no NPI (g i = 1) policy would be applied. To estimate g i (reflecting the fraction of individuals still susceptible after the measure is applied) for the different NPIs and age groups . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint Table I ) by the total population N , discounted the corresponding number of infected in the age group. Ri(0) = 0 as at the time of writing it was not a significant data (just 6 recovered individuals). It is a common assumption for early stages of the infection, as is the case in Brazil and in many other countries.we follow a approach as in Ref [9] . For the case of closure of school and universities (CSU), we use the census-based data of the number of students per age group to reduce the respective number of susceptible individuals. They are all supposed to be uninfected in the early stage of the epidemic and we assume that 100% of this target population will not disobey the policy as all schools and universities are closed in Brazil. The third column of Table II is the unit minus the values in the third column of Table I . For social distancing of people over 60 years old (SD60+) we assume that 75% will comply with this policy, meaning that 25% will leak the isolation, therefore the fraction 0.25 in the last three rows of Table II . For voluntary home quarantine (VHQ) and social distancing of the entire population (Quarantine) the compliance is 50% and 75%, meaning that the remaining quantity of susceptible individuals in each age group is factor of 0.5 and 0.25 of their population, respectively. See Table II to check g i for each NPI. As the measures are not capable of producing effects instantaneously, taking in general t β = 14 days be effective [21] , we have to apply a modulation in the g i parameter in a similar fashion as done in Ref. [21] . Thus, we model g i aswhere this modulation function is the sigmoid function, t N P I is the date at which the measure is implemented and t β is the number of days it takes to produce effects.

B. Initial Conditions and Model Calibration

For the model to reflect well the scenarios for the next days according to the adopted public policies, one has to inform the proper initial conditions as well as the model parameters. The corresponding initial conditions (S i (0), I i (0), R i (0), D i (0)) were taken from the data available for the Brazilian case at the time of writing. Differently, from what has been done by many countries, the data from the national ministry of health is not informed in an age-structured manner. For that reason, we collected the data from epidemiological bulletins from the health secretaries from the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceará, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, Mato Grosso do Sul, Alagoas and the Distrito Federal, counting 730 infected cases as of 21th March 2020 (the initial time step in our simulations), corresponding to around 65% of the confirmed cases at that date.We assume that this distribution reflects well the overall national distribution. So the input for I i (0) is the multiplication of the infected distribution p[I i (0)] by the official number of infected persons at the March 21, 2020, that is, N inf ected = 1128. The death distribution is more accurate given that the national ministry of health provides this information directly, as informed in the third column of Table III . Thus, the input D i (0) is also the multiplication of the death distribution p[D i (0)] by the total number of dead individuals at the time of writing (N dead = 92). The input S i (0) is just multiplication of corresponding age group population percentage (second . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint column in Table I ) by the total population N , discounted the corresponding number of infected in the age group. Because at the time of writing the number of recoveries is neglible (just 6 recovered individuals), we set R i (0) = 0. We remark that this is a common assumption to model infections at early stages, as is the case in Brazil and in many other countries.The calibration of the model requires robust data so that the model parameters can be as realistic as possible. In the absence of such that for the Brazilian case, we used some data reported in studies with the largest number of individuals with an age-distributed fatality rate (γ i ) [1] and the percentage of persons undergoing critical intense care (c i ) [2] . For the recovery rate (α i ) we use the assumption that α i = (1 − γ i ) * r, where r is the overall fraction of recovery in the closed cases, known so far to be r = 0.82, meaning that 82% of those who did not succumb to the disease are now healed [7] . This does not imply a overall death ratio of 18%, since it accounts only for closed cases, in which one can compute statistics. Although this fraction could change over time, the statistics is reliable since the number of total closed cases is N closed = 191, 623, roughly 25% of the confirmed cases at the time of writing. The parameter β i describes the efficacy of the infection process and can be measure indirectly. Our first assumption is that this efficacy depends weakly on the age group, therefore β i = β is a constant vector. The effective value of β can be computed as R 0 = β αi+γ i , where x stands for the mean value of the variable x and R 0 reproduction number already defined and calculated to be in the range 1.5 − 6.0 in many countries [9, 11] . We will estimate the R 0 by performing a fit in our model with current data available. Given the current control measures in Brazil (a combination of CSU, HVQ and SD60+) our current g i is the concatenation of the corresponding columns in Table II , taking the lowest values.The data fitting shown in Fig. 2 indicates that in Brazil the R 0 ≈ 3 is still high nevertheless the current control measures. It means that one infected person, on average, is contaminating 3 other individuals. A clear indication that Brazil should not relax the NPIs adopted so far. In fact, as we will show in the next section, even stronger measures are going to be needed to avoid surpassing the capacity of the national health system and, consequently, minimize the number of severe cases and deaths. As we seek to estimate the demand for ICUs and it depends heavily on the number of infected (see Eq. 6), we are going to use to value of R 0 which best fits the variable I, so R 0 = 2.9 even though the fit for D seems better. It implies β = R 0 * (α i + γ i ) = 2.39.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

With the model initialized and callibrated as described in the previous section, we obtain the results by solving the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given by Eqs.(1) to (5) with the Julia Programming . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Language's package DifferentialEquations [28] .Our main result is to show that, even though the current NPI measure taken in Brazil have led to a substantial decrease in the number of infections as compared to no NPI since the beginning of the reported cases in Brazil (see red and blue curves in Fig. 3 (bottom) ), the current measures are not enough to prevent the collapse of the health system in a short period of time with million of infected persons (see Fig. 3 (top) and Fig. 4) .Even with the combination of CSU, HVQ and SD60+ taking place, our model predicts millions of infected individuals, with a peak at the first weeks of May 2020 (see Fig. 3 (top)), and consequently an exponential increase in the demand for ICUs. In fact, as can seen in Fig. 4 , already at the end of April we will surpass the current capacity of ICUs. The health system is still under treat in the current scenario, indicated to collapse by the end of Abril, 2020 (around 30 days after t0 == March 21, 2020), vigorously crossing the 5500 ICUs barrier. Moreover, the scenario is even worse if the imposed NPIs are relaxed (as being constantly debated by the Brazilian federal government), pointing out tens of millions of infected individuals, see black curve in Fig. 3 (bottom) .On the positive side, we have also identified a window of 25 days -from the March 21st to April 16th -in which, similarly to what has been done in China, if more severe control measures are be applied, one can control the virus spread and keep the ICU demand below the threshold (see the green curve in Fig. 4) . Given that the actual NPI scenario in Brazil is represented by the combination of the lowest values of the g i functions in Table II for CSU, SD60+ and VHQ, the only possible measure is an intense quarantine (last column of Table  II) . Except a intense quarantine, all the other scenarios are more catastrophic, meaning a faster collapse of the system. Although an emergence expansion and/or other measures can be tried, it is unlikely to keep the pace with the exponential spread of the infection. Even if we are underestimating the number of available ICUs, the saturation will still take place for the current scenario (as it shows a positive concavity), being only reversed with the intense quarantine implementation.In our model, this intense quarantine is supposed to be applied around 20 days after our initial time (March, 21) . As discussed in the NPI section, no measure is instantaneous efficient, taking on average a time t β ≈ 14 days to be completely noticed [21] . In spite of that, notice that the increase in the ICU demand is rapidly contained. Moreover, it is important to mention that such a intense quarantine should last enough time until we reach a plateau in the ICU demand. Not only the quarantine protects the health system, but also corresponds to a minimization of the number of deaths, massively reducing it.In Tables V and VI, we show the estimated number of infected people and deaths, respectively, in the current scenario as well as if other NPI measures start to take place at April 11th (20 days after March 21st). Observe how the total of infected is still very high in the current scenario: around 3.15 million infected individual, with an astonishing 393 thousands deaths. As discussed, the only scenario which considerably reduces the number of infected persons and deaths is an intense quarantine. It reduces to 34.5 thousand infections and 1300 deaths. In particular, we notice that changing the current NPI to SD60+ (f social distancing of people above 60 years old) as been currently discussed by the Brazilian federal government, is completely catastrophic. As this group corresponds to the majority of critical care demands and deaths, their isolation is certainly necessary. However, taken alone it leads to ≈ 27 millions infected and 723 thousand dead individuals (see the fifth columns in Tables V and VI). An important observation is that our . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint predictions are likely to be a lower bound to the actual numbers, since the confirmed cases are potentially underestimated given the lack of a widespread clinical testing in Brazil with more accurate data, it is possible that the fitting in Fig 2 would produce an even higher value for R 0 . In addition, our model can be applied to other countries or regions with minimal adaptation, since it will require only updates in Tables I -III . Finally, although we have employed many data-driven assumptions, the results presented here may still underestimate the threat to the national health system due to the particular social problems in Brazil, such as: (i) high level of cardiopathologies, a reported relevant comorbidity; (ii) considerable number of people without proper water and wasting supplies; (iii) large number of people living in the same house in peripheral zones due to housing deficit, (iv) high density of obesity cases and some other immune suppressant diseases, just to cite a few. On the positive side, there can be a potential defense against SARS-Cov-2 for those BCG-vaccinated [29] , which belongs to the universal vaccination program in Brazil [30] . Furthermore, the public health system in Brazil has great capillarity, in principle being capable to identify potential cases in the very beginning of the symptoms. However, that also requires widespread clinical tests to identify infected individuals.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work we proposed a data-driven age-structured census-based SIRD-like epidemiological model capable of forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil in a number of NPI scenarios. We remark that our approach is fairly general and thus can be applied to treat particular regions or cities, if the required data is available.As we have shown, the early NPI measures taken by states and cities such as the total closure of schools, universities and non-essential services, the social distancing and isolation of individuals above 60 years and the voluntary home quarantine have already lead to significant reduction in the number of infections as well as delaying the time for the peak of contamination. Thus, these measures have been extremely important to give the authorities the necessary time for the adapting and preparing before the peak of the epidemy.Notwithstanding, the current measures are not enough. Our model predicts that even if the current NPIs are not relaxed, as early as mid April the number of severe cases requiring hospitalization will surpass the current number of available ICUs, starting the collapse of the health system. However, a intense quarantine, if implemented in the following days, can rapidly change the increase in the number of infections and keep the demand for ICUs below the threshold, amounting to hundred of thousands of saved lives. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the relaxation of the already imposed control measures in the next days, as currently debated at some sphere of the Brazilian federal government, would be catastrophic, with a total death toll passing the one million mark.In a nutshell, a continued quarantine, tighter than the current one and with a duration of a couple of weeks, is most likely the only solution to avoid the collapse of the health systems in Brazil. We hope that the gigantic difference in numbers, showing how different measures can lead to a reduction in infections and deaths of the order of hundreds of thousands or even millions, can provide a rational guide for the future decisions by the competent authorities. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052498 doi: medRxiv preprint

"Abstract

Background: Since late December 2019, novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries, and several countries' government rush to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. We analyzed the infection rate of the evacuees and extrapolated the results in Wuhan's NCP incidence estimation. Methods: We collected the total number and confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection in the evacuation of Korea, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and France and estimated the infection rate of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) among people who were evacuated from Wuhan with a meta-analysis. NCP incidence of Wuhan was indirectly estimated based on data of evacuation.

","Introduction

In the late December 2019, a pneumonia, now known as novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [1] . The outbreak of NCP quickly showed the characteristic of human-to-human transmission. Chinese health authorities did an immediate investigation to characterize and control the disease, including isolation of suspected cases, monitoring of close contacts, collection of epidemiological and clinical data from confirmed patients, and development of diagnostic and treatment procedures [2] . As of Feb 4, 2020, a total of 24,324 cases with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection have been detected in China, of whom 490 have died [3] . There were 8,351 cases confirmed in Wuhan, 362 of the confirmed cases have died, the case fatality was much higher in Wuhan than in the other areas of China [4] . Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries. After assessing the virus-related information, the WHO decided to declare it as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on Jan 31, 2020 [5] .All rights reserved.

The local government in Wuhan announced on Jan 23, 2020, the suspension of public transportation, with closure of airports, railway stations, and highways in the city, to prevent further disease transmission [6] .Wuhan as the epicenter of this outbreak, the outbreak size is of great significance for understanding the status of the epidemic in Wuhan, predicting the trend of the epidemic, and formulating strategy for prevention and control. Several studies estimated the outbreak size in Wuhan to date. Using a transmission model, British researchers estimated Wuhan case ascertainment of 5.0% (3.6-7.4); 21,022 (11,090-33,490) total infections in Wuhan from 1 to 22 Jan 2020 [7] . In addition, [8] . In order to fill in the gap of the status of outbreak in Wuhan, we provide an estimate of the epidemic size in Wuhan based on several countries' evacuation data.

Data sources

We collected information of evacuations from Wuhan using charter flights by five countries from Jan 29 to Feb 2, 2020 through their health authority website or other media. During this week, Korea has evacuated 701 people, and 2 cases were confirmed infection with an infection rate 0.29% [9, 10] ; Japan has evacuated 565 people, and 9 cases were confirmed with an infection rate 1.59% [11] ; Germany has evacuated 124 people, and 2 cases were confirmed with an infection rate 1.61% [12] ; Singapore All rights reserved.

Statistical analysis

Infection rate of 2019-nCov among people who were evacuated from Wuhan were pooled through one group meta-analysis method with random effect model.Comprehensive Meta Analysis Software V2.0 was used. Based on the number of current people stay in Wuhan, we quickly estimated the outbreak size.

Results

Totally 1,916 people have been evacuated from Wuhan, among them 17 have been confirmed 2019-nCov infected. Based on the data above, the infection rate was calculated to be 1.1% (95% CI 0.4%-3.1%) using one group meta-analysis method with random effect model (Figure 1 ). According to the mayor of Wuhan, who introduced the progression of epidemic prevention and control of NCP, there are still more than 9 million people staying in Wuhan at that time. We estimated that there are 10 million people in Wuhan, considered the infection rate calculated above, it is estimated that almost 110,000 (95% CI: 40,000-310,000) people were infected with 2019-nCov in Wuhan around Feb 2, 2020, with an assumption that the risk of infection of evacuees is similar to Chinese in Wuhan.

Discussion

This estimate is consistent with 21,022 (11,090-33,490) total infections from Jan 1 to 22, 2020 estimated by Read and colleagues [7] and 75,815 individuals (95% CI 37,304-130,330) as of Jan 25, 2020 by Joseph's team if progression of the epidemic was accounted for [8] , but it is much higher than the number that Chinese authority reported.Although these evacuees cannot completely represent the overall population stay in Wuhan, they tended to have certain lifestyle which may be different with local All rights reserved.

Nonetheless, we believe that our results of estimated number of 2019-nCov infections in Wuhan is close to the actual situation. At the beginning of the outbreak, incidence of NCP may be vastly underestimated because of asymptomatic infection, no timely diagnosis, inadequate supplies and low sensitiviy of nCov Kit. Our result emphasizes that 2019-nCov has proposed a huge public health threats in Wuhan.China need to respond based on current actual infections and predictions based on the estimates. Joint efforts need to be done by whole society in order to control the epidemic.

East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 2 As of March 9 th , 2020, COVID-19 has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide and caused more than 3,500 deaths, and the data are still increasing; in Wuhan, the fatality rate of COVID-19 was 4.8% (2404/49965). Of note, critically ill patients with COVID-19 have a high mortality rate. In a study of 52 critically ill patients in Wuhan, 32 (61.5%) patients died at 28 days and the mortality rate was 81.1% (30/37) in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. 3 Accumulated evidence has strongly demonstrated that systemic inflammatory response, acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluid overload (FO) were associated with high mortality in severe sepsis. [4] [5] [6] In critically ill patients with COVID-19, the overwhelming inflammation including C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were observed, 7-10 which is consistent with patients suffering from SARS-CoV 11 and MERS-CoV. 12 Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a great help in critically ill patients not only to control of electrolyte, acid-base derangements but also to remove inflammatory mediators and improves oxygenation in fluid overload. [13] [14] [15] CRRT has been applied to critically ill patients, including patients with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other viral infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease. 14, 16 However, the benefits of CRRT are still no consistent conclusion in critically ill patients. 17 CRRT significantly reduced the level of IL-6 and decreases hospital mortality rate in pediatric severe sepsis, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 18 Besides, a meta-analysis revealed that patients who received CRRT had significantly lower mortality compared to conventional therapy. 19 Hoverer, CRRT was associated with increased mortality in patients with MERS-CoV. 16 The relationship between CRRT and patients' outcome varied in patients with the different disease and was effected by the modalities, anticoagulation, vascular access management, timing of initiation and intensity of CRRT. 17, 20, 21 To date, no specific treatment has been confirmed to be effective for COVID-19, and supportive treatment remains essential. As far as we know, the effect of CRRT on critically ill patients with COVID-19 has not been reported. In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to explore the effect of CRRT on all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and the risk factors for mortality in patients with CRRT treatment.

). The laboratory data were collected throughout the study as follows: routine blood test, blood glucose, total cholesterol, hypersensitive Creactive protein (hCRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, coagulation function, liver and renal function, lactic acid, high sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and inflammatory factors, including IL-1β, IL-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α. All information is obtained and managed through established data collection forms. Two researchers independently reviewed and collected the data.

CRRT Procedures

We performed CRRT with an ultrafiltration rate of 25-75 mL/kg/hr, performed using commercially available pump-driven machines (PrismaFlex, Gambro, Sweden; or multiFiltrate, Fresenius, Germany) and filter (M150, Gambro; Oxiris, Baxter; or AV1000s, Fresenius). For the patients with AKI, hemofiltration plus hemodialysis were performed. The blood flow rate was set on 2.5-4 mL/kg/min, and the clearance rate was set on 40-75 mL/min. The filter circuit was prewashed with saline containing 5,000-6,250 IU/L heparin. Vascular access was obtained with 13.5F central venous catheters (Covidien, MA, USA) in femoral vein.

Outcomes

We followed up all patients through electronic hospital medical records. The outcome was death.All patients were followed until death or March 9 th , and all survivors were followed for at least one week. There was no loss to follow-up patients.

Statistical analysis

Numeric data were presented as the means and standard deviation (SD) or medians (interquartile range [IQR]) and were analyzed using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test depending on the data distribution. Categorical variables were displayed as frequencies and percentages and were analyzed using the Chi-squared test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival, and the log-rank test was used to evaluate differences between the two groups. The Cox regression model was conducted to adjust for potential confounders, including age, sex, the baseline values, and the average values of all tests between the start of invasive mechanical ventilation and the endpoint. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed for all-cause mortality, the significant variants in the univariate analysis and the variables which have clinical significance were selected for inclusion in a multivariate ""backward"" stepwise Cox regression analysis. SPSS 23.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) statistical software was used for statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, USA) was used for statistical analysis and visualization. A P-value of 0.05 or less was considered significant.

Description of the cohort

In total, 36 COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation were enrolled in the study. Table 1 showed the baseline characteristics of the cohort patients. There were 30 men (83.3%) and 6 women (16.7%), ranging in age from 44 and 86 years. Common comorbidity factors in COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation were hypertension (n=14, 38.9%) and cardiac disease (n=12, 33.3%). The mean/median level of inflammatory markers (including white blood cell count, neutrophil count, hCRP, procalcitonin, and ferritin) and cardiac injury biomarkers (including hs-cTnI and NT-proBNP) were higher than normal.We divided the study participants into two groups according to the CRRT treatment.Twenty-two patients received CRRT (CRRT group) while fourteen patients did not (non-CRRT group). There was no difference between two groups in baseline age, sex, comorbidities, complications, treatments and most of the laboratory findings, except for patients received CRRT with higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.034) and serum creatinine (p=0.017).

invasive mechanical ventilation

The mean follow-up period was 10.4 days. During the follow-up, 12 of 22 (54.5%) patients in CRRT group and 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients in non-CRRT group died. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients in CRRT group fared prolonged survival than those in non-CRRT group (P=0.032) ( Figure 1 ).In Cox regression analysis, seven different models were used to analyze the adjusted hazard ratio of CRRT treatment. Consistently, the association between CRRT treatment and a reduced risk of mortality remained significant after adjusting for selected confounding factors, such as age, sex, the baseline laboratory findings, or the average values of all tests between the start of invasive mechanical ventilation and the endpoint. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of CRRT treatment fluctuated between 0.283 and 0.424 (Table 2) .

Risk factors for all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation with CRRT treatment

We further conducted univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis for all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation with CRRT. After adjusting the prognostic significance of clinical factors including age, sex, inflammatory factors, coagulation function, liver, and renal function, and cardiac function, we demonstrated that older age (aHR=1.112, P=0.025), higher levels of IL-1β (aHR=1.292, P=0.012), IL-2 receptor (aHR=1.002, P=0.013), hs-cTNI (aHR=1.001, P=0.004), and NT-proBNP (aHR=1.256, P=0.008) were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality ( Table 3 ).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this current study is the first cohort study to estimate the association between CRRT treatment and mortality of COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. We the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 16.20036780 doi: medRxiv preprint aHR ranging from 0.283 to 0.424 in seven different models.Excessive inflammation characterized by uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in circulation is the main cause of death from sepsis, 23,24 infection of influenza virus, 25 Ebola virus, 26 MERS-CoV, 27 SARS-CoV. 28 In our study, we found inflammatory storm might play a crucial role in critical COVID-19 patients. The mean/median level of inflammatory markers, IL-1β, IL-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, hCRP, procalcitonin, and ferritin were higher than normal.For example, the average of peaks for IL-6 was 1081.7 pg/mL, which was more than 100 times higher than the upper limit of normal value (reference range: < 7 pg/mL). Inflammatory storm may originate from the following aspects. First, SARS-Cov-2 infects patients by binding human ACE2, 29, 30 which is widely expressed in multiple organs throughout the body. 31 SARS-CoV-2 might lead to multi-system inflammation through ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway. 32, 33 Second, it was reported that antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses might also be involved in COVID-19. ADE can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, which makes it a possible explanation for the geographic limitation of severe cases. 34 Third, combined infections may lead to a more severe systemic inflammatory response. Indeed, in our study, some patients combined with infection in other organs (e.g. urinary tract, blood) and other pathogen (e.g. influenza virus, fungus). Fourth, shock, hypoxemia and coagulation pathway abnormalities in critical patients could aggravate systemic inflammatory response, which become a vicious cycle, threatening life. 35, 36 In our study, CRRT was associated with prolonged survival in COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. CRRT is a widely used blood purification therapy, which achieves a high solute clearance rate through diffusion, convection, ultrafiltration, and adsorption. The primary goal of CRRT is to compensate for the loss of renal function and associated sequelae, including uremic toxins, electrolyte disturbances, metabolic acidosis, and volume overload 37 . Besides these, CRRT can also remove cytokines from the bloodstream. Emerging evidence has shown that CRRT was associated with significantly lower mortality in patients with severe sepsis. 18, 19, 38 In addition, in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, CRRT could remove All rights reserved.

[39] [40] [41] However, it is controversial whether CRRT is beneficial in viral pneumonia. CRRT was reported to have a positive effect on the treatment of adenovirus pneumonia 42 .While other studies revealed that CRRT was a risk factor for mortality in patients with MERS-CoV 16 Although CRRT treatment improved patient survival, 54.5% of patients with CRRT treatment died during our follow-up. In patients with CRRT, we further explored the risk factors for death for better management and treatment. We derived that older age, and higher levels of IL-1β, IL-2 receptor, hs-cTnI, and NT-proBNP were independently associated with a higher allcause mortality in patients with CRRT.IL-1β is known as a lymphocyte-stimulating factor, produced by activated monocytemacrophages. 45, 46 It plays an immunomodulatory role to induce synthesis of acute phase protein causing fever and cachexia, active antigen-presenting cell and T cells, and promote the proliferation and secretion of antibodies of B cells in innate and acquired immunity. 47-49 IL-2 receptor is widely expressed on the surface of IL-2 target cells, including T cells, B cells, and monocyte macrophage, promoting cytotoxic action, secretion of the antibody, production of IFN-γ, TNF-β, TGF-β and non-specific cytotoxins.

"Abstract

medRxiv preprint BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2 has caused a series of COVID-19 globally. SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemiaThe patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia.RESULTSFeb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients.Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P>0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K + loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. 1 severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K + supplements when they were inclined to recovery.

may reflect the progression of COVID-19 and should be closely monitored is hypokalemia. K + ions are the predominant intracellular cations and influence membrane polarization of cells. Hypokalemia results in cellular hyperpolarity, increases resting potential, and hastens depolarization in cardiac cells and lung cells 7 .Severe hypokalemia of under 3 mmol/L plasma K + can trigger ventricular arrhythmia and respiratory muscle dysfunction, both conditions being life-threatening in patients in severe COVID-19 condition. This knowledge implies that hypokalemia may have a consuderable impact on the treatment outcome of patients with COVID-19 and should be seriously tackled as these patients have a high prevalence of dysfunction in heart, lungs, and other vital organs.As little is known about the prevalence of hypokalemia and its adverse effects on the treatment outcomes of patients with COVID-19, here we reported the high prevalence of hypokalemia in such patients and investigated the relevant causes and clinical meaning. We also aimed to determine the possible relationship between hypokalemia and the treatment outcomes of these patients.

STUDY POPULATION

This study included patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital for infectious diseases in the city Wenzhou of China from Jan 11 to Feb 15, 2020. All patients were aged ≥14 years old and were diagnosed to have COVID-19 according to

RESULTS

During the study period, 175 patients with COVID-19 were included, consisting of 92 women and 83 men ( Table 1 ). The median age was 46 (IQR, 34-54) years.Fifty-seven (33%) patients had a history of exposure to the epidemic area. The patients consisted of 39 patients with severe hypokalemia (<3 mmol/L), 69 patients with hypokalemia (3-3.5 mmol/L), and 67 patients with normokalemia (>3.5 All rights reserved.

A total of 108 patients with hypokalemia exhibited moderate decreases in sodium, white blood cells, and lymphocyte than the 67 patients with normokalemia. Among these 108 patients, 39 patients exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms had a mean plasma K + of 3.22 (SD, 0.22) mmol/L, which was not statistically different from the mean value of 3.26 (SD, 0.28) mmol/L in 69 patients without gastrointestinal symptoms. Regarding the urine K + output, 20 patients with hypokalemia had a mean K + concentration of 32 (SD, 11) mmol/gram of creatinine, which was statistically higher than the corresponding mean of 18 (SD, 7) mmol/gram of creatinine for 20 patients with normokalemia (P<0.01).In the part of CT and ECG examinations, nearly all patients had pulmonary ground-glass opacities, in trast, abnormal ECG results were significantly correlated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01) as the prevalence of abnormal ECG results was 77%, 33%, and 15% for patients with severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia, respectively.

Severe and critically ill patients had higher occurrence of severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, abnormal ECG presentations, as well as elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP (all P<0.01). Among these abnormal indices, hypokalemia was most common as 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia. In contrast, elevated BUN and creatinine were rare. Abnormal ECG presentations were usually representative of hypokalemia and improved with K + supplement treatment.Elevated CK, CK-MB, and LDH often came to normal level within 3-6 days ( Figure   1 ). Elevated ALT and AST were generally mild and came to normal level after liver support therapy (Table 2 and Table 4 ).

DISCUSSION

The current study illustrated the high prevalence of hypokalemia in the patients with COVID-19 and the positive association between the degree of hypokalemia and the severity of COVID-19. The study also proved that hypokalemia was more attributable to renal loss of K + than gastrointestinal loss.Previous literature has proved that sufficient and appropriate levels of plasma K + have a protective role in preventing myocardial failure through weakening cellular hyperpolarity and depolarization 10, 11 . SARS-CoV-2 can result in heart dysfunction due to the intensively expressed ACE2 in the patients' myocardial cells that act as receptors for this virus. Therefore, it is beneficial to patients that plasma K + levels be frequently checked and maintained between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L or 4.5 and 5.5 mmol/L for serum K + as serum generally has more K+ than plasma 12 . In the present study, hypokalemia was prevailing among the patients with COVID-19, up to 62% (108/175) patients having plasma K + that was under 3 mmol/L. Among 175 patients, only 10 patients had plasma K + of 4 mmol/L recommended for patients with myocardial dysfunction. That strikingly low prevalence of optimal concentration of plasma K + implied a massive risk for the patients' heart to be affected by both hypokalemia and the virus. As an emerging infectious disease, the available data on serum K + levels is scanty. Only one previous study on 41 patients reported 4.2 mmol/L as the mean serum K + , as well as higher K + in the ICU patients (mean, 4.6 important indices for hypokalemia, myocardial injury, and evaluation of disease. We expected these arrangements of results might facilitate future studies.Seeing that hypokalemia was prevalent among patients with COVID-19 and associated with the severity of the disease, elucidation of the mechanisms for hypokalemia was elementary for understanding and treatment of COVID-19. In the current situation, two probable causes of hypokalemia are increased gastrointestinal loss and increased urinary loss 15 . Both causes can find their way in the patients with COVID-19, as mentioned in the introduction section. However, the present findings indicated that gastrointestinal loss might not contribute much to hypokalemia as based on the following reasons: only a small proportion of patients with hypokalemia showing gastrointestinal symptoms, e.g., 31% of patients with severe hypokalemia having diarrhea; among the patients with hypokalemia, no significant difference between those with and those without diarrhea; the average number of diarrhea onsets being 5 times/day and diarrhea ending in a short time, meaning that the diarrhea was mild. Therefore, hypokalemia might principally result from increased urine loss. This was proved in this study by the dramatically increased urine K + output in the hypokalemia group than the control group with normokalemia. This finding that increased urine K + was the primary cause of hypokalemia was consistent with the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. This virus drives RAS towards enhanced ACE-Ang II (angiotensin II)-Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) axis by degrading ACE2 that is the principal counter-regulatory mechanism for the central axis of the RAS 4 . The final effect of this disturbance of RAS is the increased distal delivery of sodium and water All rights reserved.

This effect is similar to the effect of aldosterone that stimulates water and sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion and thus increases body water and blood pressure 16 .As hypokalemia has an adverse effect on myocardial functions, in-time treatment is required for achieving good outcomes. However, the mechanism of hypokalemia in the present study hinted that it was challenging to achieve normokalemia in the presence of continuous renal loss of K + . This worry was proved by the elevated amount of urine K + measured in umol/gram of creatinine ( Figure 1 ). The continual K + supplements had very little effect on the return of normokalemia when the urine loss of K + persisted in the severe cases. Interestingly, we found a noteworthy phenomenon in most patients who were cured of COVID-19. As shown in Figure 1 , when patients were inclined to recovery, they responded well to K + supplement treatment and steadily returned to normokalemia. This phenomenon indicated the end of urine loss of K + due to disordered RAS balance; in other words, the ACE2 function began to return. This exciting finding suggested that return of normokalemia might be a reliable biomarker for monitoring ACE2 function.Although COVID-19 causes injury to lungs, heart, liver, and kidney, our study showed the occurrence of abnormal indices related to heart, liver, and kidney was low, and oxygen saturation often returned to normal level upon oxygen inhalation in most patients ( Table 2 and Table 4 ). Several laboratory indices, such as elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, ALT and AST were usually came to normal level or substantially improved after relevant treatment. The superficial mildness contradicted with the sudden progression of disease in some patients. This contradiction might result from the fact that the biomarkers were not sensitive to reflect the whole progression of this disease. Therefore, a more sensitive biomarker to monitor the ongoing condition is All rights reserved.

As discussed above, 93% severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia, showing that depletion of K + was prevailing. Based on analysis of the trend in plasma K + and urine output of K + , the end of the depletion often suggested a good prognosis (Figure 1) . Therefore, comprehensive analysis of K + depletion can be achieved by monitoring urine K + loss, plasma K + , and the response to K + supplement treatment. Importantly, the information from this analysis related to hypokalemia directly reflects the very basis of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and might be a reliable, int-time and sensitive biomarker to reflect the progression of COVID-19.The present study had some limitations. Most patients were still hospitalized.Only a small proportion of cases were used to evaluate the treatment outcomes.However, from several patients who had been cured, the principal results related to hypokalemia treatment were consistent, which could provide reliable information.Since this life-threatening disease is still ongoing in China and is developing in several countries, we expect our findings can provide timely information about better understanding and treatment of COVID-19.To summarize, the present study has identified the prevailing hypokalemia in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal loss of potassium resulting from the degradation of ACE2 by the binding of SAR-CoV-2. The end of loss of K + often indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker that reflects the end of adverse effect on the RAS system by SAR-CoV-2. Due to the possible injury to cardiovascular functions, neurohormonal activation, and other vital organs by hypokalemia, clinicians should pay great attention to hypokalemia and the patients' response to K + supplements.

"Abstract

population. We report that domestication of the model yeast S. cerevisiae reprogrammed its life cycle entirely. We tracked growth, gamete formation and cell survival across many environments for nearly 1000 genome sequenced isolates and found a remarkable dichotomy between domesticated and wild yeasts. Wild yeasts near uniformly trigger meiosis and sporulate when encountering nutrient depletions, whereas domestication relaxed selection on sexual reproduction and favoured survival as quiescent cells. Domestication also systematically enhanced fermentative over respiratory traits while decreasing stress tolerance. We show that this yeast domestication syndrome was driven by aneuploidies and gene function losses that emerged independently in multiple domesticated lineages during the specie's recent evolutionary history. We found domestication to be the most dramatic event in budding yeast evolution, raising questions on how much domestication has distorted our understanding of this key model species.

","Introduction

Humans have domesticated plant and animal species over at least 12000 years to improve agricultural traits. Domestication greatly contributed to human population expansion and development by releasing labour from food production, but also profoundly altered the domesticated species. Controlled breeding and artificial selection on the segregating genetic diversity created plant and animal crops that now differ drastically from those of their ancestors and wild relatives 1 . Selected traits recur across domesticated species 2 and, due to pleiotropy and linkage, often come with specific, non-desired side-effects. Human-created niches may also impose quasi-domestication and unintentionally favour some traits and genetic variants with side-effects linked to them 3 . Both domestication and quasidomestication therefore results in suites of co-evolving traits, known as domestication syndromes 4, 5 .Domestication of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, dates back over 9000 years, with the earliest use in rice, honey and fruit fermentation 6 . Subsequent domestication for industrial or semi-industrial beer, dairy, rice, cocoa, coffee 7 , bread, palm sap and agave fermentation 8 transformed wild yeast lineages into specialized domesticated breeds [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Lab domestication and the subsequent use of budding yeast as a model organism resulted from efforts to breed pure, industrial beer strains 16 . Modern lab strains are genetic mosaics with genomes composed of DNA from diverse domesticated origins 17 . The continued existence of wild yeast not spoiled by extensive gene flow from feral domesticated yeast became accepted only recently 18, 19 . Wild strains are more diverse in terms of single nucleotide variation; domesticated lineages are instead distinguished by genome content variation in form of aneuploidies, polyploidies and the copy number of individual genes and chromosome segments [20] [21] [22] [23] . These structural and copy number variants in domesticated lineages may explain the high phenotypic variation among domesticated lineages and the unexpectedly large intraspecies phenotypic diversity in the species 9, 20, 21, 24 .While the impact of domestication on the yeast genome is well described, its effect on the yeast biology is poorly understood. The life cycle of an organism represents the very core of its organismal properties, directly defining its fitness. Life cycle changes are therefore dramatic evolutionary events with far-reaching consequences. Budding yeast reproduces asexually under nutrient abundance, expanding its population size. Growing cells first privatize and use the most easily catabolized carbon and nitrogen by repressing mitochondrial respiration and the uptake and use of non-preferred sources 25 . When the preferred sources are consumed, the repression is relaxed and yeast switches to nonpreferred sources, including by respiring the produced ethanol. When an essential nutrient becomes scarce, cell growth and the asexual population expansion ceases. Diploid cells then either pass through meiosis and enter a haploid spore state 26 , shift from unicellular to multicellular filamentous organization 27 or enter into a quiescent G0 stage 28 . These transitions favour survival by repressing metabolism, reproduction and translation, mobilizing nutrients intracellularly by autophagocytosis, and protecting against external challenges [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .When the nutrient status switches back to favourable, cells re-activate translation, rebuild growth-required cell functions, revert to single, vegetative cell status and re-initiate the asexual cell cycle 34 .We tracked asexual reproduction, entry into spore state and survival as quiescent cells across many environments for nearly 1000 genome sequenced S. cerevisiae strains 20 and 3 found a remarkable dichotomy between domesticated and wild yeasts. We found that domestication shifted yeast from respiratory to fermentative asexual reproduction and decreased resistance to stresses other than those associated with domestication environments. Concomitantly, domestication abolished or severely impaired the sexual life cycle and the capacity to enter into the protective haploid spore state. We traced genetic change driving this extraordinary yeast domestication syndrome to lineage-specific combinations of aneuploidies and loss-of-function mutations.

Domestication promoted fermentative over respiratory growth and lowered stress resistance

We first revisited published growth yields for 971 wild and domesticated budding yeast strains that reproduced asexually in 36 stress environments 20 We next measured doubling times and yields of these yeasts while using common carbon and nitrogen sources 19, 37 (Fig. 1, Supplementary data S1) . Domesticated yeasts were better adapted to maltose, sucrose and higher concentrations of glucose (>0.5%), fructose (>0.5%) and xylose (>2%); all carbon sources that characterize human-made fermenting niches 38 . Domesticated yeasts also better used isoleucine and valine, as well as threonine, which can be catabolized into isoleucine. Isoleucine and valine are degraded in the fermentation induced 39 Ehrlich pathway by Bat1 and Bat2, while threonine is also anaerobically catabolized to propionate during fermentation. Wild yeasts were better adapted to most respiratory carbon sources (ethanol, glycerol) as well as to lower concentrations (up to 1%) of sugars; lower sugar concentrations promote respiration by relieving the glucose repression of respiratory genes 40 . Wild yeasts were also better at using citrulline, serine and alanine. The metabolism of these compounds produces fumarate or pyruvate (and through the latter: oxaloacetate), which are Krebs cycle intermediates intrinsically linked to respiration. In addition, since the replenishment of a cyclic pathway can be achieved by any anaplerotic reactions, the net result of the production of any of the Krebs cycle intermediates would entail a larger availability of precursors for other paths (such as the gluconeogenesis or the mitochondrial production of ATP) 41 . Wild yeasts also better catabolized glycine and phenylalanine.. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.939314 doi: bioRxiv preprintWe finally traced carbon and nitrogen adaptations down to 853 variants, by GWAS (Supplementary data S1). The vast majority (96%, n=815) of these was private to either doubling time (d) or yield (y), consistent with the very low correlation (r 2 mean=0.16) of these fitness components across strains. We therefore conclude that the efficiency and rate of nutrient use likely evolved independently in budding yeast, and are independently regulated.We recovered known causes of domestication effects, e.g. SUC2 gain (sucrose use, d),MAL gene amplification (maltose use, d), DAL5 gain (citrulline use, d). We also disclosed many unknown effects, many of which were highly pleiotropic. Thus, yields in sugarrestricted niches often associated to the mitochondrial DNA polymerase MIP1 or the cytochrome C peroxidase CCP1, whereas the corresponding doubling times often associated to either SEC11 or COG2 dependent intracellular transport. We conclude that variation in yeast use of carbon and nitrogen are in line with domestication selecting for fermentative over respiratory growth.

Domestication abolished or impaired yeast sporulation

Yeast sporulation is known to be most efficiently induced by nitrogen starvation combined with respiratory growth 42,43 . We found wild yeasts (n=54) to sporulate rapidly in these conditions, while domesticated yeasts (n=503) were much slower (Fig. 2a) . In particular, the domesticated French Dairy, African beer and Sake clades sporulated very poorly, while the Wine/European S. boulardii subclade completely failed to sporulate (Supplementary fig. 2a and b). Yeast in clades of unassigned type (n=293) sporulated as domesticated yeasts.Among unassigned yeasts, French Guiana strains that colonize human bodies were virtually unable to sporulate (Supplementary fig. 2a ). We also determined how long the produced spores survives, by monitoring the spore lifespan of a wild (North American -AKN) and a well-sporulating domesticated (Wine/European -BTN) yeast. We found spore survival to remain amazingly high (>90%) without any detectable gamete mortality during the entire 8 weeks test period (Fig. 2b) .We next investigated the ability of wild yeasts to sporulate under the most extreme starvation, i.e. in water. We developed a high-throughput flow cytometry assay based on cell size and granularity (see methods and Fig. 2c ) to detect single (monad) and double (dyad) spores, as the former are not easily distinguished from unsporulated cells by microscopy.We found 88% of wild yeast to sporulate in complete absence of nutrients. Only 0.6% of the domesticated isolates did so, and when sporulating they produced fewer asci (Fig. 2d) .Neither wild nor domesticated yeasts capable of sporulating produced complete tetrads in water, forming only monads and dyads. This is consistent with spore numbers being controlled by carbon source availability 44 . To validate that domestication indeed abolished or impaired sporulation, we tracked sporulation in water across the never domesticated sister-species S. paradoxus (n=12 strains from 4 clades) and found it to be similar to that of wild S. cerevisiae (n=23) and much superior to that of domesticated S. cerevisiae (n=49) (Supplementary fig. 2c ).The capacity of wild yeast strains to sporulate and survive as spores in complete absence of external nutrients is important, as extreme starvation undoubtedly is a common challenge in natural habitats. We conclude that natural selection has maintained a remarkable capacity of wild yeasts to enter and survive in a haploid spore state, while domestication abolished or impaired this core organismal property. Because the domesticated clades have exchanged little or no genetic material, this abolishment of sporulation must have occurred independently multiple times during the yeast history.

Domestication impaired sporulation through aneuploidies and sporulation gene loss

Because sporulation variation was overwhelmingly due to additive genetic effects (Fig. 3a, narrow sense heritability, h 2 =0.89 and 0.88, respectively at 24 and 72 h), we next probed the underlying genetic architecture and first focused on macroscopic genomic changes.Genome homozygosity has been reported to promote meiosis and sporulation 45 , but disregarding the wild yeasts, which are all completely homozygous, we found no correlation to sporulation (Fig. 3b) . In fact, some populations (Sake, French Guiana, Wine/European S. boulardii subclade) had lost their sporulation capacity, despite high homozygosity. Because domesticated strains often carried ploidy variations, we next probed whether poly-or aneuploidy impaired sporulation. Tetraploid and triploid yeasts sporulated as often as diploid, and produced only marginally fewer asci at later time point (Fig. 3c) . In contrast, aneuploidy accounted for some of the early and late sporulation variation (Fig. 3c) . Multiple aneuploidies were worse than a single aneuploidy (Fig. 3c) , and chromosome gain were as bad as chromosome loss. We propose that the presence of extensive chromosomal aneuploidies explains the poor sporulation of the domesticated Ale and African beer clades, as sporulation genes in these strains appeared to be free of loss-of-function nucleotide variants (see below).We next probed species-wide sporulation effects from common (MAF>5%) SNPs, indels and gains and losses of genes by GWAS and identified 384 sporulation variation markers (Fig.   3d ). These were enriched (χ2, p=3.9e-05) in known sporulation genes (11%). The master regulator of meiosis, IME1, emerged as the primary sporulation determinant, with six previously unknown variants 46 associating to this trait (Supplementary fig. 3a ). Two promoter (A-325C, C-181T) and three coding (N311Y, E316V and E316G) new variants all associated with impaired sporulation (Supplementary fig. 3b ), and predominantly occurred in domesticated lineages.

Meiotic genes often carried loss-of-function variants in domesticated lineages, but rarely in wild yeasts (Fig. 3e) 

Quiescence survival is explained by population structure and local adaptation rather than domestication

An alternative life cycle strategy for yeasts encountering nutrient scarcity is to enter a quiescent G0 state 28 , which is also a complex trait that vary across genetic backgrounds 51 .We therefore probed whether domesticated isolates compensated for sporulation loss by evolving a superior quiescence life span. Encountering extreme starvation (water), wild yeasts all pursued the sporulation strategy, whereas domesticated and unclassified isolates (n=734) near uniformly entered quiescence. Quiescence survival (chronological life span; CLS) varied massively (0.5% to 96.8% survival after 20 days), but were on average much shorter than survival in the spore state. It is thus clearly an inferior survival strategy during nutrient scarcity. French Guiana and African Cocoa yeasts survived remarkably long in quiescence, while French dairy and African beer strains died rapidly. Aneu-and polyploidy .

A single aneuploidy was as bad as multiple and chromosome gains were as bad as losses. Euploid polyploids died faster than diploids (36% vs. 62% median survival after 20 days; Fig. 4a ).We next compared the quiescence survival of wild and domesticated yeasts (n=572, all euploid diploid), in carbon exhausted synthetic media in which not even wild yeast sporulates. We allowed cells to reach quiescence by exhausting sugars either using rich synthetic complete medium (SDC) or a calorie restricted such medium. After 7, 21, and 35 days we found nearly equal quiescence survival for wild and domesticated yeasts, with a small but significant advantage for domesticated yeasts in the richest environment (SDC, at days 21 and 35) that best resemble domestication niches (Fig. 4 panel B) . Rather than by domestication, survival variation under quiescence was explained by population stratification and therefore either by drift or local adaptation. Thus, wild Taiwanese and domesticated French Dairy yeasts died rapidly (<30% survivors after 7 days), while French Guiana, Mexican agave and West African Cocoa yeasts were the longest living (>60% survivors after 21 days) (Supplementary fig. 4 ). French Dairy carried loss-of-function mutations in SIC1, which is required for entry into quiescence 53 Given the high trait heritability (Fig. 4c , h 2 = from 0.77 to 0.90), we next probed alleles controlling survival under quiescence by GWAS. We identified 292 variants which were mostly (n=177) time and environment specific. Loss function mutations in the cell cycle regulator WHI2 was associated to shortened quiescence lifespan in all environments.Furthermore, 14 common (MAF>16%) variants in the minor succinate dehydrogenase (SDH1b), assisting mitochondrial electron transfer, were associated to shortened quiescence life span under all but extreme starvation. The succinate dehydrogenase complex probably controls yeast viability through its involvement in the TCA cycle and in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which must be operational to promote survival upon nutrient exhaustion [56] [57] [58] .Calorie restriction extended the quiescence lifespan for all clades, except for in the extremely long lived West African Cocoa yeasts (Supplementary Fig. 5 ).

Discussion

Domestication impairing yeast sporulation represents a truly seismic change to the biology of the organism. Firstly, loss of capacity to enter the yeast spore state, which offers long term survival when nutrients are scarce 30, 31 , leaves domesticated cells instead dependent on entering the G0 quiescence stage. Entry into quiescence also slows ageing and intrinsic death 62 , but much less so than sporulation (Fig. 2d) . Moreover, domesticated yeasts only marginally compensated for the sporulation loss by evolving extended quiescence life spans (Fig. 4b) . Domestication therefore caused a massive net drop in capacity to survive nutrient scarcity. This is likely to be detrimental in wild microhabitats, where nutrient scarcity is the rule rather than the exception for yeasts that lack motility and are unable to relocate when local nutrients are consumed. Secondly, sporulation entails transitioning from a higher to a lower ploidy state. Domesticated yeasts will have no or a much reduced capacity to achieve this shift. Because a lower ploidy state confer faster asexual reproduction in many environments 63 , this is likely to translate into a fitness cost. Third, loss of sporulation means loss of the capacity to form gametes and meiotic recombination. Recombination also occurs under yeast mitosis but at vastly lower rates 64, 65 . Thus, domestication near abolished or impaired the yeast capacity to combine beneficial variants into one genotype, to cleanse otherwise healthy genomes from deleterious mutations 66, 67 , to prevent their catastrophic accumulation through a ratchet mechanism 68 and to generate a sufficiently broad diversity of genotypes to fully exploit and adapt to multi-faceted wild niches 69 . Sexual recombination accelerates yeast adaptation 70 and the loss of sexual recombination is likely to be particularly costly in constantly changing wild niches where fast adaptation is key. Rare subclades of domesticated clades, in particular of the Wine/European lineage, are known to sometimes escape from their domestication niches and to survive as feral isolates in the wild. This is likely thanks to these strains retaining, or having re-acquired, a life cycle closer to that of wild yeast. Indeed, sporulation of feral subclades in the Wine/European clade is notably more efficient than that of other sub-clades (Supplementary fig. 2b ). Whereas purifying selection retains a functional sporulation machinery in all wild isolates, there is little doubt that non-feral domesticated strains with their impaired sporulation capacity, are strongly selected against in the wild.Because the yeast domestication syndrome is shared across genetically distinct, independently domesticated clades, it is unlikely to reflect the retention of ancestral trait that have been lost in wild lineages 71 . Instead, it likely represents convergent evolution where the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.939314 doi: bioRxiv preprint convergence was driven by domestication. Such a convergence could have both adaptive and neutral explanations. First, the domestication syndrome re-oriented both carbon and nitrogen metabolism from better respiratory to better fermentative growth. This can easily be rationalized as adaptation. Domestication niches, such as grape must with a 20% glucose/fructose content, are often rich in easily fermented sugars. Ethanol production, which is the principle trait selected for in most domestication environments, depends on efficient fermentation of these sugars. Respiration of the sugar, or of the produced ethanol, is both counterproductive to high ethanol content and discouraged by high sugar and, later, low oxygen. The better beer yeast fermentation of malt sugars to ethanol 23 , is widely held to reflect domestication driven adaptation. In contrast, concentrated sugar is relative rare in wild niches and competition for it is fierce, with concentrations unlikely to often exceed the 0.5% threshold at which sugar fermentation kicks in. In contrast to in large industrial tanks where the oxygen is rapidly depleted, oxygen is also often freely available in natural yeast niches, allowing respiration. Second, we found sporulation genes to associate to clade specific loss-of-function variants in genes private to sporulation and meiosis. This is consistent with a neutral drift model, where asexual proliferation in domestication niches relaxes selection on superfluous sporulation and meiosis genes, leaving them free to accumulate mutations. Many of these variants affected the key meiosis specific transcription factors IME1 and NDT80 that are absolutely required for sporulation 72 , underscoring that there is little selective pressure to retain sporulation intact in domesticated isolates.Sporulation requires respiration 73, 74 . Relaxed selection on sporulation may therefore indirectly lower the selection also for respiration, and this could partially account for the worse respiratory growth in domesticated lineages. Niche specific loss of superfluous genes, leading to pseudogenization and ultimately genome reduction, has been suggested to be the predominant driver of natural yeast evolution 21, 75, 76 . Domestication may simply be seen as directing and accelerating this pseudogenization process. A notable direct side-effect of relaxed selection on the sexual life cycle is that correct pairing and segregation of chromosomes during meiosis becomes irrelevant. This reduces selection against chromosomal rearrangements, aneuploidies and odd polyploidies that disturb these processes, allowing their accumulation in domesticated strains 20, 77 . This creates a knock-on effect, as their accumulation in domesticated strains reinforces the loss of the sexual cycle.Besides domestication, two events stand out in S. cerevisiae evolution since the S. paradoxus split. First, the out-of-China dispersal separated East Asian wild isolates from other yeast clades, driving the earliest and most profound genetic differentiations 20, 78, 79 .Second, hybridization of some S. cerevisiae strains to wild S. paradoxus, followed by repeated backcrossing to the S. cerevisiae parental lineage, later created S. cerevisiae genomes, such as the Alpechin clade, with massive (up to 5%) amounts of introgressed S. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.939314 doi: bioRxiv preprint paradoxus DNA 20 . Both events affect asexual growth. However, we found neither to have altered the yeast life cycle, the core organism-level property of the species. Domestication therefore stands out as the most dramatic event in yeast evolution, being unique in having reprogrammed a central aspect of its organismal biology. Fundamental consequences of domestication on life cycles are not unique to yeast: domestication made banana (Musa sp.) seedless and parthenocarpic 80 and abolished seed and flower production in garlic (Allium sativum) 81 . In contrast to these species, however, yeast is not only industrially important but serves as one of our most widely used model species. Because our understanding of yeast biology is near entirely based on studies of domesticated, or predominantly domesticated, Isolates were pre-cultivated in yeast peptone dextrose (YPD; 2% dextrose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% agar) before being diluted 1:50 into 10 mL of pre-sporulation media (YPA; 2% potassium acetate, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) and grown 48 hours at 30°C

"Abstract

Background: Febrile illness is a major burden in African children, and non-malarial causes of 45 fever are uncertain. We built and employed IDseq, a cloud-based, open access, bioinformatics 46 platform and service to identify microbes from metagenomic next-generation sequencing of 47 tissue samples. In this pilot study, we evaluated blood, nasopharyngeal, and stool specimens 48 from 94 children (aged 2-54 months) with febrile illness admitted to Tororo District Hospital, 49Uganda. 50 51 Results: The most common pathogens identified were Plasmodium falciparum (51.1% of 52 samples) and parvovirus B19 (4.4%) from blood; human rhinoviruses A and C (40%), 53 respiratory syncytial virus (10%), and human herpesvirus 5 (10%) from nasopharyngeal swabs; 54 and rotavirus A (50% of those with diarrhea) from stool. Among other potential pathogens, we 55 identified one novel orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, from the blood of a 56 child diagnosed with malaria and pneumonia, and Bwamba orthobunyavirus in the nasopharynx 57 of a child with rash and sepsis. We also identified two novel human rhinovirus C species. 58 59 Conclusions: This exploratory pilot study demonstrates the utility of mNGS and the IDseq 60 platform for defining the molecular landscape of febrile infectious diseases in resource limited 61 areas. These methods, supported by a robust data analysis and sharing platform, offer a new tool 62 for the surveillance, diagnosis, and ultimately treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. 63To address these challenges, we developed IDseq, a cloud-based open-source 90 bioinformatics platform and service for detection of microbial pathogens from metagenomic 91 next-generation sequencing (mNGS) data. IDseq requires minimal computational hardware and 92 is designed to enhance accessibility and build informatics capacity in resource limited regions. 93Here, we leveraged IDseq and mNGS data to perform an exploratory proof-of-concept molecular 94 survey of febrile children in rural Uganda to characterize pathogens associated with fever, 95 including both well-recognized and novel causes of illness. 96 97 Analyses/Results 98

","Introduction 67

The evaluation of children with fever is challenging, particularly in the developing world. Within the species rhinovirus, we assembled de novo a total of 13 HRV-C (mean 198 coverage: 39-fold) and 13 HRV-A (mean coverage: 268-fold) genomes (> 500 bp (Figure 4) ). Of 199 these, 10 HRV-A and 9 HRV-C genomes had complete coverage of the VP1 region, which is 200 used to define enterovirus types [19] . HRV types are defined by divergence of >73% in the VP1 201 gene. As such, we found three HRV-A and eight HRV-C types in this cohort. One individual 202 harbored two distinct HRV-A types (genome pairwise identity=75.3%, VP1 pairwise 203 identity=67.1%). Additionally, we assembled two novel HRV-C isolates from two patients 204 admitted with gastroenteritis (patient ID: EOFI-014), and pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea 205 Using mNGS and IDseq, the most common pathogen identified in the blood of febrile 264Ugandan children was P. falciparum, an expected result considering the high incidence of 265 malaria in Tororo District at the time of this study [33] . Some discrepancies were seen compared 266 to blood smear readings, with false positive smears probably due to errors in slide reading, a 267 common problem in African clinics [34] , and false negative smears due to the expected greater 268 sensitivity of mNGS for identification of P. falciparum. In children with only sub-microscopic 269 parasitemia, it is uncertain whether fevers can be ascribed to malaria, and in fact many children 270 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Three children had genotypic 318 evidence of ESBL producing organisms predicted to be resistant to ceftriaxone, a frontline 319 antibiotic for severe infections in this region [53] . In addition, one of these three children carried 320 IMP-1, which also confers resistance to carbapenems, a class of antibiotics reserved for the most 321 resistant infections. 322 323 Our exploratory pilot study had important limitations. First, our samples were not 324 collected randomly, but rather were a convenience sample due to the logistical constraints of our 325 small clinical study; as such the results should not be seen as broadly representative of pathogens 326infecting Ugandan children. In particular, the lack of identification of bacteremia in study 327 subjects may have been due to a relative paucity of severe illness, compared to that in other 328 studies, in our cohort of admitted children. Second, clinical evaluation of children followed the 329 standards of a rural African hospital, so diagnostic evaluation was limited to physical 330 examination and malaria blood smears. Much more may be learned by linking rigorous clinical 331 evaluation with mNGS results, and thereby more comprehensively assessing associations 332 between clinical syndromes and specific pathogens.

Background & Aims

","Background & Aims

The coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been characterized as a pandemic, which causes a serious public health challenge in the world. A very large group of patients infected by HBV has been reported worldwide, especially in China. In order to answer whether specific treatment strategy on the patients coinfected with HBV and SARS-CoV-2, it requires profound understanding of the clinical characteristics on those patients. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HBV patients remain largely unknown.

Approach & Results

In this retrospective investigation, we included 123 COVID-19 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 5 to March 7, 2020. All enrolled patients are the laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases according to the criteria reported previously. A total of 123 patients were analyzed for their Clinical records, laboratory results including the diagnosis of HBV infection and liver function. Among 123 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 51 years old and 59.3% were females (73/123). Fifteen were previously HBV infected patients, 66.7% of them were males (10/15), patients with HBV infection appeared to have a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis and an increased level of total bilirubin. Seven (46.7%) patients with HBV infection were defined as severe cases, while the severity rate was 24.1% for the patients without HBV infection (26/108). The mortality of patients with HBV infection was 13.3% (2/15) compared to 2.8% (3/108) for the patients without HBV infection..

The virus was spreading rapidly to other cities of China and accumulating cases had been reported in coming days(1). According to the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO), the disease has been officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) (2). The etiology of the disease was identified to be a novel β-coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on the phylogenetic relationship with SARS-CoV. On March 11, 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic. So far, more than 290,000 people in over 180 countries or territories have reported COVID-19 cases, and more than 12,000 people have died according to data from WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).Around 25% COVID-19 cases were reported in Wuhan, China.In addition to the recent emerged SARS-CoV-2, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the viruses which causes a global infection and threat public health. In worldwide, the prevalence of HBsAg is about 3.9%. As high as 290 million patients are suffering from chronic HBV infection and about 650,000 patients die from HBV infection due to liver failure, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) each year(3, 4).According to a nationwide epidemiological survey of population whose ages range from 1 to 59y in China, 2016, the prevalence of HBsAg was 7.2%. Around 93 million patients were positive for HBV infection and 20 million patients were diagnosed as chronic hepatitis B infection(5, 6).Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a capacity to infect multiply organs including upper respiratory tract, lung, kidney probably due to the expression of SRAS-CoV-2 receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), on these .

A recent research has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with live function damage in . Taking consideration of large group of people with HBV infection, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with HBV infection requires a further assessment in order to design the specific treatment strategy. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HBV patients are still not clear. For example, we do not yet know whether the SARS-CoV-2 infection is more severe in HBV patients and we also do not have much knowledge about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the course of HBV infection. In this retrospective study, we discovered that the liver impairment is a common feature in COVID-19 patients and as high as 46.7% patients with HBV infection develop to severe situation during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests that patients with HBV infection might be vulnerable group to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Study design

From January 5 to February 7, 2020, 123 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the study. Informed consents were obtained from all patients upon admission to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. The clinical outcomes (ie, discharges, mortality, Hospital stays) were monitored up to March 7, 2020, the final date of follow-up.

Baseline characteristics of COVID-19 patients with or without HBV infection

A total of 123 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 50 males and 73 females. Around 12.2% (15/123) of patients are also suffering from HBV infection. Males take up 66.7% (10/15) of patients coinfected by HBV and SARS-CoV-2 and seems to have a higher coinfection rate compared to females (p=0.0469, Table 1 ). The median age of total enrolled patients was 51.0 years (IQR, 35.0-66.0; range, 20-96 years). The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were: fever (37.4-39.1 o C, 69.1%), fatigue (54.5%), cough (50.4%), myalgia (32.5%), and less common: dyspnea (21.1%), Headache (16.3%) and diarrhea (17.1%). Among the 123 patients, thirty-five (28.5%) cases had underlying at least one comorbidity such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, malignancy, COPD and liver cirrhosis. Patients with HBV infection had a higher rate of liver cirrhosis (p=0.0390, Table 1 ). Seven of 15 patients (46.7%) with HBV infection develop to the severe situation, while the percentage of severe cases is much less (24.1%) in the COVID-19 patients without HBV infection..

Seventy-four patients were given antiviral (arbidol, orally, 200 mg, three times per day), and 74 with oxygen support. Antibiotic therapy, both orally and intravenous, were given as described in Table 1 . Sixty-one patients received corticosteroids to suppress an excessive inflammatory activation. There is no significant difference of treatment between patients with or without HBV infection.

laboratory Findings of COVID-19 patients with or without HBV infection at baseline

The biochemical tests included measuring the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin as well as recording prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, d-dimer and creatinine. All of these biochemical features were found normal; however, the level of total bilirubin was higher in patients with HBV infection (p=0.0178, Table 2 ). The blood counts of the patients with or without HBV infection showed lymphopenia (< 1.3 ×10 9 /L).

Fifteen COVID-19 patients were examined to be HBsAg positive (5 females and 10 males). The data of anti-HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBeAg and anti-HBcAg were available for 11 patients with ten patients HBeAg negtive and one positive. The value .

The HBV-DNA level of 10 patients are more than 20 IU/ml (Table S1) .

Clinical outcome

We observed the clinical outcome of 123 COVID-19 patients within 31 days of treatment. Eleven patients (73.4%) with HBV infection and 99 patients (91.6%) without HBV infection were discharged from the hospital according to the guideline.Two patients (13.3%) with HBV infection and 6 patients (5.6%) without HBV infection were still hospitalized. Two patients (13.3%) with HBV infection and 3 patients (2.8%) without HBV infection were dead. Patients with HBV infection showed higher mortality rate compared to those COVID-19 patients without HBV infection (13.3%vs 2.8%, Table 2 ).

Discussion

Resemble to the other two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause patients severe respiratory symptoms and even leads to death with average mortality rate of 3.4% (according to the data reported from WHO) though most cases of COVID-19 are acute and resolve fast. Liver damage has been identified in around 60% of patients suffering from SARS and viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in liver tissue(10), which providing the evidence that SARS-CoV involved in liver injure.Liver impairment has been also reported in MERS patients(11). According to the clinical reports from different centers with large scale of COVID-19 cases, SARS-.

Our study is in line with previous observations. We found in COVID-19 cases without HBV infection that about 50.9% (55/108) patients have the dysfunction of liver symptoms by measuring the level of ALT, AST, TBIL, GGT, and ALP during the disease progress. In our enrolled cases, we also discovered that there is higher incidence of abnormal liver function (81.8%, 27/33) in severe COVID-19 patients than did in mild cases (43.3%, 39/90, data not shown), which agrees with the study that lower incidence of AST abnormality was found in the cases diagnosed by CT scan on the subclinical stage than in the COVID-19 patients who were confirmed after onset of symptom(15). Therefore, liver function could be considered as one factor to indicate the progress of COVID-19.According to other study from 1099 cases, around 23.7% of confirmed patients have at least one comorbidity(13). Among these pre-existing chronic diseases, abnormal liver function is one of most common features in COVID-19 patients and severe patients are more likely to have HBV infection. In our research, about one out of five (7/33, 21.8%) COVID-19 severe patients were found to coinfect with HBV infection. It has been suggested that liver impairment in COVID-19 patients could be due to the virus direct attack or resulted by other causes such as drug toxicity and systemic inflammation(18). To detect the viral RNA and viral particles from liver biopsies of COVID-19 patients will be helpful to elucidate if virus infect liver tissue.Our results pointed out that as high as around 50% (7/15) of HBV patients were identified as severe COVID-19 cases. It is more likely that HBV patients will suffer .

In our enrolled cases, two patients with SARS-CoV and HBV coinfection died on admission. One patient died from severe liver disease, haptic sclerosis. And the other died from intestinal hemorrhage, which seems to be associated the impairment of gastrointestinal tract. More coinfection cases analysis are required to further understand whether SARS-CoV-2 infection aggerates the progress of pre-existing disease and thereby cause death. There are different phases for HBV chronic infection including immunotolerant, viral suppression under longterm treatment with nucleotide analogues. In our current study, we collected the data of HBV on 15 coinfection patients at one time point, which were mainly used to identify HBV infection. More coinfection cases analysis is required to provide further evidences for evaluating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on active HBV replication and live impairment at different time points for the HBV patients in different phases.In conclusion, by respectively analyzing the patients with coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and HBV, we found that the patients with pre-existing HBV infection will be much more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, HBV patients should be given the specific protection.

"Abstract

Cylindrical protein scaffolds are thought to stabilize membrane tubules, preventing membrane fission. In contrast, Snead et al. find that when scaffold proteins assemble, bulky disordered domains within them become acutely concentrated, generating steric pressure that destabilizes tubules, driving fission.Cellular membranes are continuously remodeled. The crescent-shaped bin-amphiphysinrvs (BAR) domains remodel membranes in multiple cellular pathways. Based on studies of BAR domains in isolation, the current paradigm is that they polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds that stabilize lipid tubules, preventing membrane fission. But in nature BAR domains are often part of multi-domain proteins that contain large intrinsically-disordered regions. Using in vitro and live cell assays, here we show that full-length BAR domaincontaining proteins, rather than stabilizing membrane tubules, are instead surprisingly potent drivers of membrane fission. Specifically, when BAR scaffolds assemble at membrane surfaces, their bulky disordered domains become crowded, generating steric pressure that destabilizes lipid tubules. More broadly, we observe this behavior with BAR domains that have a range of curvatures. These data challenge the idea that cellular membranes adopt the curvature of BAR scaffolds, suggesting instead that the ability to concentrate disordered domains is the key requirement for membrane remodeling and fission by BAR domain-containing proteins.All rights reserved.

","Introduction

Cellular membranes must undergo dynamic remodeling to facilitate essential cellular processes including formation of trafficking vesicles (Conner and Schmid, 2003) , viral egress (Hurley et al., 2010) , and cytokinesis (Mierzwa and Gerlich, 2014) . Since membranes resist deformation (Helfrich, 1973) , cells employ specialized protein machines to drive membrane remodeling (Zimmerberg and Kozlov, 2006) . For example, the crescent-shaped, dimeric bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domains Simunovic et al., 2015) polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds on membrane surfaces, forcing the underlying membrane to adopt the tubular geometry of the scaffold (Adam et al., 2015; Frost et al., 2008; . This rigid scaffold is thought to stabilize membrane tubules, preventing their division into separate membrane compartments through the process of membrane fission (Boucrot et al., 2012) .Importantly, most studies on the membrane shaping behavior of BAR domains have examined the BAR domain in isolation, with significant portions of the protein removed. Examples include the N-terminal amphipathic helix BAR (N-BAR) domain of amphiphysin (Peter et al., 2004) , the FCH BAR (F-BAR) domain of FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2010; Henne et al., 2007) , the F-BAR domain of the neuronal migration protein srGAP2 (Guerrier et al., 2009) , the F-BAR domains of the cytokinesis proteins Imp2 (McDonald et al., 2016) and Cdc15 (McDonald et al., 2015) , and the inverted BAR (I-BAR) domains of MIM and ABBA (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009 ), among others. These results have provided critical insight into the detailed geometry of BAR domain arrangement at membrane surfaces, helping to elucidate their mechanisms of membrane curvature sensing and induction. However, BAR domains do not typically exist in isolation in the cell, but rather as part of large, multi-domain proteins which also frequently contain long, intrinsically-disordered protein (IDP) domains of several hundred amino acids (Henne et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2007; Miele et al., 2004; Wuertenberger and Groemping, 2015) . How might these disordered domains influence the membrane remodeling behavior of BAR domains? cells -what brings bulky domains together to generate steric pressure? In particular, what keeps crowded proteins from simply diffusing away from one another, dissipating steric pressure and inhibiting membrane shaping? Proteins such as amphiphysin (Miele et al., 2004; Peter et al., 2004) and FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2010; Henne et al., 2007) , which contain both scaffold-forming BAR domains and bulky disordered domains, present a possible solution to this problem. Specifically, the ability of BAR domains to form scaffolds has the potential to locally concentrate disordered domains such that steric pressure is amplified rather than dissipated.Therefore, we set out to investigate the impact of disordered domains on the membrane remodeling ability of BAR proteins. To our surprise, we found that while isolated BAR domains formed stable membrane tubules, full-length amphiphysin and FCHo1 destabilized these tubules, leading to highly efficient membrane fission. These results challenge the paradigm that BAR scaffolds stabilize membrane tubes, and suggest instead that they act as templates that locally amplify steric pressure among disordered domains, leading to membrane fission.

While the amphiphysin N-BAR domain stabilizes membrane tubules, full-length amphiphysin drives membrane fission.

Amphiphysin is composed of an N-terminal, amphipathic helix BAR (N-BAR) domain, followed by an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) domain of approximately 383 amino acids in humans, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (Miele et al., 2004; Owen et al., 2004; Owen et al., 1998; Peter et al., 2004) (Fig. 1A) . To compare membrane bending by fulllength amphiphysin (Amph-FL) to the N-BAR domain alone, we first examined the effects of each protein on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). These experiments revealed that both the N-BAR domain and Amph-FL drove potent membrane bending, forming mobile, diffraction-limited tubules that extended from the GUV surface (Fig. S1A , Movies S1 and S2). These GUVs often collapsed or broke apart into smaller tubules and fragments (Movies S3 and S4), suggesting that lipid tubule formation may not have been the endpoint of the membrane remodeling process.To directly visualize the morphology of membranes at the end of remodeling, we utilized negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to resolve membrane structures below the optical diffraction limit. As expected from previous findings (Gallop et al., 2006; Peter et al., 2004) , the N-BAR domain transformed vesicles that had an average initial diameter of 200 nm into long tubules with average outer diameter 44±6 nm s.d. (Fig. 1B ,C and S1B,C). In contrast, Amph-FL did not drive appreciable membrane tubule formation in TEM experiments. Rather, Amph-FL divided the vesicles of initially 200 nm diameter into a population of highly curved vesicles with a peak diameter centered near 22 nm (Fig. 1D,E and S1D). This result suggests that Amph-FL is capable of driving membrane fission, a more energetically demanding process than membrane tubule formation (Campelo et al., 2012) .

Full-length amphiphysin generates highly curved fission products.

To better understand the ability of amphiphysin to drive membrane fission, we compared N-BAR and Amph-FL in two additional assays of membrane fission. In the first of these experiments, we used supported bilayers with extra membrane reservoir (SUPER templates), which are glass beads surrounded by a low-tension membrane. Exposure of SUPER templates to fission-driving proteins results in measurable membrane release from the beads Pucadyil and Schmid, 2008) . SUPER template experiments revealed that while both N-BAR and Amph-FL drove membrane release in the concentration range of 50-1,000 nM, Amph-FL drove more than twice as much (2.6 to 4.7-fold greater) membrane release at each concentration (Fig. 1F) . Notably, membrane release does not directly imply efficient membrane fission, as both vesicles and lipid tubules can be shed from SUPER templates. Therefore, we next employed a tethered vesicle assay to quantify the distributions of fission vesicle diameters over a range of protein concentrations (Snead et al., 2017) . Specifically, we tethered fluorescent vesicles to a coverslip passivated with PEG and PEG-biotin ( Fig. 2A) . Vesicles in these experiments contained a biotinylated lipid, which facilitated tethering to the substrate via binding to neutravidin. Vesicles also contained the fluorescent lipid Oregon Green 488-DHPE, which we used to quantify the brightness of each vesicle after imaging in confocal fluorescence microscopy (Aguet et al., 2013) (Fig. 2B ). We then converted the resulting distributions of vesicle brightness to approximate distributions of vesicle diameter by calibrating against the initial vesicle diameter distribution measured using dynamic light scattering (see methods).Using this assay, we found that Amph-FL in the concentration range of 50-150 nM transformed vesicles with an average initial diameter of 200 nm (Fig. 2B ,C) to a population of high curvature fission products (Fig. 2B ,D) with a median diameter of 22 nm at 150 nM, in agreement with results from TEM ( Fig. 1D ,E). The proportion of vesicles that fell within the high curvature group (diameters below approximately 45 nm) increased with increasing protein concentration, from less than 1% at 50 nM to approximately 38% at 150 nM (Fig. 2F ). In contrast, the N-BAR domain did not drive fission, even at higher protein concentrations (Fig. 2B , E, and F). While lipid tubules were not apparent in tethered vesicle experiments with N-BAR (Fig. 2B ), tubules were observed at micromolar N-BAR concentrations (Fig. S1E) , consistent with the tubules formed in TEM experiments (Fig. 1C) . Notably, higher concentrations of Amph-FL were required to observe fission in TEM experiments compared to tethered vesicle experiments. This increase is due to the high lipid concentration used in TEM experiments (approximately 100-fold greater than tethered vesicle experiments), which is necessary to achieve an adequate density of lipid structures for TEM (see methods). Taken together, our results from electron microscopy and tethered vesicle experiments confirm that Amph-FL is a potent driver of membrane fission, while the isolated N-BAR domain is only capable of forming membrane tubules. Full-length amphiphysin produces highly curved fission products. Tethered vesicle composition: 76 mol% DOPC, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, 2 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE, 2 mol% DP-EG10-biotin.

FCS experiments also showed that the size of Amph CTD ∆SH3 varied with the concentration of monovalent salt in the buffer (Fig. S2J) , consistent with the known sensitivity of highly-charged disordered proteins to changes in ionic strength (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . We next performed tethered vesicle experiments to assess membrane fission by Amph CTD ∆SH3. The protein included an N-terminal hexa-histidine (6his) tag to facilitate binding to membranes by the lipid DOGS-NTA-Ni (Fig. 3A) . Experiments revealed that Amph CTD ∆SH3 indeed drove the formation of highly curved fission products (Fig. 3B,C) . However, 100-fold greater concentration of Amph CTD ∆SH3 in solution (10 µM) was required to generate fission products of similar curvature to those observed with Amph-FL (100 nM) (see Fig. 2D ,F).Membrane binding experiments with fluorescently-labeled Amph CTD ∆SH3 showed that when 10 µM of protein was present in solution, the protein covered approximately 40% of the membrane surface . At this coverage, steric pressure from protein crowding is expected to be sufficient to overcome the energetic barrier to membrane fission (Snead et al., 2017) . Therefore, the requirement for a high solution concentration of Amph CTD ∆SH3 reflects the conditions necessary to promote crowded binding to the membrane surface. In contrast, the ability of Amph-FL to drive fission at much lower concentrations likely arises from polymerization of the BAR domain scaffold, which enables multivalent membrane binding (Simunovic et al., 2016; Sorre et al., 2012) . In line with this thinking, we found that 100 nM Amph-FL, a concentration which drove potent fission (Fig. 2D ,F), covered greater than 70% of the membrane surface (Fig. S2F ). This coverage is significantly higher than has been observed for non-assembling proteins (Feder, 1980; Snead et al., 2017) . Collectively, these results suggest that the ability of amphiphysin to drive efficient membrane fission arises from a collaboration between its N-BAR domain and disordered domain. respectively) as well as hydrodynamic radius . Tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that N-BAR-epsin CTD generated highly curved fission products from vesicles with an initial average diameter of 200 nm within a similar range of protein concentrations to Amph-FL (Fig. 3F , compare to Fig. 2D ). Further, both N-BAR-epsin CTD and Amph-FL produced a very similar fraction of fission products with diameters below 45 nm at equivalent concentrations in solution (Fig. 3G) . Finally, SUPER template membrane shedding experiments revealed that in the concentration range of 50-1,000 nM, N-BAR-epsin CTD drove greater membrane release compared to the isolated N-BAR domain (Fig. 3H) , similar to the results of SUPER template experiments comparing N-BAR and Amph-FL (Fig. 1F ). These findings illustrate the ability of N-BAR scaffolds to promote membrane fission by crowding arbitrary disordered domains at membrane surfaces.How does crowding among disordered domains overcome the ability of BAR scaffolds to stabilize lipid tubules? One explanation is that steric pressure among the bulky disordered domains of Amph-FL inhibits the assembly of a long-range N-BAR scaffold, which, if allowed to form, would inhibit fission. In support of this hypothesis, when Amph-FL reached over 70% surface coverage as described above (Fig. S2F) , the underlying N-BAR domain covered only about 16% of the membrane, based on membrane footprints for Amph-FL and N-BAR of 79 and 16.5 nm 2 per monomer, respectively (see methods). This coverage is significantly lower than expected for a fully-assembled N-BAR scaffold, which approaches complete coverage (Adam et al., 2015; . Furthermore, the volume available per amphiphysin disordered domain above the N-BAR scaffold is only about 50% of the volume that each domain would be expected to occupy in solution, based on its radius of gyration (Fig. 3I , see calculation in methods). Therefore, the disordered domains would be required to compress substantially to fit around a fullyassembled N-BAR scaffold. Previous work has shown that substantial compression of disordered domains is energetically costly, likely exceeding the cost of membrane deformation . Collectively, these arguments suggest that the presence of amphiphysin's bulky disordered domains inhibits assembly of long-range N-BAR scaffolds.Interestingly, previous structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy have reported limited observations of tubular N-BAR scaffolds formed from full-length amphiphysin (Adam et al., 2015; . These structures have been observed on membrane substrates containing a majority of negatively-charged lipids, which are thought to provide a strong electrostatic driving force for scaffold assembly (Adam et al., 2015; . Therefore, we performed tethered vesicle fission experiments using a similar membrane composition (Fig. S3) . Here, the onset of membrane fission occurred at somewhat higher Amph-FL concentration, 350 nM ( Fig. S3 ) in comparison to 75 nM ( Fig.  2B -F). These results demonstrate that high concentrations of negatively charged lipids cannot prevent membrane fission as protein concentration increases. Indeed, the cryoelectron microscopy studies cited above suggest that long-range scaffolds assembled from full-length protein were more rare . Moreover, these studies employed buffers that lacked small monovalent ions (Adam et al., 2015; , conditions known to favor extension of disordered domains owing to reduced electrostatic screening (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . This environment likely enabled the disordered domains to pack more efficiently around the scaffold, in line with the needle-like densities seen protruding from the N-BAR scaffold (Adam et al., 2015) .All rights reserved.

Disordered domains inhibit tubule formation by BAR scaffolds in live cells.

We next sought to evaluate the influence of disordered domains on the membrane remodeling behavior of BAR domains in live mammalian cells. Multiple previous studies have established that overexpression of BAR domains leads to formation of lipid tubules in the cytosol that are coated by BAR scaffolds (Boucrot et al., 2012; Frost et al., 2008; McDonald et al., 2015; Peter et al., 2004) . We first replicated these findings by overexpressing the N-BAR domain of human amphiphysin tagged with mCherry ( Fig. 4A ) in retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells. We found that N-BAR generated a dense network of tubules inside the cells (Fig. 4B ), in agreement with previous findings (Peter et al., 2004) . The number of tubules per cell increased with the expression level of N-BAR (Fig. 4C) , and co-localized with a plasma membrane stain (Fig. S4A) , indicating that many of the tubules originated from the plasma membrane as previously observed (McDonald et al., 2015; McDonald et al., 2016) . In contrast, overexpression of Amph-FL tagged with mCherry ( Fig. 4A ) led to significantly fewer tubules per cell compared to N-BAR ( Fig. 4 B-D), suggesting that the disordered domain of Amph-FL inhibited tubule formation. Notably, Amph-FL interacts with the clathrin adaptor network and may therefore recruit other membrane remodeling proteins. As such, it is unclear whether the lack of stable All rights reserved.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we created a chimera of N-BAR fused to an alternative disordered domain, from the neuronal protein neurofilament-M (N-BAR-NfM CTD), tagged with mCherry (Fig. 4A) . The disordered C-terminal domain of neurofilament-M acts as an entropic brush, radiating outward along the length of neurofilaments and sterically repelling neighboring disordered domains to control axon diameter (Brown and Hoh, 1997; Kumar et al., 2002) . The neurofilament-M disordered domain is similar in length to that of amphiphysin (438 versus 383 amino acids, respectively) but is not involved in endocytosis and therefore contains no binding domains for endocytic proteins. Overexpressing N-BAR-NfM CTD in RPE cells resulted in a similar phenotype to Amph-FL, in which the number of tubules per cell was significantly reduced compared to the isolated N-BAR domain (Fig. 4 B-D) . Furthermore, while tubules in N-BAR-expressing cells had an average length of 6.0±0.2 µm s.e.m., tubule lengths in cells expressing Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD were significantly shorter, 3.5±0.1 and 3.6±0.1 µm s.e.m., respectively (Fig. 4E ).Time-lapse imaging of live cells revealed that the tubules formed by Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD were more transient in comparison to isolated N-BAR ( Fig. 4F and Movie S5). Specifically, the tubules in cells expressing N-BAR had an average lifetime of approximately 75±5 s s.e.m., whereas tubule lifetime was significantly shorter in cells expressing Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD, approximately 29±3 and 35±4 s s.e.m., respectively (Fig. 4F ). The tubules formed by N-BAR also had greater fluorescence intensity in the protein channel relative to the local background in comparison to Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD (Fig. S4B ,C). This finding indicates that the disordered domains of Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD did not promote tubule fission by enhancing protein binding to the membrane surface. Collectively, results from experiments in live cells indicate that bulky disordered domains are capable of disrupting the formation of stable tubules scaffolded by BAR domains, similar to observations in vitro ( Fig. 1C ,D). The disordered domains may have inhibited tubule formation by driving membrane fission, though future work is needed to test the role of disordered domains in physiological fission events.All rights reserved.

Crowding among disordered domains opposes the ability of I-BAR scaffolds to drive inward membrane bending.

We next asked how the membrane remodeling ability of crowded disordered domains compares with that of BAR scaffolds. To make this comparison, we created a chimeric protein that places the two mechanisms in direct competition within the same molecule. Specifically, we fused the inverted BAR (I-BAR) domain of human IRSp53 to the bulky, C-terminal disordered domain of rat AP180 (569 disordered amino acids) to form I-BAR-AP180 CTD (Fig. 5A ). While the I-BAR domain is known to generate inverted membrane curvature (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009) , the attached disordered domains should generate steric pressure that will tend to bend the membrane in the opposite direction. Exposing GUVs to the I-BAR domain alone drove inverted membrane tubulation, as expected (Fig. 5B , left and Movie S6). In contrast, the I-BAR-AP180 CTD chimera drove neither inward nor outward tubulation. Instead, the protein caused the GUV membrane to fluctuate dynamically through non-spherical shapes in which regions of gentle membrane curvature extending both inward and outward were apparent, (Fig. 5B , right and Movie S7). These ""frustrated"" fluctuations demonstrate that the disordered domain effectively neutralized the ability of the I-BAR domain to drive inward membrane bending. This result suggests that crowding among disordered domains and scaffolding by BAR domains make comparable contributions to membrane remodeling.Membrane release experiments using SUPER templates showed that exposure to the I-BAR domain (100 nM -5 µM) decreased the amount of membrane shedding to levels lower than the amount of non-specific shedding that occurred in protein-free buffer (Fig.  5C , negative values). This result suggests that assembly of the I-BAR scaffold stabilized the membrane against shedding. In contrast, I-BAR-AP180 CTD drove positive membrane release at all concentrations ( Fig. 5C) , demonstrating that the disordered domain of AP180 is capable of disrupting the membrane-stabilizing effect of I-BAR. Interestingly, tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that the highest concentration All rights reserved.

This result demonstrates that, under appropriate conditions, steric pressure among crowded disordered domains is sufficient to overcome the structure-based curvature preference of the I-BAR scaffold. Importantly, while wild-type IRSp53 does not naturally contain a large disordered domain, the I-BAR domain-containing proteins MIM and ABBA do contain regions of substantial disorder (approximately 475 amino acids in MIM) (Lee et al., 2007) . Therefore, our observations raise the question of whether the presumed role of these proteins in driving cellular membrane protrusions can be justified on the basis of in vitro studies of their isolated I-BAR domains (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009 ).

An F-BAR scaffold drives fission by locally crowding bulky disordered domains.

If BAR scaffolds drive membrane fission by concentrating large disordered domains at membrane surfaces, then the ability of Amph-FL to drive fission (Figs. 1 and 2) should extend to other proteins that contain both BAR domains and substantial regions of intrinsic disorder. Interestingly, many proteins that contain the modestly-curved F-BAR domain also have this architecture (Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2010), including the endocytic proteins FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2010) and its yeast homolog Syp1 (Reider et al., 2009) , the srGAP proteins involved in neuronal development (Wuertenberger and Groemping, 2015) , and the cytokinesis proteins Cdc15 and Imp2 (McDonald et al., 2016) in S. pombe and Hof1 (Meitinger et al., 2011) in S. cerevisiae. To test this idea, we examined FCHo1 (C. elegans), which consists of an Nterminal F-BAR domain followed by an intrinsically disordered domain of 412 amino acids and a C-terminal µ-homology domain (Henne et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2016; Umasankar et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016) (Fig. 5E ). Negative stain TEM revealed that exposure of vesicles with an initial average diameter of 200 nm to the F-BAR domain of FCHo1 drove formation of lipid tubules with an average diameter of 21±2 nm s.d. (Fig. 5F ,G and S5A,B), in agreement with previous findings (Henne et al., 2010; Henne et al., 2007) . In contrast, full-length FCHo1 (FCHo1-FL) did not generate lipid tubules, but instead divided the 200 nm diameter vesicles into a population of highly curved vesicles with average diameter 17±7 nm s.d. (Fig. 5H and S5C,D) .Similarly, tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that FCHo1-FL drove potent membrane fission over the concentration range of 10-250 nM (Fig. 5I,K) , a comparable range to Amph-FL (50-150 nM, Fig. 2D ,F), with a mean diameter of 19±1 nm s.e.m. at 250 nM of FCHo1-FL. However, the F-BAR domain alone did not drive fission in these experiments, even at substantially higher concentrations up to 2 µM (Fig. 5J,K) . Interestingly, in both tethered vesicle and TEM experiments, the fission products produced by FCHo1-FL had a peak diameter of slightly less than 20 nm, with some vesicles as small as 10 nm. These small diameters suggest that FCHo1-FL may stabilize All rights reserved.

Notably, vesicles in these experiments were composed primarily of the lipid DOPC, which has a lower bending rigidity than physiological membranes (Dimova, 2014) . In contrast, when we increased bilayer rigidity by replacing DOPC with the substantially more rigid, fully-saturated lipid DPPC (Dimova, 2014; Lee et al., 2001) , the average diameter of fission products increased to approximately 50 nm at 50 nM of FCHo1-FL, consistent with bilayer vesicles (Fig. S5E-G) . Collectively, these studies show that, despite their gentle curvature, F-BAR scaffolds are also capable of collaborating with disordered domain crowding to drive efficient membrane fission, producing highly curved vesicles. These findings suggest that the ability of BAR domains to assemble into scaffolds that concentrate disordered domains, regardless of their intrinsic structural curvature, is the key requirement for membrane fission.All rights reserved.

Discussion

Here we report that membrane scaffolding by BAR domains works synergistically with steric pressure among bulky disordered domains to drive membrane fission. By highlighting the ability of BAR scaffolds to locally concentrate disordered domains, this work helps to explain how steric pressure can be generated and locally sustained at membrane surfaces. Further, our findings are in contrast with the established view that BAR scaffolds prevent fission by stabilizing membrane tubes (Boucrot et al., 2012) . Instead, our work suggests that BAR proteins that contain substantial disordered regions are more likely to be drivers of membrane fission. In support of this idea, previous work showed that the yeast amphiphysins Rvs161/167 are essential for membrane fission, and deletion of these proteins leads to a defect in the entry of clathrin-coated pits into cells (Kaksonen et al., 2005; Kishimoto et al., 2011) . Depletion of amphiphysin by RNA interference also dramatically inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells (Meinecke et al., 2013) , although this endocytic defect has been attributed to a reduction in dynamin recruitment.Our finding that modestly-curved F-BAR domains can also collaborate with bulky disordered domains to drive potent fission is surprising, as it suggests that proteins such as FCHo1/2 may participate in membrane shaping throughout the maturation of clathrincoated pits, and may even help drive the final fission event. This hypothesis is in contrast to the idea that FCHo1/2 are primarily involved in the initiation of clathrin-coated pits All rights reserved.

However, previous work showed that FCHo2 is present throughout the lifetime of clathrin-coated pits (Taylor et al., 2011) , supporting the possible role of FCHo2 in membrane shaping. Moreover, many F-BAR proteins involved in other cellular pathways such as cytokinesis also contain large regions of intrinsic disorder (McDonald et al., 2016; Meitinger et al., 2011; . As such, our findings raise the question of whether F-BAR scaffolds facilitate membrane fission in a variety of contexts beyond membrane traffic.More broadly, our work raises the possibility that protein assemblies beyond BAR domains may serve as scaffolds for crowding bulky disordered domains in order to ensure efficient membrane fission. One potential example is dynamin, a scaffold-forming GTPase involved in fission of clathrin-coated pits (Antonny et al., 2016) . While dynamin itself does not contain substantial regions of disorder, it assembles with proteins that contain such domains, including amphiphysin and SNX9 (Daumke et al., 2014) . Once recruited by dynamin, these proteins may generate significant steric pressure at membrane necks. In line with this thinking, previous in vitro studies found that amphiphysin acts synergistically with dynamin to enhance membrane fission (Meinecke et al., 2013; . Moreover, the yeast dynamin homolog, Vps1, is dispensable for fission, but is necessary for proper localization and accumulation of amphiphysin at clathrincoated pits (Kaksonen et al., 2005; Smaczynska-de Rooij et al., 2010) . A function of Vps1 could therefore be to organize and concentrate bulky disordered domains at membrane necks to promote fission.Recent work has revealed that BAR domains also promote membrane fission by acting as a diffusion barrier to lipids (Renard et al., 2015; Simunovic et"

Background: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan City, China, at the end of 2019 and has caused an outbreak of human-to-human

","Introduction

In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and epidemiologically linked to a seafood wholesale market [1, 2] . It has been determined that the pathogen causing the viral pneumonia among affected individuals is a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1, 3] . The pathogen exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility and has spread rapidly within and beyond Wuhan city [4, 5] . On January 30 th , 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [6] .Wuhan is central China's transportation hub with a population of 11 million residents and a large number of higher-education students (~1.3 million in 89 universities and colleges), a particularly mobile population [7] . Beyond these factors, viral spread was likely exacerbated further by the surge in domestic and international travel during the 40-day Lunar New Year (LNY) celebrations (from January 10 th , 2020 to February 18 th , 2020) -the largest annual human migration in the world, comprised of hundreds of millions of people travelling across the country. As of February 4 th , 2020, China has reported 20,530 confirmed cases and 23,314 suspected cases with 2019-nCoV infections [8] . Of the confirmed cases, 2788 are severe and 426 people have died. Most cases were reported from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province, and all provinces have confirmed cases imported from Wuhan and secondary transmission has been reported in some provinces. Additionally, there were 153 cases reported in 23 countries outside of China, with most having a travel history involving Wuhan [6] .The potential pathway from this local outbreak in Wuhan to a pandemic might involve four steps: i) local transmission in Wuhan (primary city of epidemic); ii) spread from Wuhan to other cities within and beyond China via infected travellers, causing sporadic secondary transmission in these cities (secondary city of epidemic), iii) further spreading from secondary cities with local transmission to other tertiary cities in China and international cities via returning travellers after the LNY holiday; iv) onward transmission across multiple countries and leading to a pandemic. To interrupt the spread, a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, just two days before the LNY's Day. However, significant numbers of people had likely already travelled back to their hometowns for the holiday by this time. According to Wuhan authorities, it is .

Given the current epidemic and limited understanding of the epidemiology of this disease, our findings on travel patterns from historical data can help contribute to tailoring public health interventions.

Methods

To identify the areas that are most vulnerable to virus importation, we performed and integrated a series of analyses, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone-based population movement data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. We defined the potential risk and geographic range of 2019-nCoV virus spread across three scenarios: 1) from the primary city (Wuhan) into other cities in mainland China (31 provincial regions), 2) from high-risk secondary cities into other cities across China, and 3) from high-risk cities in mainland China into cities in other countries or regions during the LNY holiday and the following three months. We also estimated the number of airline travellers likely needing to be quarantined or screened to capture travellers potentially exposed to 2019-nCoV in high-risk cities of mainland China.

Spread risk and destinations of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan

To define daily patterns and the connectivity of population movements at county and prefecture (city) level across mainland China during the LNY holiday and the following three months, we used the aggregated and de-identified daily flow of the users of Baidu, the largest Chinese search engine [10] . Baidu offers location-based service (LBS), based on the global positioning system (GPS), IP address, location of signalling towers and WIFI, for online searching, mapping, and a large variety of apps and software for mobile devices. These data have been used to visualize population migration around Chinese New Year [10] . Two Baidu datasets were used in this study. The first one covers daily movement data at county level from December 1 st , 2013 to April 30 th , 2014, as described elsewhere [11] . We calculated relative .

The last recorded locations of a user (or device) for each day were compared, and if the location changed, then we counted the user (or device) as someone who had moved from one city to another city. To understand the spread risk of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan into other cities via domestic population movement, we aggregated daily outflows of people from Wuhan to other cities across mainland China for the two weeks (the quarantine period of the virus) prior to the cordon sanitaire of Wuhan. As the travel ban took place on January 23 rd , 2020, just 2 days before LNY's day, and given that LNY's day in 2015 was February 19 th , we took February 17 th , 2015 as a reference of the lockdown day in our dataset. Using the second dataset, then the risk of importation for each destination city or province was preliminarily defined as the percentage of travellers received by each city or province out of the total volume of travellers leaving Wuhan during the two weeks before the city's lockdown.

Spread risk from high-risk secondary cities in mainland China

These secondary cities may have a high risk of community-level transmission through the introduction of infected travellers from Wuhan, and then spread the virus to other tertiary cities by returning population movements after the LNY holiday, causing an even wider spread of the virus. As most of the cities in Hubei province have implemented the same travel controls as Wuhan before LNY, we defined the high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei province as the cities within top 30 ranked cities (Supplementary Table S1 ) with the highest risk of importation from Wuhan defined above. Based on the 2015 Baidu dataset on population movement, the risk of spreading the virus from high-risk secondary cities to tertiary cities was preliminarily calculated as the averaged percentage of travellers received by each tertiary city out of the total volume of travellers leaving each high-risk secondary city during the four weeks following LNY's Day. We chose a period of four weeks because the returning flow of LNY's population movement, Chunyun, generally lasts four weeks..

Destinations of the virus spreading beyond mainland China

To define the connectivity and risk of 2019n-CoV spreading from Wuhan and high-risk secondary cities defined above, into the cities beyond mainland China, we obtained aggregated itinerary data from the International Air Travel Association (IATA) [13] . IATA data accounts for approximately 90% of passenger travel itineraries on commercial flights, and these data represent direct origin (Wuhan) to destination trips, and indirect trips that originated in Wuhan, but had connecting flights to a final destination. We quantified monthly volumes of airline travellers departing Wuhan and high-risk secondary cities from February 1 st , 2018, through April 30 th , 2018. With the assumption that the population movements around the LNY holiday in 2020 was consistent with the pattern in 2018, all final destinations were ranked by volumes of airline travellers, and the relative risk of importation was defined as the percentage of airline travellers received by each destination city out of the total volume of travellers leaving high-risk cities in China.We also estimated the number of airline travellers that may have needed to be kept in quarantine from Wuhan during the two weeks prior to the city's travel ban. The LNY's day in 2018 was on February 16 and the lockdown of Wuhan happened two days before LNY's day, corresponding to the date of February 14 th , 2018. We therefore defined the number of travellers needing to be quarantined as half of the volume of airline travellers from Wuhan in February, 2018, representing the 2-week total number of travellers for the first half of February. We then estimated the number of infections and its 95% uncertainty interval (UI) in these airline travellers from Wuhan, based on a binomial distribution and the proportion of 2019-nCoV infections in the citizens evacuated from Wuhan reported by Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Germany, as of January 31 st , 2020 [6, [14] [15] [16] [17] .Additionally, to capture travellers potentially exposed to virus, we also estimated the volume of airline travellers that would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April. Considering air traffic flows from China have changed due to the airline flight cancellations, travel restrictions imposed by countries or regions, or changes in travel behaviours, we calculated the volume of travellers using different scenarios of reductions (50%, 75%, and 90%) in total passenger volumes..

Validation

As we used historial data to predict travel patterns in 2020, to ensure that the seasonal patterns observed over LNY and holidays more generally are consistent over multiple years and countries, we collated country-level domestic and international passenger statistics for air travel from 2010 to 2018, and compared these against a comprehensive time series of public and school holidays across the world during the same period (Supplementary Note). Additionally, we also compared the spatial patterns of the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan, estimated by the population movement data in 2014 and 2015, and more recent data on the top 50 ranked origin and destination cities in January 2020, available from the Baidu Migration site (https://qianxi.baidu.com/). To futher validate our results, we also compared the importation risk estimated in this study with the number of reported imported cases from Wuhan to other provinces in mainland China, as of January 25 th , 2020, and the number of imported cases reported by other countries or regions, as of February 3 rd , 2020 [6] . The distribution between days of travelling from Wuhan, illness onset, first medical visit, and hospitalization of imported cases, as of January 25 th , 2020, were also analysed. These case data were collated from the websites of WHO, national and local health authorities or new agencies within and beyond China (Supplementary Note). R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to perform data analyses.

Risk and destinations of virus spread within mainland China

Significant migratory flows occurred in opposite directions before and after LNY's Day. In Wuhan City, mass movements of people began about three weeks prior to LNY, with the first peak of population leaving the city before the start of the winter holiday for universities, especially in the three counties that contain many universities and students (Figure 1 ). Although a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and some cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, the timing of this may have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan, as another peak of movements out of the city was seen 2 days before LNY's day.We found that a large number of travellers were likely departing Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China before Wuhan's .

Other cities in Hubei Province received huge amounts of people during the two weeks before LNY and showed a decreasing population since LNY, following a peak of outflow at the end of the LNY holiday (Figure 1b and Supplementary Table S2 ). If Wuhan's lockdown had not have been undertaken, our analyses suggest the main destination cities of population outflow since LNY would have been similar to the situation two weeks prior to LNY (Supplementary Table S3 ).In terms of the initial importation risk of virus for each city during the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, nearly all other cities in Hubei Province were estimated to be high-risk areas (Figure 2a ). Other places with high risks were Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other large cities. In terms of the provincial level, the risks were high in Guangdong and Hunan, followed by Henan and Zhejiang (Figure 2b ). There was a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.59, p < 0.001) between the number of imported cases and the risk of importation estimated from traveller numbers from Wuhan within the two weeks before LNY's Day (Figure 3a ). Further, a high proportion of cases travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak, and the lag from illness onset to hospitalization decreased from a median of 6 days (Interquartile range: 4-7 days) in the first half of January 2020 to 3 days (1-5 days) in the second half ( Figure 4 ).According to our definition outlined in the methods, the 17 high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei Province were identified as: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changsha, Xi'an, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Nanchang, Chengdu, Hefei, Fuzhou, and Dongguan ( Figure 5) . Should community-level outbreaks occur in these cities, they could contribute to further spread of infection to other highly connected cities within China via movement after the holiday (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ).

International spread risk and destinations

Based on historical air travel data, the connectivity and spread risk between high-risk cities in mainland China and cities in other countries or regions was defined for the three months around the LNY holiday (Supplementary Figure S3 and Tables S4 and S5). Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Taipei ranked in the top three, followed by Seoul, Tokyo and Singapore. The main destinations were presented by region in the supplemental materials (Supplementary Figures S3-S9 and Table S4 -S7). During the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, there were an estimated total 59,912 airline .

Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan ranked in the top three, followed by Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Based on an overall infection rate of 1.39% (16/1149; 95% UI: 0.80% -2.25%) in citizens evacuated from Wuhan before Table S8 ). As of February 3 rd , 2020, a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.58, p < 0.001) was seen between the number of imported cases reported in those countries or regions and the risk of importation via travellers defined in our study (Figure 3b ).Because significant intranational and international spread from Wuhan has already occurred, a very large number of airline travellers (6.5 million under the scenario of 50% travel reduction as usual, 3.3 million under 75% reduction, and 1.3 million under 90% reduction, respectively) would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China ( Figure 5 ) and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 (Table 1 and  Supplementary Tables S9 and S10) , to ensure that all travellers from high risk cities were covered.Addtionally, based on monthly air passenger travel statistics and time series of public and school holidays in 91 countries from 2010 to 2018 (Supplementary Note), we found the seasonal pattens of domestic and international population movements across years were highly consistent with the timing and duration of public and school holidays in different countries (Supplementary Figure S10 and S11) . Moreover, we also found similar spatial patterns in the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan via population movements estimated by both the Baidu data in 2014 and 2015, and the more recent data covering the top 50 ranked destinations in 2020, (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S12) , highlighting the value of using historical data to rapidly assess present day risks.

Given the rapidly growing number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infections, increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission within and beyond China [4, 24] , and our limited understanding of this novel virus [25, 26] , the findings here from travel patterns in historical data and spread risk estimation can help guide public health preparedness and intervention design across the world [27] .In terms of domestic connectivity and risk, the high population outflows from three counties in Wuhan with many colleges and universities in the first two weeks of January were likely college students leaving the city to avoid the peak traffic just one week before the New Year. Because of the early timing of this movement, many students might have avoided the period when the virus spread rapidly in Wuhan, and their risk of spreading the virus may be low as well. However, our results suggest that during the two weeks prior to Wuhan's travel ban, a large number of travellers still departed Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China and may have spread the virus to new areas, as the timing of the lockdown occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan. Further exacerbating this risk, we found that during the outbreak's initial stages, a particularly high proportion of cases travelled with illness caused by the virus, together with the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV through asymptomatic contacts, potentially causing additional transmission during travel [28] .Moreover, several destination cities ( Figure 5 ) outside of Hubei Province that received high volume of travellers from Wuhan prior to LNY's day may serve as significant secondary cities in the outbreak. Most of these cities have large populations and international airports, highly connected with other regions within and beyond China. The initial imported seed cases likely caused the local community transmission, and further spread the virus into wider geographical ranges following the population flows occurring due to the LNY holiday [19] . Therefore, substantial public health interventions have been immediately applied across the country since LNY, including the cordon sanitaire in several of the most affected cities, cancellation of mass gatherings, reduction of travel and contact rate, as well as the extension of the LNY and school winter holiday, which might mitigate subsequent local establishment of 2019-nCoV introduced by travellers.Beyond the cases that have occurred in China, air passengers have spread 2019-nCoV across countries and continents within a short time period [28, 29] . In particular, a high volume of international airline travellers left .

Substantial preparedness efforts at destination cities should be taken to prevent further international seeding and transmission, otherwise the local establishment of epidemics, and even a pandemic, might become inevitable. For example, exit and entry screening may be futher extended to capture travellers with fever who have potentially been exposed to the virus in high-risk Chinese cities where local transmission has been established. However, we estimated that a huge volume of airline travellers would be required to be screened in February to April, even under the scenario of significant reduction (90%) in air passengers compared with the same period of previous years. Therefore, ensuring that surveillance and health systems around the world are ready and sufficiently strong to detect and deal with cases seen is a priority.It is expected that further international exportation of cases from China will occur and cases may appear in any country [30] . Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of the 2019-nCoV infection [6, 31] . Of additional concern is that the anticipated destinations of hundreds of thousands of travellers departing China are to low-income or lower-middle income countries, where inadequately resourced medical and public health systems might be unable to detect and adequately manage an imported case of 2019n-CoV, including possible subsequent community spread.Due to current limited knowledge of the epidemiology of the virus at the time of writing (e.g. the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic or subclinical infections) and the rapidly changing situation of the outbreak, the simplicity of our approach to define importation risk can help to quickly update risk assessments, prioritise surveillance, target limited resources and understand the potential of 2019n-CoV introduction at specific destinations [32] . Compared with other studies [33, 34] , we explored the various scenarios of travel restriction and used a more comprehensive and spatio-temporally detailed population movement matrix, together with details on the actual final destination cities of air passengers based on the global itinerary dataset. These novel datasets provide new insights on the impacts of internal and international connectivity on potential transmission of this emerging pathogen during the LNY holiday and over the next three months.Nevertheless, it is important to note that our study has several major limitations. Firstly, while we do present simple scenarios of reduced air travel volumes, our primary analyses assume ""business as usual"" travel based on .

Second, the mobile phone data used may provide an incomplete and biased picture of travellers, as the data only cover the population owning a smart phone and using Baidu apps. Third, the case data used in this study likely varies in quality and completeness due to the timeliness of reporting, varying laboratory diagnosis capacities, and differences in details announced on health authority websites. Fourth, compared with airline travellers leaving Wuhan prior to January 23 rd evacuees from Wuhan during the January 29 th -31 st period might have a higher risk of infection due to their longer stay in Wuhan during the potential continued spread of the virus since January 23 rd . This may result in overestimates of the number of infections in airline travellers from Wuhan prior to the city's lockdown. Based on more recent population movement and epidemiological data, we aim to conduct more sophisticated modelling approaches to assess the effectiveness of control measures in China, the impact of movements of people returning from LNY holiday, as well as the risks of a 2019-nCoV global pandemic..

"Abstract

Elucidating antiviral CD8 T lymphocyte responses to SARS-CoV-2 may shed light on the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes and inform vaccine or therapeutic approaches. To facilitate the evaluation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, we generated a publicly accessible database of epitopes predicted to bind any class I HLA protein across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. While a subset of epitopes from earlier betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV (SARS), have been validated experimentally, validation systems are often biased toward specific HLA haplotypes (notably HLA-A*02:01) that only account for a fraction of the haplotypes of individuals affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To enable evaluation of epitopes across individuals with a variety of HLA haplotypes, we computed the predicted binding affinities between 9-mer peptides derived from the annotated SARS-CoV-2 peptidome across 9,360 MHC class I HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles. There were 6,748 unique combinations of peptides and HLA alleles (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity of less than 500nM, including 1,103 unique peptides and 1,022 HLA alleles, spanning 11 annotated superfamilies. These peptides were derived from all 11 proteins spanning the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome, including peptides that have previously been validated experimentally. We also show evidence that these previously

","Introduction

In a subset of patients, SARS-CoV-2 can result in COVID-19, which can be a deadly disease with hallmarks of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)(1). Other patients harboring SARS-CoV-2 can have minimal or no symptoms. While clinical factors such as older age and underlying medical conditions have been reported as potential risk factors for more severe disease (2) , the heterogeneity of clinical response to this viral agent is otherwise poorly understood.Cytotoxic CD8 + T lymphocyte responses are crucial for initial viral clearance and development of immunologic memory (3) . CD8 T cell responses are a plausible contributor to immunopathology following viral infection (4) . Excessive cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses and resultant cytokine release by these and other cells may contribute to ARDS, while less effective CD8 T cell responses may allow progression of viral pathology.The heterogeneity in CD8 T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 may in part be related to the capacity to recognize the viral antigens in the context of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. Indeed, genetic susceptibilities to viral infection have been tied to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes (5) . Meanwhile, functional differences in antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients may also contribute to the biology of at-risk populations. Together, this knowledge may aid in designing and monitoring the impact of antiviral vaccines.As a resource to explore antigen and HLA specific CTL responses, we used a computational approach previously developed to define neoantigen-specific CD8 T cell responses in patients with cancer (6) . With this approach, we predicted all potential peptides that bind a globally representative set of MHC I alleles across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We have made this resource free and available to the public, and the resource will be updated through https://covid-19.parkerici.org/docs/data_sets/mhc_peptidome.html as additional data becomes available pertaining to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, proteome, and epitome.

Results

We deployed peptide binding predictions across 9-mer peptides derived from 1,075 protein sequences spanning 166 SARS-CoV-2 genotypes for 9,360 class I HLA alleles (2,987 HLA-A; 3,707 HLA-B; 2,666 HLA-C). Peptide binding predictions were filtered to those with a high-binding affinity (<500nM) to identify putative class I HLA antigens ( Figure 1A ). There were 6,748 unique combinations of peptides and HLA alleles (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity of less than 500nM (Supplementary Table 3) , including 1,103 unique peptides and 1,022 HLA alleles (295 HLA-A, 614 HLA-B, and 113 HLA-C).In order to better understand the class I antigenic profile of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we focused on pMHCs with a binding affinity of less than 500nM (n=6,748). Of the 1,103 unique peptides comprising these pMHCs, there were between 1 and 55 (median 3) alleles that could bind each peptide (Figure 1B) , indicating that multiple HLA types could present the same antigens. Antigens were annotated by their corresponding protein (Methods) to identify which viral proteins may be responsible for class I recognition. There were between 12 and 684 (median 31) high-binding peptides observed in each of the 11 viral proteins (Orf1ab, Surface/Spike Glycoprotein, Orf3a, Envelope (Orf4; E), Membrane Glycoprotein, Orf6, Orf7a, Orf7b, Orf8, Nucleocapsid (Orf9), and Orf10; Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 1) . These predicted peptides were distributed throughout each protein ( Figure 1D) . Orf1ab was the largest protein and had the highest number of peptides (n=684), followed by the Surface/Spike Glycoprotein (n=109) and the Nucleocapsid (Orf9; n=60). When normalized by amino acid length, the largest proteins had the lowest density of peptides.We were additionally interested in the diversity and number of the HLA alleles that could bind each predicted SARS-CoV-2 peptide. HLA alleles were annotated by their gene and structural superfamily (Supplementary Table 4)(7). In addition, we specifically highlighted the HLA-A*02 allele group, due to the prevalence of this allele . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

There were more peptides with predicted high binding affinities for HLA-A (n=438 unique peptides) and -B (n=552) alleles, compared to -C (n=243) (Supplementary Figure 2 ). However, overall, a diverse set of HLA alleles are predicted to bind antigens spanning the viral proteome ( Figure 2) . Notably, our predicted peptides with high-affinity binding were all included in the homologous sequences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.Due to the partial homology between SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, we evaluated whether any experimentally validated epitopes from SARS-CoV were identified in our study (Supplementary Table 5 ). Using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (8), we enumerated 30 HLA class I 9-mer epitopes that were validated by T cell assays (cytokine release assays, tetramer staining, and/or cytotoxicity assays) in clinical samples (including those derived from patients that had recovered from a prior SARS-CoV infection and normal donors) and humanized mouse models (e.g. HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice). Of these 30 epitopes, 10 were also seen in our filtered results ( Table 1) ; there were two additional 9-mers that were contained within previously validated 10-mers. These included epitopes corresponding to the HLA-A*02 (n=20), HLA-A*11 (n=1), and HLA-B*40 (n=1) allele groups. Of note, of the 12 predicted epitopes with corresponding experimental validation, six were also predicted as highbinding antigens across other allele groups.Grifoni, et al. recently used the homology between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteomes and the existing annotated epitopes of SARS-CoV from the IEDB (8) to infer T cell epitopes derived from SARS-CoV-2(9). Our prediction identified 10 of the 25 dominant class 1 HLA 9-mer epitopes from that study. In addition, our study reports 1,088 additional predicted peptides that may serve as a resource for experimental validation.

Discussion

Our study was designed to evaluate the predicted MHC class I epitope landscape with respect to the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteome across a globally representative set of HLA alleles. We aimed to establish a resource for the scientific community, and have made the entirety of these data publicly available. This work expands upon recent studies that inferred the epitope landscape of SARS-CoV-2 based on its partial homology with SARS-CoV, for which there is an existing annotated epitope landscape(9, 10).Our analysis was restricted to pMHC complexes with predicted binding affinities of less than 500nM. Subsequent analysis did not treat the predicted binding affinities as a continuous variable (i.e. predicted values of 5nM and 400nM were treated similarly in the remaining analysis). The pMHC binding affinities presented here are computationally defined. In the absence of experimental validation, we did not try to further delineate the association between HLA diversity and the predicted binding affinity. Furthermore, utilizing a threshold of 500nM may result in underestimating the number of alleles associated with the predicted antigenic peptides. Thus, this analysis could be expanded to consider pMHCs with binding affinities slightly greater than 500nM.We also compared our filtered results to experimental efforts to validate viral epitopes of the homologous virus SARS-CoV over the last two decades. Our prediction successfully identified 12 of 32 previously validated HLA class I peptides across the SARS-CoV viral peptidome. Moreover, we predict that there are additional HLA types that may successfully bind and present these antigens.This dataset and analysis have limitations. Our search was restricted to perfectly matched amino acid sequences, and there may be peptides associated with SARS-CoV-2 that have mismatches, compared to SARS-CoV. Our search was also limited to 9-mers, which represents most but not all reported HLA class I binding peptides. In addition, we did not further assess peptide sequences in pMHCs with affinities greater than 500nM and refined searches will be necessary to completely assess the homology between the SARS-CoV and SARS- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.016931 doi: bioRxiv preprint CoV-2 epitomes. Our data also does not account for either the quantity or timing of viral protein expression in a host cell, both of which can impact the immunogenicity of predicted epitopes (11) .CD4 T cell responses are also an important aspect of antiviral clearance and memory, but these were not included owing to the limitations in predicting human HLA class II epitopes (12) . Lastly, the HLA binding prediction algorithms used in this study are trained based on antigen binding affinities available in the IEDB. Thus, our results are biased toward previously studied epitopes and HLA haplotypes and unlikely to be exhaustive, particularly in our list of filtered high-binding pMHC. As a result, we have deposited data for all predicted epitopes, even those with lower pMHC binding affinity.With the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there are worldwide efforts to collect blood and tissue samples from persons who are asymptomatic, symptomatic with limited or serious complications, and convalescent. It is possible that patients who have the most severe forms of the disease, including ARDS, may have an increased functionality of CD8 T cells recognizing specific antigens presented by one of their HLAs, which could be specifically studied using the predicted epitopes described herein. In addition, preventive vaccines may require monitoring not only the induction of an antibody response, which is usually delayed, but also an earlier CD8 T cell response to specific antigens within the context of the patient's HLA subtypes. Given the global reach of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this database of predicted HLA class I binding peptides may serve as a guide to identify and monitor phenotypic, functional and kinetic responses of putative SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cells across patients with a broad range of HLA haplotypes internationally.

SARS-CoV-2 data acquisition and protein annotation

The protein fasta containing 1,075 protein sequences, spanning 166 genotypes for SARS-CoV-2 were accessed using the NCBI Virus resource (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/) on March 15, 2020 (Supplementary Table 1) . Of the 1,075 accession identifiers for proteins, there were 144 unique amino acid sequences. These were further reduced to 22 groups by overlapping amino acid sequences (i.e. some accessions were regions within annotated proteins). Using the named annotation of these accession identifiers, these 22 groups of accession identifiers were annotated by the 11 named proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome; 8 accession identifiers were labeled 'UNKNOWN' because they were not annotated with protein names.

Peptide-MHC binding prediction

MHC binding predictions were performed on 9-mer peptides derived from the protein fasta, across 9,360 haplotypes of class I HLA-A, -B, and -C, (Supplementary Table 2 ) using the pvacbind tool from pVACtools (6) and nine prediction algorithms (MHCflurry, MHCnuggetsI, NNalign, NetMHC, PickPocket, SMM, SMMPMBEC, SMMalign, NetMHC). The following parameters were used: -b (BINDING_THRESHOLD) 500 -m, --top-score-metric median --net-chop-method cterm --netmhc-stab TRUE These jobs were executed on the Google Cloud Platform using Terra and the griffithlab/pvactools Docker container. The binding affinities for each prediction were summarized by their Median Score.

Assignment of peptides to proteins

Peptides were assigned to proteins based upon the protein annotation described above. Peptides per amino acid (Peptides/AA) were calculated by taking the total number of high-binding (<500nM) peptides associated with the protein accession divided by the length of the protein. These numbers were aggregated by the average Peptides/AA per protein.

"Abstract

COVID-19 has become a pandemic. The influence of meteorological factors on the transmission and spread of COVID-19 if of interest. This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the daily count of COVID-19 cases in 30 ChineseAdditive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods. In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004-0.07) in Hubei. Every 1°C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04°C to 8.2°C. However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China.

Tibet was not included in the following model since only one case was reported during the 23-day period.The meteorological data, including daily average temperature (AT) and daily average relative humidity (ARH) of each provincial capital, were retrieved from Weather Underground (https://www.wunderground.com/).

Statistical analysis

A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods, accounting for short-term temporal trend and health-seeking behavior through Baidu index.The distribution of COVID-19 cases was assumed to be a negative binomial given that the variances of the daily counts were larger than their means.Considering the incubation period of COVID-19, the effects of AT, ARH, and covariates were modeled with a 14-day exponential moving average (EMA) to account of their potential lag effects and the interaction between AT and ARH was tested and included in the model if significant.

Sensitivity analysis

To verify model results, a sensitivity analysis was performed in which the time-series in Wuhan and in Hubei province were restricted to the period the same as that in other provinces − i.e. January 20 to February 11 − with the same GAM fit to the data (the results of sensitivity analysis in Figs.

Results

The daily counts of confirmed cases, AT, and ARH for 31 provinces were summarized in Table A1 . The cumulative confirmed cases varied from one (Tibet) to 33,453 (Hubei), and 74.7% of all confirmed cases occurred in Hubei for the periods (Fig. 1a) . The average AT ranged from −16.96°C to 19.3°C (Fig.   1b) , and the average ARH ranged from 17.93% to 86.20% (Fig. 1c) . The estimates of regression coefficients of the GAM for Hubei province are listed in Table 1 . There was a significant interaction between AT and ARH (0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.004-0.07), and the effect of the Baidu index was also statistically significant.

Discussion

Our study suggests that both daily temperature and relative humidity influenced the occurrence of COVID-19 in Hubei province and in some other provinces.However, the association between COVID-19 and AT and ARH across the provinces was not consistent. We found spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 incidence, as well as its relationship with daily AT and ARH, among provinces in Mainland China.The study period − and hence time series length − was longer for Hubei province than other provinces. The longer the study period, the more stable the model results are expected to be. Considering the incubation period of COVID-19, we used the 14-day EMA of daily AT and ARH to investigate the effects of ARH and AT on COVID-19. Most of the confirmed cases (and therefore meteorological data) were derived from the period before travel restrictions were enacted for Wuhan city (January 23, 2020); therefore, the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20044099 doi: medRxiv preprint while low temperature can also dry out the mucous membrane, reduce the function of cilia, and support the survival and transmission of the virus and the spread of diseases [6, 8, 14, 19, 20] .A novel finding of this study is the significant interaction between ARH and AT, and COVID-19 transmission. In Hubei province, the interaction between ARH and AT was found to have a positive effect on transmission (0.04, 95% CI: 0.004-0.07). Increased AT (ARH) led to a decreased effect of ARH (AT) on the incidence of COVID-19 in Hubei province. The exact mechanism of the interaction is unclear. One probable reason might be that a combination of low AT and humidity make the nasal mucosa prone to small ruptures, creating opportunities for virus invasion [21] . A previous study observed an interaction between minimum temperature and humidity on influenza [22, 23] There are some limitations in our study. First, some potential risk factors that could impact the incidence of COVID-19 − for example, province-specific social-economic status − were not included in the model. The study period is short, so that it can be assumed that many covariates did not vary substantially during such a short time period. Second, the incidence of COVID-19 in provinces other than Hubei was more likely to be influenced by interventions after the outbreak in Hubei province. In addition, the meteorological data were collected from the Weather Underground for the capital city for each province only, and data accuracy and representativeness can be improved in future studies. Provinces (except for Hubei) had a short study period and included 1 1 many imported cases.In conclusion, meteorological factors influence COVID-19 transmission and spread, potentially with an interactive effect between daily temperature and relative humidity on COVID-19 incidence. There were spatial and temporal heterogeneities in COVID-19 occurrence, which could be attributed to meteorological factors as well as interventions measures across provinces. The reasons for the inconsistency in the impact of meteorological factors on COVID-19 among provinces needs further study.

"Abstract

Estimation of the fraction and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection.Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness.We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020).

infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3 .00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably.

Conclusions

A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.The novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 quickly spread to all Chinese provinces and, as of February 6, 2020, to 24 other countries 1, 2 . Efforts to contain the virus are ongoing; however, given the many uncertainties regarding pathogen transmissibility and virulence, the effectiveness of these efforts is unknown.The fraction of undocumented but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological characteristic that modulates the pandemic potential of an emergent respiratory virus 3−6 . These undocumented infections often experience mild, limited or no symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to virus than would otherwise occur. Here, to assess the full potential of COVID-19, we use a modelinference framework to estimate the contagiousness and proportion of undocumented infections in China during the weeks before and after the shutdown of travel in and out of Wuhan.

Metapopulation Model

We developed a mathematical model that simulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of infections among 375 Chinese cities. The model incorporates information on human movement within the following metapopulation structure: [5] where < , < , < A , < B and < are the susceptible, exposed, documented infected, undocumented infected and total population in city i. Note that we define patients with symptoms severe enough to be confirmed as documented infected individuals; whereas other infected persons are defined as undocumented infected individuals. We specified a rate parameter, β, for the transmission rate due to documented infected individuals. The transmission rate due to undocumented individuals is reduced by a factor . In addition, is the fraction of documented infections, Z is the average latency period and D is the average duration of infection. The effective reproduction number ( 4 ) is calculated as 4 = + (1 − ) (see Supplementary Appendix for details). Spatial coupling within the model is represented by the daily number of people traveling from city j to city i ( <3 ) and a multiplicative factor, , which is greater than 1 to reflect underreporting of human movements (see below). We assume that individuals in the < A group do not move between cities. A similar metapopulation model has been used to forecast the spatial transmission of influenza in the United States 7 .

Travel Data

Daily numbers of travelers between 375 Chinese cities during the Spring Festival period (""Chunyun"") were derived from human mobility data collected by the Tencent Location-based Service (LBS) during the 2018 Chunyun period (February 1 -March 12, 2018) 8 . Chunyun is a period of 40 days -15 days before and 25 days after the Lunar New Year -during which there are high rates of travel within China. To estimate human mobility during the 2020 Chunyun period, which began January 10, we aligned the 2018 Tencent data based on relative timing to the Spring Festival. For example, we used mobility data from February 1, 2018 to represent human movement on January 10, 2020, as these days were similarly distant from the Lunar New Year. During the 2018 Chunyun, a total of 1.73 billion travel events were captured in the Tencent data; whereas 2.97 billions trips are reported 8 . To reconcile these two numbers, we include the parameter in the model system.

Inference and Model Initialization

To infer COVID-19 transmission dynamics during the early stage of the outbreak, we simulated observations from January 10-23, 2020 (i.e. the period before the initiation of travel restrictions) using an iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) framework [9] [10] [11] . With this combined model-inference system, we estimated the trajectories of the four model state variables ( < , < , < A , < B ) for all 375 cities, while simultaneously inferring the six model parameters (Z, D, , , , ). The initial prior ranges of the model parameters were drawn from uniform distributions of the following ranges: 2 ≤ ≤ 5 , 2 ≤ ≤ 5 , 0.2 ≤ ≤ 1, 0.6 ≤ ≤ 1.5, 0.02 ≤ ≤ 0.8, 1 ≤ ≤ 1.75.For the outbreak origin, Wuhan city, the initial exposed population, VBWXY , and initial undocumented infected population, VBWXY B , were drawn from a uniform distribution [0, \X] ]. The documented infected population in Wuhan VBWXY A on January 10 was set to zero. Although infections were reported prior to January 10, these cases were sporadic and the EAKF adjustment can account for the effects of these early infections (by selecting elevated exposed and unreported infection levels). For other cities, we defined < as the number of travelers from Wuhan to city on the first day of Chunyun. The initial exposed, documented infected and undocumented infected populations were set to < = < VBWXY / VBWXY , < A = 0 and <To account for delays in infection confirmation, we also defined an observation model using a Poisson process. Specifically, for each new case in group < A , a reporting delay ! (in days) was generated from a Poisson distribution with a mean value of ! . In fitting both synthetic and the observed outbreaks, we performed simulations with the model-inference system using different fixed values of ! (4 ≤ ! ≤ 12 ) and \X] (500 ≤ \X] ≤ 6000). The best fitting model-inference posterior was identified by log-likelihood. Full details of the data and methods, including synthetic testing and sensitivity analyses, are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.

Modelling epidemic dynamics after January 23

Finally, we also modelled the transmission of COVID-19 in China after January 23, when greater control measures were effected. These control measures included travel restrictions imposed between major cities and Wuhan; self-quarantine and contact precautions advocated by the government; and more available rapid testing for infection confirmation [12] [13] . These measures along with changes in medical careseeking behaviour due to increased awareness of the virus and increased personal protective behavior (e.g. wearing of facemasks, social distancing, self-isolation when sick), likely altered the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak after January 23. To quantify these differences, we re-estimated the system parameters using the metapopulation model-inference framework and city-level daily cases reported between January 24 and February 8. As inter-city mobility was restricted, we set = 0. In addition, to represent reduced person-to-person contact and increased infection detection, we updated the initial priors for and to [0.2, 1.0] and [0.2, 1.0], respectively (see Supplementary Appendix for more details).

Epidemiological Characteristics before January 23, 2020

We first tested the model-inference framework using synthetic outbreaks generated by the model in free simulation. These simulations verified the ability of the modelinference framework to simultaneously estimate the six target model parameters (see Supplementary Appendix, Figures S1-S8) .We next applied the system to the observed outbreak before the travel restrictions of January 23 -a total of 811 documented cases throughout China. Figure 1 shows simulations of reported cases generated using the best-fitting model parameter estimates. The distribution of these stochastic simulations captures the range of observed cases well. In addition, the best-fitting model captures the spread of COVID-19 to other cities in China ( Figure S9 ). Our median estimate of the overall 4 is 2.23 (95% CI: 1.77−3.00), indicating a high capacity for sustained transmission of COVID-19 (Table 1) . This finding aligns with other recent estimates of the reproductive number for this time period 6, [12] [13] [14] . In addition, the median estimates for the latent and infectious periods are approximately 3.77 and 3.45 days, respectively. Further, we find that, during January 10-23, only 14% (95% CI: 9-26%) of total infections in China were reported. This estimate reveals a very high rate of undocumented infections: 86%. This finding is independently corroborated by the infection rate among foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan (see Supplementary Appendix). These undocumented infections are estimated to have been half as contagious per individual as reported infections (µ = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.44 -0.69). Other model fittings made using alternate values of ! and \X] produced similar parameter estimates ( Figure S10 ).

The Impact of Undocumented Infections during January 10-23

Using the best-fitting model ( To highlight further this impact of contagious, undocumented COVID-19 infections on overall transmission and reported case counts, we generated a set of hypothetical outbreaks using the best-fitting parameter estimates but with = 0, i.e. the undocumented infections are no longer contagious (Figure 2) . We find that without transmission from undocumented cases, reported infections during January 10-23 are reduced 66.4% across all of China and 64.0% in Wuhan. Further, there are fewer cities with more than 8 cumulative documented cases: only 1 city with more than 8 documented cases versus the 10 observed by January 23 (Figure 2 ). This finding indicates that contagious, undocumented infections facilitated the geographic spread of COVID-19 within China.

Epidemiological Characteristics after January 23, 2020

The results of inference for the January 24-February 8 period are presented in Table  2 , Figure S11 and Table S1 . Control measures are continually shifting, so we show estimates for both January 24 -February 3 (Period 1) and January 24 -February 8 (Period 2). The best-fitting model for both periods has a reduced reporting delay, ! , of 5 days (vs. 10 days before January 23), consistent with more rapid confirmation of infections. Estimates of both the latency and infectious periods are relatively unchanged; however, , and 4 have all shifted considerably. The contact rate, , drops to 0.51 (95% CI: 0.39 -0.69) during Period 1 and 0.34 (95% CI: 0.27 -0.48) during Period 2, less than half the estimate prior to travel restrictions. The reporting rate, , is estimated to be 0.71 (95% CI: 0.55 -0.85), i.e. 71% of infections are documented during Period 1, up from 0.14 prior to travel restrictions, and is nearly the same in Period 2. The reproductive number is 1.51 (95% CI: 1.17 -2.10) during Period 1 and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.73 -1.38) during Period 2, down from 2.23 prior to travel restrictions. While the estimate for the relative transmission rate, , is similar to before January 23, the contagiousness of undocumented infections, represented by , is substantially reduced, possibly reflecting that only very mild and asymptomatic infections remain undocumented.

Discussion

Our findings indicate that a large proportion of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to the implementation of travel restrictions and other heightened control measures in China on January 23, and that a large proportion of the total force of infection was mediated through these undocumented infections (Table 1) . This high proportion of undocumented infections, many of whom were likely not severely symptomatic, appears to have supported the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. Indeed, suppression of the infectiousness of these undocumented cases in model simulations reduces the total number of documented cases and the overall spread of COVID-19 (Figure 2 ).Our findings also indicate that a radical increase in the identification and isolation of currently undocumented infections would be needed to fully control COVID-19.Increased news coverage and awareness of the virus in the general population have already likely prompted increased rates of seeking medical care for respiratory symptoms. In addition, awareness among healthcare providers, public health officials and the availability of viral identification assays suggest that capacity for identifying previously missed infections has increased. Further, general population and government response efforts have increased the use of face masks, restricted travel, delayed school reopening and isolated suspected persons, all of which could additionally slow the spread of COVID-19.Combined, these measures are expected to increase reporting rates, reduce the proportion of undocumented infections, and decrease the growth and spread of infection. Indeed, estimation of the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak after January 23, indicate that government control efforts and population awareness have reduced the rate of spread of the virus (i.e. lower , , 4 ) and increased the reporting rate. The overall reduction of the effective reproductive number is encouraging; however, the control efforts have yet to critically and clearly reduce 4 below 1.Importantly, the situation on the ground in China is changing day-to-day. New travel restrictions and control measures are being imposed on new populations in different cities, and these rapidly varying effects make certain estimation of the epidemiological characteristics for the outbreak difficult. Further, reporting inaccuracies and changing care-seeking behavior add another level of uncertainty to our estimations. While the data and findings presented here indicate that travel restrictions and control measures have reduced COVID-19 transmission considerably, whether these controls are sufficient for reducing 4 below 1 for the length of time needed to eliminate the disease locally and prevent a rebound outbreak once control measures are relaxed is unclear. Further, similar control measures and travel restrictions would have to be implemented outside China to prevent re-introduction of the virus.Our findings underscore the seriousness and pandemic potential of COVID-19. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus also caused many mild cases, quickly spread globally, and eventually became endemic. Presently, there are four, endemic, coronavirus strains currently circulating in human populations (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43). If the novel coronavirus follows the pattern of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, it will also spread globally and become a fifth endemic coronavirus within the human population.Many characteristics of the COVID-19 remain unknown or uncertain. Consequently, care should be taken when interpreting our estimates. For instance, after January 23, we assume a complete travel shutdown with no inter-city human mobility; however, the degree and initial date of travel restrictions has varied among cities. Our estimates may therefore represent an upper-bound of the potential impact of travel restriction on COVID-19 transmission. Further studies accounting for heterogenous travel interventions are warranted.

"Abstract

The main objective is twofold: first, to model the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease, as represented by the cumulative number of deaths as a function of time; and second, to use the corresponding mathematical model to study the effectiveness of possible intervention strategies.We applied the Richards growth model (RGM) to the COVID-19 fatality curves from several countries, where we used the data from the Johns Hopkins University database up to April 1, 2020. Countries selected for analysis were and Brazil.The RGM was shown to describe very well the fatality curves of China and Italy, which are respectively in a late stage and in the middle of the COVID-19 outbreak. The model was also successful in describing the trend in the other countries studied and which are at the same or earlier stages of the epidemics as Italy. An analytic formula for the efficiency of intervention strategies within the context of the RGM is derived. Our findings show that there is only a narrow window of opportunity, after the onset of the epidemic,

","Background

The response interventions to the pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) have varied from country to country. Several countries, specially those first hit by the disease, have adopted a standard progressive protocol, from containment to mitigation to supression [1] . As these strategies failed to deter the spread of the virus, government authorities introduced ever more stringent measures on their citizens' movements in an attempt to suppress or sharply reduce the propagation of the virus. More recently, countries have adopted drastic countermeasures at the very outset of the outbreak. For example, on March 24, 2020, India announced a threeweek total ban on people ""venturing out"" of their homes [2] , even though there were fewer than 500 confirmed cases and only nine people had died from COVID-19 in a country with a population of 1.3 billion people. One difficulty in deciding the best approach to counter the spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is that the virus propagation dynamics is not yet well understood.In this stark context, it becomes relevant to have simple models for the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemics, so as to be able to obtain estimates -however tentative-for the rise in the number of infected people as well as in the number of fatal cases, both in the near and in the more distant future. Such estimates are, of course, prone to high uncertainty: the less data available and the further in the future, the greater the uncertainty. Notwithstanding their inherent shortcomings, simple mathematical models provide valuable tools for quickly assessing the severity of an epidemics and help to guide the health and political authorities in defining or adjusting their national strategies to fight the disease [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] .In the same vein, it would be desirable to have simple methods to assess the effectiveness of intervention measures as a function of the time at which they are adopted. As a general rule, the sooner an intervention is put in place the more effective it is expected to be. It is however difficult to model a priori how effective any given set of interventions will be. The effectiveness of interventions are often investigated through complex agent-based simulation models [11, 12] , which require a synthetic population and a host of parameters related to the human-to-human transmission, and as such they are very costly computationally [13] and heavily dependent on the choices of values for the various model parameters.In this paper we use the Richards growth model (RGM) [14] to study the fatality curves, represented by the cumulative number of deaths as a function of time, of COVID-19 for different countries that are at different stages of the epidemics. We show that the RGM describes reasonably well the fatality curves of all selected countries analysed in this study. We also introduce a theoretical framework, within the context of the RGM model, to calculate the efficiency of interventions. Here an intervention strategy is modelled by assuming that its net result is to alter the parameters of the RGM after a given time t 0 , so that the full epidemics dynamics is then described in terms of two RGM models: one before and the other after the time t 0 , where certain 'matching conditions' are imposed at t 0 . In this way, we are able to derive an analytical formula for the efficiency of the corresponding intervention as a function of the adoption time t 0 . We show, in particular, that the intervention efficiency quickly decays past a critical adoption time, thus showing that time is really of essence in containing an outbreak.

Data Source

Data used in this study were obtained from the database made publicly available by the Johns Hopkins University [15, 16] , which lists in automated fashion the number of the confirmed cases and deaths per country. We have used data up to April 1, 2020 [15, 17] . In the present study we considered the mortality data of COVID-19 from the following countries: China, Italy, Spain, Iran, Germany, and Brazil.

Confirmed Cases vs. Mortality Data

Because a large proportion of COVID-19 infections go undetected [18] , it is difficult to estimate the actual number of infected people within a given population. As many carriers of the virus are either asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms, they will will not be detected unless they are tested. In other words, the number of confirmed cases for COVID-19 is a poor proxy for the total number of infections. Furthermore, the fraction of confirmed cases relative to the total number of infections depends heavily on the testing policy of each country, which makes it problematic to compare the evolution of confirmed cases among different countries. In contrast, the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 is a much more reliable measure of the advance of the epidemics and its severity. Of course, many other factors, such as age structure of a population and quality of care, may affect the fraction of deaths relative to the number of confirmed cases. Nevertheless, it is expected that overall the evolution of number of deaths bear a relation to the dynamics of the number of infections [19] . Under these circumstances and in the absence of reliable estimates for the number of infected cases for COVID-19, we decided here to seek an alternative approach and model directly the mortality curves, defined as the cumulative number of deaths as a function of time, rather than the number of confirmed cases, as is more usually done.

Mathematical Models

We model the time evolution of the number of cases in the epidemic by means of the Richards growth model (RGM), defined by the following ordinary differential equation (EDO) [20, 21] :where C(t) is the cumulative number of cases at time t, r is the growth rate at the early stage, K is the final epidemic size, and the parameter α measures the asymmetry with respect to the s-shaped dynamics of the standard logistic model, which is recovered for α = 1. It is worth to point out that the Richards model has an intrinsic connection to the SIR epidemic model, see, e.g., [20] , with the advantage that it allows for an exact solution (see below), which makes the data analysis much simpler. As already mentioned, here we shall apply the RGM to the fatality curves of COVID-19, so that C(t) will represent the cumulative numbers of deaths in a given country at time t, where t will be counted in days from the first death. Equation (1) must be supplemented with a boundary condition. Here it is convenient to choose4 All rights reserved.

A direct integration of (1) subjected to condition (2) yields the following explicit formula:where in the left-hand side we have explicitly denoted the dependence of the solution of the RGM on the four parameters, namely r, α, K, and t c . In Sec. 4 we show results of the application of the Richard growth curve (3) to the mortality data of COVID-19 for several countries. We note, however, that the RGM is not reliable in situations where the epidemics is in such an early stage that the available data is well below the estimated inflection point t c , i.e., when the epidemic is still in the so-called exponential growth regime [13] . In this case, it is preferable to use the socalled generalized growth model [13, 22] , which is defined by the followingwhere the parameter q provides an interpolation between the sub-exponential regime (0 < q < 1) and the exponential one (q = 1). The solution of (4) iswhere e q (x) = [1 + (1 − q)x] 1/(1−q) is known in the physics literature as the q-exponential function [23, 24] . Here the parameter A is related to the initial condition, i.e., A = C(0) (1−q) , but we shall treat A as a free parameter to be determined from the fit of (5) to a given dataset.

Statistical Fits

All statistical fits in the paper were performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [25] to solve the respective non-linear least square optimization problems. In the case of the Richards model, there are four parameters, namely (r, K, α, t c ), to be determined; whereas for the q-exponential growth model we need to determine three parameters, (r, q, A).

Intervention Strategy and Efficiency

We define an intervention strategy in the context of the RGM by assuming that the corresponding actions applied to the actual population induce, at 5 All rights reserved.

Furthermore we impose the following boundary conditions at t 0 :andwhere C (t) = dC(t)/dt. Note that condition (8) takes into account, albeit indirectly, the fact that intervention measures take some time to affect the epidemic dynamics. In other words, the trend (i.e., the derivative) one sees at a given time t reflects in part the measures taken at some earlier time (or lack thereof). Thus, imposing continuity of the derivative of the epidemic curve at time t 0 in our 'intervention strategy' seeks to capture this delay effect. In our intervention model above, we assume that the net result of the action is to alter the parameters r and α of the Richards model at time t 0 . Of course, the difficult part is to estimate how a particular set of intervention measures (e.g., contact tracing and quarantine of contacts, social distancing, school closures, etc) would influence these parameters. Such an analysis is however beyond the scope of the present paper. Note furthermore that, as discussed above, the time t 0 is not the actual time of adoption of the intervention but rather the time at which the corresponding measures have started to affect the epidemics dynamics, as reflected in the number of cases. Nevertheless we shall for simplicity refer to t 0 as the intervention 'adoption time.' As defined in (6), an intervention strategy adopted at time t 0 can be viewed as a map (r, K, α, t c ) → (r , K , α , t c ) in the parameter space of the RGM, which results in the condition K /K < 1. Let us therefore define the intervention efficiency as the relative reduction in the total number of cases: η(t 0 ) = (K − K )/K, where it is assumed that η(t 0 ) > 0. Using conditions (7) and (8) in (3), one obtains that6 All rights reserved.

This will allow us to investigate how the efficiency of different strategies (i.e., for different choices of r and α ) varies as a function of the adoption time t 0 .

Fatality Curves

In Fig. 1(a) we show the cumulative number of deaths (red circles) attributed to COVID-19 for China, superimposed with the statistical fit of the RGM curve (black solid line), with the respective parameters shown in the inset of the figure. One sees from the figure that the fatality curve in this case, where the epidemic has apparently leveled off, is well adjusted by the RGM formula. This indicates that the evolution of the number of deaths in the COVID-19 epidemic can be effectively described with a dynamical model such as the Richards model. In Fig. 1(b) we show the cumulative deaths for Italy together with the respective RGM fit. Here again the RGM seems to be able to provide a reasonably good fit to the data. In this case, owing to the unavoidable incompleteness of the data, as the epidemics is still ongoing, there is considerably larger uncertainty in the parameters, particularly in the parameter K which represents an estimate of the total numbers of fatalities at the end of the epidemics.The good performance of the RGM exhibited in Fig. 1 , for the two countries where the COVID-19 pandemic is most advanced, encouraged us to apply the model to other countries at earlier stages of the epidemics. Here, however, care must be taken when estimating the model parameters from small time series, since it is well known that the Richards model [20, 21] and its variants [13] are susceptible to the problem of over fitting, owing to the redundancy of the parameters. This may lead, for example, to estimation of certain parameters that are outside of biologically or otherwise reasonable ranges [20] . For example, when applied to the number of infected cases in an epidemics the parameter α should be constrained within the interval (0, 1). Here we apply the RGM instead to the number of deaths, but we assume that the same constraint should be observed. In other words, fits that return α outside this interval are disregarded as not reliable. The unsuitability of the RGM is particularly serious when the available data does not encompass the inflection point t c [13] . As more data is accumulated, the model is expected to become more accurate. However, if strong measures are implemented towards mitigation or suppression, the dynamics of the epidemics is likely to change, so that different parameter models are required before and after the adoption of the countermeasures; see next section.Notwithstanding the above considerations, we observed that with the available data to date the GRM also provides good fits for several other countries, such as Spain and Iran, and less so for others, such as Germany. In the case of Spain and Iran, see Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), the last data point is sufficiently beyond the inflection point t c predicted by the model to lend some credibility to the model predictions. In contradistinction, in the case of Germany, see Fig. 2 (c), t c is slightly past the last data point, which makes the model predictions less reliable.In the case of Brazil, see Fig. 2 (d), the epidemic is still in such an early stage that the RGM is not justifiable. Here it is more advisable to use a simpler growth model, such as the q-exponential model described in Sec. 3. In Fig. 2(d) we show the fit of the q-exponential curve (5) to the Brazilian data, and one sees that the agreement is very good. From the fit parameters, see inset of Fig. 2(d) , we predict that the current time for doubling the number of deaths in Brazil is approximately 4 days.It should be emphasized, however, that besides China all countries considered above are still in the middle or early stages of the outbreak, so that any long-term prediction based on our model-or any other model for that matter-are only tentative at best.

Intervention Efficiency

As already mentioned, an intervention strategy in our model is defined by the two parameters r and α of the new Richards model after the adoption time t 0 ; see Eq. (6) . Recall that the parameter r in the RGM corresponds to the growth rate at the early stage of the epidemics; hence an early intervention should, in our language, seek to reduce this parameter, i.e., r < r. We shall therefore refer to this type of intervention as 'mitigation'. Similarly, at later stages of the epidemics one should try to increase the parameter α, i.e., we want to have α > α, so as to force the levelling off of the curve of cumulative cases as soon as possible after the intervention; this type of strategy will thus be said to be of the 'suppression' type. More specifically, in our model we can define two general sets of intervention strategies: i) mitigation, when we take α = α and r < r; and ii) suppression, meaning r = r and α > α. (More generally, a mixed strategy would modify both r and α, but for our purposes here it is preferable to study separately the effects of these two parameters.)In Fig. 3 we show the efficiency curve as a function of the adoption time t 0 for the two types of intervention strategies described above, as applied to the fatality curve of Italy shown in Fig. 1b. Here we have chosen the adoption time t 0 = 39, corresponding to the day before the last point included in the All rights reserved.

More specifically, in our intervention strategies we take r = 0.44 and α = 0.21 for t < t 0 , as obtained from the fit showed in Fig. 1(b) , whereas for t > t 0 we suppose two possible scenarios: mitigation and suppression. In the first type of scenario, shown in Fig. 3(a) , we set α = α and consider two mitigation strategies: i) action 1 with r = 0.5 (blue) and ii) action 2 with r = 0.6 (red). In the second scenario shown in Fig. 3 (a), we consider instead r = r and implement two suppression strategies: i) action 1 with α = 0.3 (red) and ii) action 2 with α = 0.9 (blue). Of course, only intervention strategies with t 0 > T , where T denotes the 'present time' (i.e., the time of the last data point) would be of practical value in an ongoing epidemics. (For the Italian data, T = 40.) Nevertheless, for t 0 < T the efficiency curve is still of some interest, as it indicates the relative reduction in fatalities that would have resulted had the corresponding strategy been adopted at some earlier time t 0 in the past. In all cases shown in Fig. 3 , we see that there is a quick decrease in efficiency as the adoption time increases. This confirms the commonly held view that there is only a narrow window of opportunity, after the outbreak of an epidemic, during which effective countermeasures can be taken that could have a significant impact in the final outcome.In Figure 4 we show the resulting fatality curves after we apply (at time t 0 =39) to the Italian data two different actions for each of our two classes of interventions, as compared to the no-action case (black curve). In Fig. 4(a) we show the complete fatality curves after implementing two different mitigation actions: i) action 1 with α = 0.29, η = 0.2 (red); and ii) action 2 with α = 0.62, η = 0.4 (blue). In Fig. 4(b) we show similar curves for two suppression actions: i) action 1 with r = 0.5, η = 0.1 (red); and ii) action 2 with r = 0.6, η = 0.25 (blue).

Conclusion

To summarize, this paper provides important insights into the time evolution of the accumulated number of deaths attributed to COVID-19, specially for countries, such as Italy, which are in the middle of the outbreak. Our modelling of the fatality curves is particularly relevant for the COVID-19 outbreak, because the actual number of infections remains largely unknown, so one is required to turn to proxy measures, such as mortality data, to gain a better understanding of the epidemics. The paper also shows how simple and soluble mathematical models can provide a rich theoretical framework in which to investigate some basic and deep aspects of epidemics dynamics. In particular, we have successfully applied the Richards growth model to describe the fatalities curves for four different countries, at different stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, namely China, Italy, Spain, Iran, and Germany. We also analysed the case of Brazil, which is in a much earlier stage of the outbreak, so here we resorted to a modified exponential growth model, also known as the generalized growth model. This model gave a good fit of the rising fatality curve of Brazil, from which we could estimate that as of this writing the time for doubling the number of fatalities from COVID-19 in Brazil is about 4 days.Another important contribution of the present study is to provide an analytical formula to quantitatively assess the efficiency of intervention measures in an ongoing epidemics. Interventions strategies are defined in the context of the Richards model as a change in the model parameters at some specified time, referred to as the intervention adoption time. Our formula shows that, in general, the efficiency of an intervention strategy decays quite quickly as the adoption time is delayed, thus showing that time is really of essence in containing an outbreak. 12 All rights reserved.

"Abstract

All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR or chest computer tomography (CT). The survivors were followed up until March 4,2020. Clinical data, including demographic characteristic, presentation, underlying illness, exposure history, laboratory examination, radiology and prognosis were enrolled and analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software. Results There were 197 adult discharged patients with COVID-19 in this study.Statistical analysis indicated that the average age was 55.94 years, and female patients were 99(50.3%).Those patients mainly resided in urban with exposure history in 2 weeks, while 7 medical staffs were infected. Fever (77.6%%), cough (43.6%) and weakness (14.7%) were the common symptoms. Leukocytes were mainly normal or decreased in 185 patients (92.9%), both lymphocytes and eosinophils were below normal range, the ratios were 56.9% and 50.3%, respectively. On the contrary, lactate dehydrogenases raised in 65 patients. C-reactive protein (72.4%) elevated in the most of patients. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 63.5%. Chest CT indicated that bilateral patchy shadows (69.0%) were the most common imaging manifestations.169(85.8%) patients recovered and transferred to a designated hospital for observation, and the others (14.2%) turned worst and died of acute respiratory failure. Conclusion COVID-19 infection with highly contagious have become a life-threaten public healthy problem, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was limited.Chest CT scan was recommended for the suspected patients. Furthermore, lymphocytopenia and eosinophils declining without leukocytes increasing may be considered as a useful evidence for the diagnosis.

Similar to the server acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory (MERS), 2019-nCoV can also cause serve acute respiratory syndrome [3] . Numerous patients can be cured effectively at the early stage, but some patients with COVID-19 may develop pulmonary edema, ARDS, or multiple organ failure, and even died abruptly [4] . Currently, researches about epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19 focused on the hospitalized patients [5] , but the discharged patients was still scarcely investigate. Therefore, this study was aimed to clarify the epidemiology and clinical features of discharged patients with COVID-19.

Methods

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Yichang Central people's hospital. All adult discharged patients with COVID-19 from Yichang Central People's Hospital and Yichang third People's Hospital from Jan 17 to Feb 26, 2020. Those patients with exposure histories were confirmed by chest CT scans or RT-PCR assays. Throat•swab or broncholveolr lvge fluid sample were collected from all the suspected patients at admission, and RT-PCR assays were performed at clinical laboratory. According to the 5th edition expert conference of Chinese healthy commission, those suspected patients presenting with lung imaging features also regard as clinically diagnosis-cases in Hubei province. ARDS was identified in accordance with the Berlin definition [6] , and acute kidney injury was verified according to Improve Global Outcome definition [7] . If the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers ascended to the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were displayed in echocardiography or electrocardiography (ECG), the patient was regarded as acute cardiac injury. The discharged criteria included that symptom disappeared and the lesions eliminated evidently in the chest CT. Furthermore, RT-PCR was negative continual 2 tests beyond 24 hours.After discharged from hospital, the patients went to the designated hospital for observation. All patients except deaths were monitored up to March 4, 2020.

Statistical Analysis

Clinical data, including date, ages, occupation, location, presentation, underlying diseases, laboratory test, RT-PCR ， chest CT, treatment and outcome was collected from electronic medical record(EMR) . If data was missing, we collected by direct communication with attending doctor. Then the data was inputted and analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software.Descriptive statistics were presented as median with interquartile range or frequency with percentage.

Epidemiology of COVID-19 patients in Yichang

A total of 197 adult discharged patients with COVID-19 were recruited in Yichang Central People's Hospital(101, 51.3%)and Yichang third people's hospital(86，48.7%).The first cases was a 65-years old woman from Wuhan on January15, 2020. The quantity of admitted patients increased sharply on the 15 days later, ascended to the peak on the February 2, and decreased obviously on 

Clinical features of adult discharged patients with COVID-19

Fever (153, 77.6%) was the most common presentations, following cough (89, 45.2%) and weakness (29, 14.7%), respectively. Other less common symptoms were sore throat (11, 5 .6%), shortness of breath (10, 5.1%), and muscle ache (9, 4.6%, Table 2 ). However, 3 patients without any complaints were detected by chest CT scan. Among all those patients, the average days from exposure to symptom onset was 6.14±9.27days. The longest incubation period was 55 days. 48 patients were accompanied with underlaying illness, including cardiovascular (24.4%) and cerebrovascular diseases (4.6%), endocrine system diseases (9.1%), chronic renal disease (1.5%), malignant tumor(1.5%), and digestive system diseases (1.0%), nervous system diseases. Considering vital sign and CT manifestations, 56 patients were admitted to intensive cure unite (ICU), and 141 patients were transferred to general isolation wards.

Laboratory examinations of adult discharged patients with COVID-19

The laboratory examination was underwent after admission, the blood routine results revealed that monocytes and platelet kept at normal range in numerous patients, leukocytes were at the normal range in 117 (59.4%) patients, and below the normal range in 66 (33.5%) patients. While lymphocytes decreased in many patients. Interestingly, eosinophils displayed a similar change tendency as lymphocytes, it decreased obviously over half of them. 44 (22.3%) patients had different degrees of liver function abnormality, with elevating of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Total bilirubin (TBIL) was above the normal range in 24(12.2%) patients, and direct bilirubin (DBIL) was above in 10 (5.1%) patient. Most of those patients had a abnormal myocardial zymogram, which indicated that creatine kinase was above in 10 (5.1%) patients, creatine kinase MB in 19 (9.6%) patients, and lactate dehydrogenase in 65(33.0%) patients. For the coagulation tests, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were at the normal range in the majority of patients, while fibrinogen was above the normal range in the 78 (39.6%) patients. D-dimmer was above the normal range in the 99 (47.2%) patients. 65 (33.0%) patients had different degrees of renal function damage, with elevating blood urea nitrogen or creatinine. Blood gas analysis was examined in 69 cases, and the results demonstrated that PaO 2 was decreased in the 28(40.5%) patients. Regarding the infection index, procalcitonin(PCT) mainly kept at the normal range. On the contrary, c-reative protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased in most of patients.Although RT-PCR was regarded the most accurate examinations for COVID-19, the sensitivity was limited. RT-PCR positive rate was 63.5%, the first test was 46.7%, and the second test was 11.2%. Comparing with PCR , almost all patients had been discover lesions in the chest CT scans, 32 (15.3%) patients displayed unilateral pneumonia, 136 (69.0%)patients displayed bilateral pneumonia, and only 25(12.7%) patients displayed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity(Table 4, Figure 2 ). injury and ARDS. Most patients were treated with antiviral drugs (Oseltamivir), 151(76.6%) patients received antibiotics(moxifloxacin and cefperazone-sulbactam), and several patients were treated with glucocorticoids (75, 38.1%) and immunoglobulin(52, 26.9%). Additionally, 81(41.1%) patients were treated with Chinese traditional medicine. By the end of Febururay 26, 28 (14.2%) patients had died, and 169(85.2%) patient was discharged and transferred to designated hospital for observation. The average of hospital stay was 15.08 days (Table 4 ).

Discussion

Coronavirus was a large RNA virus, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may induce sever respiratory syndrome, but the remains only caused mild upper respiratory infectious.2019-nCoV was a new subtype, with high incidence and rapid infection, it has spread widely in China and abroad, involving Italy, German, Korean, Iran, and Japan [8] [9] . At present, there was no vaccine and antiviral drugs against this disease. Therefore, Extensive studies of clinical features on COVID-19 have not only a better understanding of coronavirus transmission,but have also been key to detect quickly and accurately.COVID-19 diagnosis was based on exposure histories, symptoms, laboratory tests, chest CT and RT-PCR. In the early phase of the epidemic, almost all patients worked at or lived around the Huanan Seafood Whole Market in Wuhan [10] . With COVID-19 spread rapidly in Hubei province, Wuhan-related exposures was regarded as a key criterion. Previous retrospective research demonstrated that 86% cases had a Wuhan-related exposures history [11] . Similarly, our study revealed most of infected patients lived around Xiling strict, because of many residents working at China Gezhouba Group Corporation, returning from Wuhan. The common symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever, fatigue and cough, some patients may present with abdominal symptoms [12] . While a few patients without any symptoms were detected accidentally by chest CT [11] .Thus, it is difficult to suspect the disease without auxiliary examinations. The significant of laboratory examinations was blood routine, the results suggested leukocytes were mainly normal or decreased, and lymphocytes reduced evidently in many COVID-19 patients [13] . A recent research indicated that lymphocytes,especially CD3 + lymphocytes and CD45 + lymphocytes, decreased significantly in comparison with non-COVID patients, while there was no significantly difference in quantities and proportions of neutrophils and monocytes [14] .Results of this analysis showed lymphocytes and eostinophils decreased obviously without leukocytes increasing in most patients, and neutrophils,monocytes and platelet mainly kept at normal range,it was consistent with previous reports. In term of chest CT, the typical image features were peripheral, subpleural ground glass opacities in the lower lobes. However, a study of CT manifestations demonstrated that it was approximately 14% COVID-19 patients with atypical CT features [15] . Real time RT-PCR was considered a standard assessment for COVID-19，but the sensitivity was lower than chest CT scans, RT-PCR was 71%, chest CT scans reached 98% [16] .Thus, it was essential to perform chest CT for detecting the suspected patients.As described before, there was currently no clinical approved antiviral drugs and vaccine for coronavirus infections except for supportive treatment [17] .

Oxygen inhalation was important to avoid to ARDS for the COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia. In this study, 76.6% patients received oxygen by nasal catheter, and 90% received antiviral therapy, and 38.1% received glucocorticoids. CDC reported that the case-fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 the overall case--fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 was 2.3% in confirmed cases, and CFR among critical cases may reach 49.0% [11] . Nevertheless, most of patients were still treated in the hospital. Another retrospective study suggest the CFR was about 11% [13] . Statistical analysis of this study found that the CFR was 14.2%, and most of them were over 70 year-old patients accompanying with chronic illness. In the past one month, numerous effective measures, including blocking cities and roads, closing supermarket, monitoring temperature, building a new hospital and setting up medical assistance team, have been carried out to controlling infection source, preventing transmission and reducing death. Until now, there was no new confirmed patients for 13 days,and hospitalized patients decreased sharply.In conclusion, this retrospective study, based on clinical data, revealed that COIVD-19 mainly infected in older people with comorbidities, and may cause acute severe respiratory syndrome.Chest CT was key to screen those suspected patients, and lymphocytopenia and eosnophils declining without leukocytes increasing may be regarded as an novel evidence in the dignosis of COVID-19.

"Abstract

The outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease has become pandemic. To be more effectively controlling the disease, it is critical to set up an optimal quarantine period so that about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be retained for isolation. At the moment, the WHO-established quarantine period is 14 days based on previous reports which had studied small sizes of hospitalized cases (10 and ~100, respectively), however, over 80% of adult-and 95% of child-cases were not necessary to stay in hospitals, and therefore, had not been hospitalized. Therefore, we are questioning if the current-inferred median incubation time is representative for the whole Covid-19 population, and if the current quarantine period is optimal.We compiled and analyzed the patient-level information of 2015 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases including 99 children in 28 Chinese provinces. This cohort represents a wide-range spectrum of Covid-19 disease with both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases.The full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. There were 6 (0.13%) symptom-free cases including 4 females with a median age of 25.5 years and 2 males with a median age of 36 years. The median incubation period of both male and female adults was similar (7-day) but significantly shorter than that (9-day) of child cases (P=0.02). This cohort contained 4 transmission generations, and incubation periods of the cases between generations were not significantly different, suggesting that the virus has not been rapidly adapted to human beings. Interestingly, incubation periods of 233 cases (11.6%) were longer than the WHO-established quarantine period (14 days). Data modeling suggested that if adults take an extra 4-day or 7-day of isolation (i.e., a quarantine period of 18 or 21 days), 96.2% or 98.3%, respectively, of the people who are developing symptoms will be more effectively quarantined.

","Introduction

The outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (Covid-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. Understanding the characteristics of the incubation period is crucial to design public health efforts for effectively isolating the cases and contacts to control outbreaks of Covid-19.SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by either respiratory droplets, contaminated surfaces, and objects or an oral-fecal transmission route to lead gastrointestinal tract infection 1 Because outbreaks are being occurred in many countries, it is critical to analyze real-time data of the Covid-19 cases to gain insights to inform public-health intervention strategies for managing and preventing the disease. One of the key issues for controlling Covid-19 is to set up a suitable quarantine period which could capture about 95% of the cases developing symptoms so that the practice of isolations will be more effective and save public health resources. Thus far, the incubation time studies have been focused on hospitalized patients who were highly selected based on medical conditions, and further, sample sizes for inferring incubation times were small, for example, 10 and ~100, respectively 3, 4 . However, the majority (i.e., about 80% of adults and 95% of children) of the Covid-19 cases were not necessary to be hospitalized, and therefore, had not been hospitalized due to their mild conditions. Here, we asked if the median incubation time inferred from the hospitalized patients are representative for the whole population of Covid-19, and if the current quarantine period determined based on hospitalized patients is optimal.To answer these questions, we manually curated the patient-level data from the case reports on official websites of China's provincial public health agencies. This cohort represents a general population of Covid-19 cases without a selection based on medical conditions. The cohort contained 2015 cases including 99 children who had symptom onsets between January 1, 2020, and February 25, 2020. All the curated cases contained exposure, onset, and diagnosis dates. We analyzed the incubation time for the Covid-19 population containing both hospitalized and nonhospitalized cases.. CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint we read the case reports in Chinese to curate age, sex, demographic information (i.e., name of the provinces and cities), dates of exposures, symptom onset and diagnosis (i.e., confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 infection through laboratory-tests), when available. The patient data were curated by XJ, WXC, and YCC who are native Chinese speakers and translated the summary of each patient into English. To make sure the data accuracy, the curations have been cleaned and checked 4 times by four other researchers, YWN, XL, LL, and EW. We mainly focused on the cases which were allowed to inferring incubation time. Among 4567 cases, after removing the cases which did not have exposure dates, or whose exposure dates were not sure, we obtained 2015 cases whose incubation times could be inferred. Because the information of Covid-19 cases in Hubei province including Wuhan, the city at the center of the epidemic, was not publicly available, this cohort included only non-Hubei cases.Study design and data We curated the patient-level data as described above and characterized patient baseline information such as incubation periods. All the data in this study have been deidentified and publicly available through local Chinese health agencies, therefore, patient consent and ethics approval was not required.

Statistical analysis

The incubation period of a Covid-19 case is the time between infectious exposure and symptom onset. Over 2,000 cases had sufficient information for inferring incubation periods. Most of which had clear records for the dates of exposures and symptom onsets. For imported cases (e.g., travelers from Wuhan city), the exposure dates were defined as the dates of leaving the epicentral cities such as Wuhan. For the cases, who had been quarantined and monitored for the disease, the diagnosed dates were set as the dates for their symptom onsets. χ2 tests and t-tests were used for statistical analysis using R, a free software environment for statistical computing. We considered p values of less than 0.05 to be significant..

RESULTS

We collected patient-level data for 2015 Covid-19 cases reported between January 1 and February 25, 2020 (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1) . 887 (44.0%) cases were female adults with a median age of 46 years (IQR 41.5-50.5), 1029 (51.0%) were male adults and the median age was 45 years (IQR 40.5-50.5), and 99 (4.9 %) cases were children with the median age was 9 years (IQR 7-11) with a boy-to-girl ratio of 1.3:1. 774 (38.4%) were imported cases, most reported a travel history to Wuhan (133, 17.2%) or were residents of Wuhan (641, 82.8%), while 240 (11.9%) of the imported case were either the residents or returning travelers from non-Wuhan regions.The incubation period is essential in the control of infectious diseases. To halt a pandemic, a suitable quarantine period should be set by investigating incubation periods. Thus, understanding the characteristics of the incubation period is crucial to design public health efforts. In this cohort, the full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. Both male and female adults had their median incubation periods of 7-day, which is 1.8-day longer than those in other reports 3,4 (see discussion). However, a similar result was released in the recent news from the Chinese Medical Association that the median incubation periods were 5-7 days 5 . The median incubation period (9-day) of children were significantly longer than those of adults (t-test P = 0.02). For adults, the incubation periods for the majority (66.5%) of the cases were 1-9 days: most of them (57.6% and 52.0% for males and females, respectively) had 1-5 days incubation. Importantly, we found that the incubation periods of 11.5% (n=233, 123 and 105 were male and female, respectively) of the cases were longer than 14 days, the current WHO-set 14-day quarantine period. These results agree with a recent study which also reported 12.7% (n=13) of the cases whose incubation periods were longer than 14 days 4 . These data suggested that the official 14-day quarantine period only captured 88.5% of the population developing Covid-19.However, among the 233 cases with longer incubation periods, most (n=198, 85.0%) had 15-21 days of incubation periods, suggesting that implementation of the 21-day quarantine period for everybody will capture 98.3% of the cases. However, we knew that fewer children were infected, .

Based on Fig 1, we concluded that if adults take an extra 7 days for quarantine, we will capture 98.3% of the cases. Data modeling also showed that a 17-day or 18-day quarantine period will capture 94.8% and 96.2%, respectively, of the cases.The incubation period of 2.0% (n=19 and 20 for male and female adults, respectively) of the total cases was 0-day, while some cases were transmitted by having contacts with Covid-19 patients who had not developed symptom onset yet, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might be contagious (i.e., is shedding virus) during incubation periods, and these patients could be more susceptible to this virus. There were 6 (0.13%) symptom-free cases including 4 females with a median age of 25.5 years (IQR 24.0-27.0) and 2 males with a median age of 36 years (IQR 24.0-48.0). These symptom-free cases were much younger than the majority of the patients.The fecal-oral transmission has been found in Covide-19 cases 1 . Food sharing in lunch/dinner parties could facilitate fecal-oral transmission. Interestingly, the incubation time (9-day IQR 7.75-10.25) of the cases transmitted by lunch/dinner party contacts was significantly longer than others (P=0.03), suggesting that oral transmission via sharing food had longer incubation periods than transmitting via respiratory droplets.There were 4 generations of transmitted cases based on contact tracing information. The Wuhanimported cases were defined as the 1-generation cases, while the 2-generation cases included both non-Wuhan imported cases, and new cases which were transmitted directly by a 1generation case or an unknown cause. The 3-generation cases were the ones transmitted directly by a 2-generation case. The incubation time was not significantly different between the patients of transmission generations, suggesting that the virus is not rapidly adapted to humans.

Discussion

The incubation period is essential in making intervention strategies to control infectious diseases.Thus, understanding of incubation time of a wide-range spectrum of Covid-19 for establishing an optimal quarantine period is crucial to designing public health interventions. Two recent studies have reported incubation periods for Covid-19 cases 3, 4 , but only for the hospitalized patients, . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036533 doi: medRxiv preprint who were highly selected and represented only 20% of adult-and 5% of child-cases of the general Covid-19 population. Further, the sample size (about 100 and 10 cases, respectively) for inferring incubation periods were small in these studies. Here, we manually curated a Covid-19 cohort containing baseline and incubation information of nearly 2,000 patients including 99 children. This cohort included both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases. By analyzing this cohort, we characterized the incubation times of Covid-19 adults and children as well, and examined the effectiveness of the 14-day quarantine period.The median incubation period for adults in this cohort was 7-day, which was longer than 5-5.2 days reported previously 3, 4 . Recently, the Chinese Medical Association also found that the coronavirus median incubation period was 5-7 days 5 . Kids had an incubation period of 9-day and significantly longer than adults. Based on previous studies, WHO has set a 14-day quarantine period for Covid-19. However, we found that that the incubation periods of 11.5% (n=233) of the cases were longer than 14 days, meaning that the current quarantine policy only stops 88% of the cases for virus spreading. This finding is similar to another report showing that 13 (12.7%) cases had their incubation time longer than 14 days 4 . In general, a quarantine period that retains about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be more effective 6 . Thus, we further analyzed the subset (n=233) and found that 98.7% and 97.9%, respectively, of the men and women cases who are developing the disease, will be quarantined, if everybody or adults alone, respectively, take an extra 7-day of isolation (i.e., a quarantine period of 21 days). If taking a quarantine period of 17-day or 18-day, 94.8% and 96.2%, respectively, of the cases developing symptoms will be successfully quarantined.As the outbreak is fast-moving in the world, based on this analysis we recommended that an extension of adults' quarantine period to 17 or 21 days could be more effective. Of note, the outbreak occurred during the Chinese New Year holiday, further the holiday period had been extended to another 10 days 7 . Moreover, until now (as of March 15, 2020) schools and universities have been still shut down. Thus, due to the implementation of the aggressive social distancing measures many people in China have been isolated for more than 60 days..

Furthermore, some cases start to transmit this virus before the symptom onset. This is very different from the transmission patterns of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), for which transmission rarely occurred until after the 4-5 days after symptom onset 8 . When a virus has infectiousness before symptom onset, control of outbreaks using contact tracing and isolation is more challenging 9 .Interestingly, the cases transmitted by lunch/dinner party contacts had a 2-day longer incubation period than the cases transmitted via respiratory droplets. The Chinese style dish-and foodsharing during lunch/dinner parties can easily contaminant the shared dishes by virus-carriers and thus, could facilitate oral transmission for leading gastrointestinal tract infection, which has been reported as a transmission means for Covide-19 1 . It has been reported that 10% of patients presented with diarrhea and nausea 1-2 days before the development of fever and respiratory symptoms 10, 11 . These observations explained why the cases transmitted by lunch/dinner party contacts had significantly longer incubation periods. Therefore, the early signs of the cases transmitted by lunch/dinner parties could be diarrhea and nausea which often develop before fever and respiratory symptoms in these patients.

Limitations

Several limitations of this study are the following: (1) the cohort did not include patient-level information from the patients in Hubei province including Wuhan city, because they were exhaust-dealing with the outbreak and could not make the information in their official websites.(2) all the cases are Chinese patients.Acknowledgments: EW and XJ designed the project.

"Abstract

The outbreak of coronavirus disease in China caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus 24 continually lead to worldwide human infections and deaths. It is currently no specific viral protein 25targeted therapeutics yet. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving 26 multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information of SARS-27CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the 2.7 Å crystal 28 structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. 29 Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-30 terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. 31 Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique 32 potential RNA binding pocket alongside the b-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro binding 33 studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid 34 protein N-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to 35 SARS-CoV-2. 36

translates into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and encodes most of the non-structural 50 proteins (nsp). The rest parts of virus genome encode accessory proteins and four essential 51 structural proteins, including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) 52 protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein 1, 2 . Current antiviral drugs developed to treat coronavirus 53 (CoV) infections primarily target S protein, the 3C-like (3CL) and papain-like (PLP) proteases 3, 4 . 54Because mutant viruses in the S protein is prone to escape the targeted therapeutic with 55 different host-cell receptor binding patterns 4 , as well as antibody-dependent enhancement 56 (ADE) effects of S protein antibodies are found in MERS coronavirus 5 , there are several limitations 57 on targeting S protein for antiviral approaches.

It plays many pivotal roles in forming helical ribonucleoproteins 63 during packaging the RNA genome, regulating viral RNA synthesis during replication, 64 transcription and modulating infected cell metabolism [6] [7] [8] . The primary functions of N protein are 65 binding to the viral RNA genome, and packing them into a long helical nucleocapsid structure 66 or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex 9,10 . In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that N protein 67 bound to leader RNA, and was critical for maintaining highly ordered RNA conformation suitable 68 for replicating, and transcribing the viral genome 7,11 . More studies implicated that N protein 69 regulated host-pathogen interactions, such as actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, 70 and apoptosis [12] [13] [14] . The N protein is also a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein 71 during infection, capable of inducing protective immune responses against SARS-CoV and 72 At present work, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N-terminal 87 domain (termed as SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD), as a model for understanding the molecular 88 interactions that govern SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD binding to ribonucleotides. Compared with other 89 solved CoVs N-NTD, we characterized the specificity surface electrostatic potential features of 90 SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD. Additionally, we further demonstrated the unique RNA binding site 91 characteristics. Our findings will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral N 92 protein and viral replication in SARS-CoV-2, and highly related virus SARS-CoV. 93

Sequence features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 132

It is reported that the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947, Wuhan-Hu-1 coronavirus) 133 is 29.9 kb in length, similarly to 27.9 kb SARS-CoV and 30.1 kb MERS-CoV genome 32,33 (Fig. 1A) .

Briefly, 47-173 residues of SARS-CoV-2 N 152 protein were constructed, expressed and purified as described protocol (Materials and Methods). 153The structure of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD was determined by molecular replacement using the 154 SARS-CoV N-NTD structure (PDB:2OG3) as the search model 24 . The final structure was refined 155 to R-factor and R-free values of 0.26 and 0.29, respectively. The complete statistics for data 156 collection, phasing and refinement are presented in Table 1 . Unlike to SARS-CoV N-NTD crystals 157 packing modes (monoclinic form at 2OFZ, cubic form at 2OG3) 24 , SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD crystal 158shows orthorhombic crystal packing form with four N-NTD monomers in one asymmetry unit 159 ( Fig. 2A) . Although lacks of evidence for real RNP organization in the mature virions, the 160 differences in the crystal packing patterns may implicate other potential contacts in SARS-CoV-161 2 RNP formation process. All four monomers in one asymmetric unit of the SARS-CoV-2 N-162 NTD crystal structure shared similar right-handed (loops)-(b-sheet core)-(loops) sandwiched 163 structure, as conserved among the CoVs N-NTD (Fig. 2B) . The b-sheet core is consisted of five 164 antiparallel b-strands with a single short 310 helix just before strand b2, and a protruding b-165 hairpin between strands b2 and b5. The b-hairpin is functionally important for CoV N-NTD, 166 implicated in mutational analysis of amino acid residues for RNA binding 29 (Fig. 2C) . The SARS-167CoV-2 N-NTD is enriched in aromatic and basic residues, folding into a hand shape resembles 168 with basic fingers that extend far beyond the b-sheet core, a basic palm, and an acidic wrist (Fig.  169   2D) . 170

The most conserved residues distribute on the basic palm region (Fig. 3A, blue and  174 green region), while the less conserved residues locate in basic fingers and acidic wrist region 175 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.977876 doi: bioRxiv preprint SARS-CoV-2 one (Fig. 4A) . The N-terminal tail movement contributed to the change of N-NTD 213 surface charge distribution, at which nucleotide binding cavity became easier to accessible in 214 SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD ( Fig. 4B and C) . The second difference is on phosphate group binding site, 215 which SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD have larger sidechain residues (55 TA 56) compared with HCoV-216 OC43 N-NTD equivalents (67 SG 68) (Fig. 4D) . Structural superimposition suggested additional 217 polar properties of Thr 55 and Ala 56 in SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD may increase the steric clash with 218 ribonucleotide phosphate moiety ( Fig. 4E and F) . The third difference is on the edge of 219 nitrogenous base recognized hydrophobic pocket, where SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD had Arg 89 220 residues compared with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD Tyr 102 equivalents (Fig. 4G) . The change of these 221 residues sidechain may lead to dramatic decreasing of non-polar properties and increasing of 222 polar properties in the nitrogenous base binding site ( Fig. 4H and I) . To evaluate these different 223 observations in our structure, Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis experiments were next 224 performed to assess the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with all four kinds of 225 ribonucleotide AMP/UMP/CMP/GMP. Intriguingly, all ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate, 226 excepted for GMP (KD value is 8 mM), shown little binding signals in assays (Fig. S4) . Taken 227 together, the above results suggested a potential distinct RNA binding patterns between SARS-228CoV-2 N protein with HCoV-OC43 N protein. 229

"Abstract

This paper focuses on the formulation of a deterministic 2019-nCov transmission model by considering the exposed and recovered populations with immunity. The scenario of the simulation is depicted based on the patient zero in Malaysia. The transmission model is found to be able to predict the next confirmed case given a single case introduced in a fully susceptible population. The mathematical model is developed based on the SEIR model which has susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered populations. The system of equations which were obtained were solved numerically and the simulation results were analyzed. The analysis includes the impact of the disease if no control is taken.

","Introduction

On 31 December 2019, China notified an outbreak pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City to the World Health Organization (WHO) and it had been identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In January 2020, several cases were confirmed outside the Mainland of China and hence WHO has declared 2019-nCoV as a global health emergency. Approximately one month since the notification to the WHO, there were 24,663 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases worldwide where 29 countries were affected. January 25 in Malaysia, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported the first three confirmed cases of whom are of China nationality. The three infected patients were reported to have entered Malaysia from Singapore of which two days earlier, a confirmed case was notified by the Singapore authorities. The first infected Malaysian was reported on February 4. Based on the patient mobility report prior to the notification, it was noted that he was in Singapore for a week starting on January 16, 2020 to attend an international conference where some of the conference delegates were reported to have come from China. It was noted that this patient's symptoms appear on 23 January and he only seek for treatment on January 29 and was referred to the Sungai Buloh Hospital on February 2.The current understanding of the 2019-nCoV is that there is a possibility that the novel coronavirus can be asymptomatic. Thus, this paper aims to add insights into the epidemiology of 2019-nCoV by simulating the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV in Malaysia when one local human was infected.

Model Formulation

The transmission model was formulated based on the epidemiology aspects of the disease:(a) In this study, Malaysia's population is divided into the SEIR compartmental model which consists of four compartments: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I) and Recovered (R). The total population of Malaysia is denoted as N and it is assumed that the population is homogeneous. It is assumed that initially the total population is susceptible, hence S0 = N.(b) Based on the growing number of cases worldwide within a short period, the disease is assumed to spread sufficiently fast that the birth and the natural death rates can be considered as negligible in the model..

Figure 1 SEIR Diagram

The compartmental model is thus depicted in Figure 1 . Since the patient zero may be infectious and was mobile and freely interacting then susceptible human becomes exposed with the disease at a transmission rate f. Once exposed, the incubation period starts and then after the period ends then those exposed moves to the Infected compartment at a rate c and when they recovered from the disease then they will move to the Recovered compartment at a rate k. However, there are some infected cases who may die due to the disease with the given rate of d.The differential equations (equations (1) -(4)) which describe the dynamics of the 2019-nCoV in human populations are formulated based on the compartmental diagram described earlier in Figure 1 .!'The descriptions of the parameters and their values used for the simulation is shown in Table 1 . 1 c Incubation Period 6.5 [2] f Transmission rate of I to S 1.07 [3] 1 k Infectious Period 3.6 [3] d Death rate of 2019-nCoV 0.03 Estimated based on current statistics .

Model Simulation

First confirmed infectious Malaysian is onset on January 23, 2020 when he came back from Singapore [4] . Hence the initial time (t0) is set to January 23, 2020 and I0 is 1. E0 and R0 are assigned to 0. Matlab 2019 is used in this study to simulate the SEIR model formulated using the parameter values listed in Table 1 . Figure 2 depicts the simulation of the SEIR model for the first ten days since the on-set date. Based on the result, the number of cases will increase to two persons which indicate that the second case will be confirmed on t = 8.74 which is approximately on the 9 th day after on-set date of the first case, that is on the 1 st February 2020.

Figure 3 Simulation of SEIR model in 300 days

In figure 3 , the simulation is run for 300 days and it is observed that if there is no control measure taken then the disease will run its course from the on-set date of the first case until day t = 100 when the maximum number of infected cases are reached. This means that if there is no control intervention imposed on the situation then the disease will be able to infect more than 3 million in the country.

Conclusion

The 2019-nCoV SEIR model was simulated using the parameters values obtained from trusted sources. The model is found to be accurate as it is able to predict the second confirmed case in Malaysia as reported on February 7 by the MoH [5] . One of the parameters used, namely the incubation period, was actually estimated by [2] based on 88 confirmed cases detected outside of Wuhan, China. Our simulation has managed to verify the proposed incubation period of 6.5 days at which according to the MoH report [5] , the second case has developed symptoms on the 1 st February 2020 which is in agreement with the prediction of our model. We have also shown through the simulation the seriousness of the spread of the disease if there is no control measure is taken..

"Abstract

The ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia in China and beyond is associated with a novel 28 coronavirus, provisionally termed 2019-nCoV. This outbreak has been tentatively associated 29 with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of 30 zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of 31 any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the 32 identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in 33 anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin 34 associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, 35 including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The 36 discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV 37 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel 38 human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.

"Abstract

Neuromodulation plays a critical role in brain function in both health and disease. New optical tools, and their validation in biological tissues, are needed that can image neuromodulation with high spatial and temporal resolution, which will add an important new dimension of information to neuroscience research. Here, we demonstrate the use of a catecholamine nanosensor with fluorescent emission in the 1000-1300 nm near-infrared window to measure dopamine transmission in ex vivo brain slices. These near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) represent a broader class of nanosensors that can be synthesized from non-covalent conjugation of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) with single strand oligonucleotides. We show that nIRCats can be used to detect catecholamine efflux in brain tissue driven by both electrical stimulation or optogenetic stimulation. Spatial analysis of electrically-evoked signals revealed dynamic regions of interest approximately 2 microns in size in which transients scaled with simulation intensity. Optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic terminals produced similar transients, whereas optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic terminals showed no effect on nIRCat signal. Bath application of nomifensine prolonged nIRCat fluorescence signal, consistent with reuptake blockade of dopamine. We further show that the chemically synthetic molecular recognition elements of nIRCats permit measurement of dopamine dynamics in the presence of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists. These nIRCat nanosensors may be advantageous for future use because i) they do not require virus delivery, gene delivery, or protein expression, ii) their near-infrared fluorescence facilitates imaging in optically scattering brain tissue and is compatible for use in conjunction with other optical neuroscience tool sets, iii) the broad availability of unique near-infrared colors have the potential for simultaneous detection of multiple neurochemical signals, and iv) they are compatible with pharmacology.

","Main

The catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine are neuromodulators known to play an important role in learning and attention and are implicated in multiple brain disorders. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Dopamine, in particular, is thought to play a critical role in learning 6 , motivation 7, 8 , and motor control 9 , and aberrations in dopamine neurotransmission are implicated in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders including Parkinson's disease 10 , schizophrenia 11 , and addiction. 12 Neuromodulatory neurotransmission is thought to occur on a broader spatial scale than classic neurotransmission, which is largely mediated by synaptic release of the amino acids glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. In synaptic glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, neurotransmitter concentrations briefly rise in the synaptic cleft to mediate local communication between the pre-and postsynaptic neurons through the rapid activation of ligand-gated ion channels. 13 In contrast, neuromodulators (catecholamines, neuropeptides) may diffuse beyond the synaptic cleft and act via extrasynaptically-expressed metabotropic receptors. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Thus, modulatory neurotransmitter activity extends beyond single synaptic partners and enables small numbers of neurons to modulate the activity of broader networks. 20 The absence of direct change in ionic flux across cell membranes, which is measurable using available tools like electrophysiology or genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs), has necessitated the use of methods borrowed from analytical chemistry such as microdialysis and amperometry to study the dynamics of neuromodulation. However, spatial limitations of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and spatial and temporal limitations of microdialysis currently make it difficult to interpret how neuromodulators affect the plasticity or function of target neural populations at behaviorally relevant spatiotemporal scales.Ideally, to understand how neuromodulation sculpts brain activity, we need to develop tools that can optically report modulatory neurotransmitter concentrations in the brain extracellular space (ECS) in a manner that is compatible with pharmacology and other available tools to image neural structure and activity, and minimally interferes with the underlying biology. This goal motivates our effort to design an optical probe that can report extracellular catecholamine dynamics with high spatial and temporal fidelity within a unique near-infrared spectral profile. In this work, we describe the design, characterization, and implementation of a nanoscale near-infrared (nIR) non-genetically encoded fluorescent reporter that allows precise measurement of catecholamine dynamics in brain tissue. This technology makes use of a single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) noncovalently functionalized with single strand (GT)6 oligonucleotides to form the nearinfrared catecholamine nanosensor (nIRCat). nIRCats respond to dopamine with ΔF/F of up to 24-fold in the fluorescence emission window of 1000-1300 nm 48 , a wavelength range that has shown utility for non-invasive through-skull imaging in mice. 21 First, we show in vitro characterization of the nanosensor's specificity for the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine, and demonstrate its insensitivity to GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. Second, we use ex vivo brain slices containing the dorsal striatum to demonstrate that nIRCats exhibit a fractional change in fluorescence that has the dynamic range and signalto-noise ratio to report dopamine efflux in response to brief electrical or optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic terminals. Next, optogenetic stimulation of this preparation is also used to demonstrate the selectivity of the nIRCat nanosensor response to dopaminergic over glutamatergic terminal stimulation. In both stimulation contexts, we show that bath application of dopamine receptor antagonist sulpiride and agonist quinpirole modulates nIRCat signals in a manner consistent with predicted effects of presynaptic D2 autoreceptor manipulation. Finally, we show that the presence of a dopamine reuptake inhibitor yields a prolonged nIRCat fluorescent signal indicating that the sensors report a change in the time course of dopamine diffusion and reuptake in striatal brain tissue. These data indicate that nIRCats provide a unique synthetic tool compatible with pharmacology to interrogate the release, diffusion, and reuptake of neuromodulators in neural tissue.

A Near-Infrared Dopamine and Norepinephrine Nanosensor

We report near-infrared fluorescent catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) that enable imaging of extrasynaptic catecholamines and their release and re-uptake dynamics in the ECS of brain tissue. Using a previously established nanosensor generation platform 22, 23 , synthetic bio-mimetic polymers were pinned onto the surface of intrinsically near-infrared fluorescent single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT). The resulting non-covalent nanometerscale conjugate produced the catecholamine-selective nIRCat. In in vitro solution phase experiments (Methods), nIRCats exhibited a maximal change in fluorescence (ΔF/F) of up to 24 (Figure 1b, 1c) with a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude, reporting detectable fluorescence changes from 10 nM to 100 µM dopamine concentration ( Figure S1 ). nIRCats were also sensitive to norepinephrine with a maximal response of ∆F/F=35 and a similar dynamic range ( Figure S1 ). We found that nIRCats are insensitive to GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine ( Figure 1c ) and can report fluctuations in dopamine concentration in the presence of ascorbic acid, which is present in cerebrospinal fluid ( Figure S1 ). Singlemolecule imaging revealed that the nIRCat signal in response to repeated perfusions of 10 µM dopamine was reversible upon exposure, an important feature for measuring neuromodulator kinetics ( Figure S2 ). In previous work, we performed stochastic simulations that suggest nIRCats have sufficient sensitivity to detect physiologically relevant fluctuations in dopamine concentration in brain tissue arising from the activity of a single dopaminergic terminal, which can briefly exceed concentrations of 1 µM from the release site in a distance-dependent manner. 24

Imaging of electrical stimulation-evoked dopamine release in acute striatal brain slices

To determine the efficacy of nIRCats for imaging dopamine in brain tissue, we used brain slices from the dorsal striatum of the mouse. Given that the dorsal striatum is densely innervated by dopaminergic projections from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) but lacks innervation from neurons that release norepinephrine (NE) 25 , we leveraged nIRCats capacity to serve as a dopamine sensor in the striatum. The majority of neurons within the striatum are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) with a minority fraction of interneuron populations that include GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons. 26 Glutamatergic inputs from the cortex and thalamus are the major drivers of MSN activity and dopaminergic terminals in close proximity to these inputs are thought to play an important role in modulating the activity of MSNs and plasticity at striatal synapses. 27 Due to the composition of local axons, intrastriatal electrical stimulation is predicted to drive the release of a mix of neurotransmitter including GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, and dopamine, but negligible amounts of other catecholamines like norepinephrine.Coronal mouse brain slices were prepared as described previously. 28 Slices were subsequently incubated with 2 mg/L nIRCats for 15 minutes to enable sensors to diffuse into the brain tissue ( Figure 2a ). Slices were subsequently rinsed to remove excess nIRCats and incubated in standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for another 15 minutes before imaging. This method, modified from Godin et al. 29 who demonstrated that SWNT localize in the ECS of acute brain slices, enabled even and widespread labeling of the coronal slice, including the dorsal striatum ( Figure 2c ). Imaging of nIRCat fluorescence modulation in dorsal striatum was accomplished with a custom-built visible and nearinfrared microscope to enable concurrent imaging of both visible (400 nm -750 nm) and near-infrared (750 nm -1700 nm) wavelengths on the same detector ( Figure 2b ). Briefly, a 785 nm laser for excitation of nIRCats and mercury bulb for generating brightfield images were directed onto the back focal plane of an epifluorescence upright microscope, and imaging channels were selected using a sliding mirror. Serially, either brightfield or nearinfrared images were collected on a Ninox Vis-SWIR 640 broadband camera (Raptor Photonics) with appropriate dichroic filters (Methods) and a 60X water dipping objective (Nikon) providing an imaging field of 178 µm by 142 µm, containing hundreds of dopaminergic terminals.

(b) Schematic of visible/near-infrared microscope. A 785 nm CW laser is beam-expanded and co-aligned with a mercury vapor lamp and directed into the objective with dichroic filter cubes. Emitted photons are filtered through a 900 nm long-bass filter and are relayed onto the sensor of a broadband InGaAs camera that is sensitive to both visible and near-infrared wavelengths. (c) Dorsomedial striatum from mouse acute slice imaged in brightfield (top) and near-infrared (bottom) after tissue nanosensor loading. Scale bars = 10 µm.To investigate striatal neuromodulator release with temporal control of tissue stimulation, we used a bipolar stimulating electrode to evoke terminal release within the dorsomedial striatum (stimulus protocol: 3 millisecond wide single square pulses, over 5 biological replicates). We found a single pulse could elicit a nIRCat signal transient, and that increasing the strength of the stimulus led to larger evoked changes in nIRCat F/F signal, (ΔF/F)max 0.1 mA = 0.047 ± 0.025; 0.3 mA = 0.122 ± 0.026; and 0.5 mA = 0.2 ± 0.033; mean ± s. d., n=5 for all measurements, p=0.008 between 0.1 mA vs. 0.3 mA, p=0.008 between 0.3 mA vs. 0.5 mA) (Figure 3b ).To further test if evoked nIRCat signals tracked striatal dopamine release and reuptake kinetics, we investigated the effect of nomifensine, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor that slows the clearance of dopamine from the ECS by competitively binding to dopamine transporters (DATs). Addition of 10 µM nomifensine to the bath yielded nIRCat signal with higher peak fluorescence modulation ((∆F/F)max = 0.108 ± 0.029 vs. 0.189 ± 0.023; mean ± s. d., n=3, p=0.0178) and a prolonged fluorescent signal compared to signals obtained in ACSF from the same field of view (decay time constant, =2.43 ± 0.24 s vs. 10 .95 ± 1.15 s; mean ± s. d., n=3, p=0.0002) (Figure 3a top vs. bottom row, Figure 3c ).

Inset: An example of nIRCat experimental data (blue dots) fitted to first order kinetics (red line) to compute decay time constants (). To identify nIRCat fluorescence change hotspots (i.e., regions of high ∆F/F), we analyzed our video-rate acquisitions using a custom-built program that accounted for background fluorescence and identified regions with fluctuations in fluorescence intensity in the poststimulation epoch (see Methods for details). We defined nIRCat ∆F/F hotspots as regions of interest (ROIs) based on a per-pixel stack projection of maximal ∆F/F in the imaging time series. The ROIs identified were found to vary in size from 1 µm to 15 µm ( Figure  3d , 3e). We found that ∆F/F hotspots do not necessarily correspond to high nIRCat labeling of the brain tissue, suggesting that the hotspot is a consequence of variation in dopamine release and not nanosensor loading in the tissue (Figure 3d , Figure S3 a-c). Using data from single pulse electrical stimulation experiments, the program identified ROIs whose size distribution was observed to exhibit a log-normal distribution with median ROI size of 2 µm (Figure 3e ). Repeat stimulations with the same stimulation amplitude in fields of view of the dorsomedial striatum across biological replicates generated similar size distributions (Figure 3f ). Closer examination of several larger ROIs (> 5µm) suggested these may be comprised of smaller hot-spots in close proximity (Figure 3g , Figure S3 d-e).For further examination of the temporal resolution of nIRCats, we compared the temporal profile of evoked transients measured with nIRCats to transients measured with fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). FSCV is a technique that has been widely used to measure temporal catecholamine dynamics both in vivo and in vitro in the striatum and other brain areas. [30] [31] [32] FSCV and nIRCat experiments were conducted on separate experimental rigs with the same solutions, temperature settings, electrodes, and stimulation parameters. Evoked transients measured with FSCV and nIRCat fluorescence emission showed comparable temporal profiles in the rising phase (latency to peak: FSCV = 0.25 ± 0.0 s vs. nIRCat = 0.40 ± 0.18 s; mean ± s. d., n=4 fields of view from 2 biological replicates, p=0.23). Meanwhile, nIRCat signals exhibited a wider diversity of decay kinetics (: FSCV = 0.51 ± 0.08 s vs. nIRCats = 2.43 ± 0.24 s; mean ± s. d. n=4 fields of view from 2 biological replicates, p=0.0002). A subset of ROIs exhibited decay time constants that overlapped with, or were faster than, those of FSCV signals (Figure 3h, 3i) . We next evaluated the ability of nIRCats to detect dopamine in the presence of dopamine receptor (DR) drugs. In in vitro solution phase experiments (without biological tissue), we found that nIRCat fluorescence intensity was not modulated by exposure to 1 µM concentration of DRD2 antagonists sulpiride, haloperidol, the DRD2 agonist quinpirole, or the DRD1 antagonist SCH-23390 (Figure 4a) .

Conversely, application of sulpiride (1 µM) significantly increased nIRCat ∆F/F (Figure 4d, 4e) . The effects of quinpirole and sulpiride were reproducible in n=3 biological replicates (Figure 4f) . Importantly, the effects of D2 receptor pharmacology on nIRCat fluorescence modulation by dopamine were absent in vitro and only present in brain tissue. In brain tissue, presynaptic dopamine receptors play a critical role in regulating dopamine release, and our results are consistent with powerful inhibition of dopamine efflux by the DRD2 agonist quinpirole and facilitation of dopamine efflux by the DRD2 antagonist sulpiride.

Imaging of optogenetically-evoked dopamine release in acute striatal brain slices

To further confirm striatal nIRCat nanosenor signals were indeed reporting dopamine release, we compared channelrhodopsin (ChR2) stimulation of cortical glutamatergic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals in the dorsal striatum. Acute striatal brain slices were prepared from mice virally transfected to express the light sensitive cation channel ChR2 in either dopaminergic terminals (targeted by viral injection in the midbrain in DAT-cre mice; ChR2-DA) (Figure 5c, Figure S4 ) or glutamatergic terminals of the striatum (targeted by viral injection in the frontal cortices, ChR2-GLU) (Figure 5a ). Upon optical stimulation of ChR2-DA terminals with a 473 nm laser (5 pulses at 25 Hz, 1 mW/mm 2 ) in the dorsal striatum, we observed significant fluorescence modulation of nIRCat signal (Figure 5d ). When optogenetic stimulation instead targeted glutamatergic terminals, fluorescent nIRCat signals did not rise above baseline fluctuation, although we could observe light-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in striatal MSNs (Figure 5b ).Returning to ChR2-DA stimulation, we next varied the number of stimulation pulses (5 ms pulse duration, 25 Hz, 1 mW/mm 2 ) and observed scaling in nIRCat ∆F/F amplitude from 1 pulse to 10 pulses (p=0.005), and trend level differences between 1 pulse and 5 pulses (p=0.0645) and 5 pulses and 10 pulses (p=0.086) (Figure 5e ). When we varied the pulse frequency while holding the number of pulses constant at 5, we observed scaling with significant differences detectable between 1 Hz and 10 Hz (p=0.036). The amplitude difference between 10 Hz and 25 Hz did not reach significance (p=0.179) (Figure 5f ). In single pulse experiments in which we varied pulse width, nIRCat fluorescence responses scaled with pulse duration. This effect was significant when comparing 2 ms to 5 ms (p=0.002) but the difference from 5 ms to 10 ms did not reach significance (p=0.055) (Figure 5g ).Finally we tested the effect of dopaminergic pharmacological agents on optogenetically evoked dopamine release (ChR2-DA). Bath application of quinpirole (1 µM) powerfully suppressed nIRCat fluorescence (p<0.0001), and this effect was reversed after drug washout (Figure 5h ). Nomifensine (10 µM) enhanced nIRCat signal decay time, consistent with the predicted slowing of dopamine clearance from the ECS ( Figure S5 ). 

Conclusion

In order to understand how neuromodulation alters the plasticity and activity of distinct populations of neurons, there is need for new optical tools that can measure the extracellular dynamics of neuromodulator release and reuptake at spatiotemporal resolution commensurate with methods used to record neural activity (e.g. electrophysiology and calcium imaging). Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of using of a non-genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, nIRCat, which enables optical detection of catecholamine release and reuptake with sub-second temporal and with micrometer spatial resolution. We used electrical and optogenetic methods in ex vivo brain slices to demonstrate that nIRCat fluorescent signals can successfully report differences in evoked dopamine release and pharmacologically induced changes in dopamine dynamics in striatal brain tissue.Here, we focused nIRCat imaging experiments within the dorsal striatum, a region that receives dense dopaminergic innervation and negligible norepinephrine innervation. 25 Therefore, while nIRCats are not selective for dopamine over norepinephrine, nIRCats effectively function as a dopamine sensor within the context of the striatum. Given that striatal dopamine regulates fundamental processes including motor function, motivation and learning, nIRCats represent an important addition to the neuroscience investigative toolkit.While other tools are emerging to optically report dopamine fluctuations via cell-surface engineered proteins, 33, 34 nIRCats are likely to fulfill a niche amongst currently available methods for detecting dopamine neurotransmission due to their unique near-infrared fluorescence, the fact that they do not rely on genetic delivery and expression, and the functionality of nIRCats in the presence of pharmacological dopamine receptor ligands. This is in contrast to receptor-based fluorescent sensors which currently cannot report on endogenous dopamine dynamics in the presence of ligands to the engineered receptor. 33, 34 Furthermore, the synthetic nature of nIRCats affords complete elimination of potential GPCR-mediated residual signaling that may be present in protein-based optical probes. nIRCats also offer spatial advantages over FSCV, and our initial experiments suggest that the temporal resolution of the nIRCat signal can be comparable to that of FSCV. nIRCat decay profiles exhibit a wider range than that observed from FSCV data and included a significant number of ROIs that showed seconds-long time constants. It is debatable if these results capture the unique spatial properties of specific striatal ROIs or are related to tool differences alone. nIRCats, unlike FSCV probes, should sample catecholamine concentration at a single point in space, such that each distributed nIRCat construct can act as a probe within the ECS and therefore yield a ""higher resolution"" picture of catecholamine dynamics. Future experiments will investigate how the heterogeneity of nIRCat signals (amplitude and kinetics) relates to structural and functional properties at dopamine terminals and within the ECS. We predict that new optical tools for measuring dopamine dynamics with high spatial resolution will be enable new insights into the regulation of dopamine release and reuptake at the level of individual synapses. [35] [36] [37] In the future, we see potential for expansion of a larger family of SWNT based nearinfrared nanosensors (nIRNS) similar to nIRCats for multiple neurochemical imaging applications. Several lines of evidence illustrate their future potential. First, nIRNS are easily functionalized with a wide range of synthetic molecular recognition moieties, affording fine control of their surface functional elements and their interactions with the local chemical environment. [38] [39] [40] SWNT fluorescence can be finely tuned to monochromatic emission in the near-infrared II (1000-1700 nm) window by controlling the SWNT chirality. 41 This chirality-dependent fluorescence in the near-infrared II window provides further avenues for designing color-specific responses to multiple molecular analytes simultaneously, thereby affording synthesis of ratiometric and multiplexed analyte imaging platforms, as we have shown previously. 42 Second, SWNT-based nanosensors rely on near-infrared fluorescence, which greatly reduces the impact of tissue scattering in the emission window and therefore may enable through-cranium imaging. 21 nIRNS are compatible with multi-photon imaging with 1600 nm excitation 43 and as such could permit nanoscale imaging of intact neuronal structures pending parallel developments in allinfrared microscopy, as has been shown with visible wavelength-emitting fluorophores. 44 Third, nIRNS have robust photostability allowing for use in long-term imaging experiments. 45 Fourth, because nIRNS are not genetically-encoded, they could enable use in species where gene delivery and protein expression is too difficult, time consuming, or undesirable. Finally, nanosecond-scale binding kinetics and the nanoscale dimensions of nIRNS 48 , are likely to enable generation of nanosensors with improved temporal and spatial resolution. In sum, nIRCats are versatile catecholamine probes amenable to multiplexing with existing tools for concurrent investigation of dopaminergic neuromodulation with other core mechanisms of brain function.

Nanosensor synthesis

(GT)6 oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Standard Desalting). HiPCo SWNT were purchased from NanoIntegris (Batch # HR27-104). (GT)6-SWNT colloidal suspension (nIRCat) was prepared by mixing 1 mg of (GT)6 and 1 mg of SWNT in 1 mL of a 100 mM NaCl solution. The solution was bath sonicated (Branson Ultrasonic 1800) for 10 minutes and probe-tip sonicated for 10 minutes at 5 W power (Cole Parmer Ultrasonic Processor, 3 mm tip diameter) in an ice-bath. The sonicated solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The product was subsequently centrifuged at 16,000 g (Eppendorf 5418) for 90 minutes to remove unsuspended SWNT bundles and amorphous carbon, and the supernatant was recovered for characterization and use. Each nanosensor suspension was stored at 4°C until use.

Nanosensor characterization

To characterize nIRCats post-synthesis, the full visible and near-infrared absorption spectrum was taken for each nanosensor batch (UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer, Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus) or UV-VIS (ThermoFisher Scientific Genesys 20) . SWNT concentrations of as-made nanosensor batches were determined using absorbance at 632 nm (UV-VIS) with an extinction coefficient of  = 0.036 (mg/L) -1 cm -1 . Full spectrum absorbance measurements were made with UV-VIS-NIR after dilution to 5 mg/L SWNT concentration in 100 mM NaCl. For fluorescence spectroscopy, each sensor batch was diluted to a working concentration of 5 mg/L in 100 mM NaCl, and aliquots of 198 µL were placed in each well of a 96-well plate (Corning). Fluorescence measurements were obtained with a 20 X objective on an inverted Zeiss microscope (Axio Observer.D1) coupled to a Princeton Instruments spectrograph (SCT 320) and liquid nitrogen cooled Princeton Instruments InGaAs linear array detector (PyLoN-IR). A 721nm laser (OptoEngine LLC) was used as the excitation light source for all characterization experiments.

Neurotransmitter and dopamine receptor drug screening

For neurotransmitter response screens, we collected the near-infrared fluorescence spectrum from 198 µL aliquots of nanosensor (5 mg/L SWNT concentration) before and after addition of 2 µL of 10 mM solutions of each analyte neurotransmitter (for a 100 µM final analyte concentration in each well of a 96-well plate). All neurotransmitter analytes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Neurotransmitter analytes were incubated for 5 minutes before taking post-analyte fluorescence measurements. Responses were calculated for the integrated fluorescence count as ∆F/F0 = (F-F0)/F0, where F0 is total fluorescence before analyte addition and F is total fluorescence after analyte addition or for peak fluorescence change corresponding to the (9,4) SWNT chirality (~1128 nm center wavelength). All measurements were made in triplicate. Reported results are mean and standard deviations of the triplicate measurements. All nIRCat nanosensor batches were tested for catecholamine responses prior to use for tissue catecholamine imaging. Dopamine receptor drugs were purchased from Tocris (quinpirole and sulpiride), abcam (SCH 23390) and Sigma-Aldrich (haloperidol). nIRCat fluorescence modulation to dopamine receptor drugs were measured after addition of 1 µM drug quantities (final concentration in well) in each well. Post-drug fluorescence spectra were taken after 5minute drug incubation. To measure nIRCat response to dopamine in the presence of drugs, dopamine aliquots were added to each drug-incubated well to obtain 100 µM dopamine, and post-dopamine fluorescence spectra were taken after an additional 5-minute incubation period.

The coverslip was then rinsed with DI water and left to dry. The coverslip was then fixed onto an ibidi sticky-Slide VI 0.4 forming 6 microfluidic channels. First, 100 μL of PBS was pipetted through a channel. Next, the channel was filled 50 μL of a 5 mg/L solution of nIRCats and left to incubate at room temperature for 5 min. The channel was rinsed using three 50 μL PBS washes, keeping the channel filled with solution at all times. The surface immobilized nIRCats in PBS were imaged on an epifluorescence microscope with 721 nm excitation and a Ninox VIS-SWIR 640 camera (Raptor). One end of the flow channel was connected to a syringe pump (Harvard Appartus) using Luer lock fittings. Prior to the start of image acquisition, the opposite flow reservoir was filled with PBS and the pump was set to refill mode at a volumetric flow rate of 40 μL min -1 . Once the liquid in the reservoir was depleted, 40 μL of 10 μM dopamine in PBS was added. The process was repeated using alternating additions of 80 μL of PBS washes and 40 μL of dopamine solution.

Acute slice preparation and nanosensor labeling

Mice were C57 Bl/6 strain, 60 days old, and both male and female mice were used. Mice were group housed after weaning at P21 and kept with nesting material on a 12:12 light cycle. All animal procedures were approved by the UC Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC). Acute brain slices were prepared using established protocols. 28 Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine cocktail and transcardial perfusion was performed using ice-cold cutting buffer (119 mM NaCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1mM NaH2PO4, 3.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Glucose, 0 mM CaCl2), after which the brain was rapidly extracted. The cerebellum and other connective tissues were trimmed using a razor blade and the brain was mounted onto the cutting stage of a vibratome (Leica VT 1200S). Coronal slices (300 µm in thickness) including the dorsal striatum were prepared. Slices were incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes in oxygen saturated ACSF (119 mM NaCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1mM NaH2PO4, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Glucose, 2 mM CaCl2) before use. Slices were then transferred to room temperature for 30 minutes before starting imaging experiments and were maintained at room temperature for the remainder of experimentation.For nanosensor labeling, slices were transferred into a small volume brain slice incubation chamber (Scientific Systems Design, Inc., AutoMate Scientific) and kept under oxygen saturated ACSF (total 5 mL volume). 100 µL of 100 mg/L nIRCat nanosensor was added to the 5mL volume and the slice was incubated in this solution for 15 minutes.

"Abstract

To determine the relative impact of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on outcomes important to patients with COVID 19.This is the protocol of a living systematic review.We will follow a common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews, already published and submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID allocation). We will include randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine -as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs -versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low-or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

","INTRODUCTION

is an infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus [1] . It was first identified in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019 [2] ; three months later, almost half a million cases of contagion had been identified across 197 countries [3] . On March 11, 2020 , WHO characterised the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic [1] .While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some might progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and death [4] , [5] , [6] . The case fatality rate reported across countries, settings and age groups is highly variable, but it would range from about 0.5% to 10% [7] . In hospitalized patients it has been reported to be higher than 10% in some centres [8] .Many candidate drugs have been proposed as potentially effective, but the antimalarial agents chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have attracted more attention than any other medication [9] . Some in vitro studies have suggested they would exert antiviral properties by inhibiting ph-dependant steps of viral replication [10] , not only against SARS-COV-2, but also Chikungunya, Dengue, Zika, Influenza A H1N1 and H3N2, Coronavirus HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, among others [11] , [12] . Other researchers have found an anti-inflammatory and immune-stimulating effect mediated by TNF-and IL-6 that would block the cascade of events leading to acute respiratory distress syndro me [10] .Notwithstanding, despite its in vitro activity against several agents, to this date there is no acute viral infection that has been successfully treated by chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Moreover, in Chikungunya virus infection, chloroquine showed the paradoxical effect of leading to more chronic complications in the patients who received it, an outcome that would be explained by a delay in immune adaptive response [13] . The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unknown, therefore the clinical effects of administration of antimalarials in COVID-19 patients is largely unpredictable [ 14 ] .Theory aside, the use of antimalarials attracted attention after a news briefing by the Chinese government in February 2020 revealed that, according to several Chinese studies, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine seemed 'to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19' [15] . No empirical data supporting these findings have been published so far. A second boost of attention on antimalarials came after the release of a non-randomised study -with considerable methodological limitations -claiming that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin achieved a high level of SARS-CoV-2 clearance in respiratory secretions [16] . 1 Most researchers have asked for caution while we wait for the information from dozens of randomised trials already ongoing or planned, but the US Food and Drug Administration has authorized clinicians to prescribe it for patients admitted to hospital, despite warnings from scientific advisers [17] .Using innovative and agile processes, taking advantage of technological tools, and resorting to the collective effort of several research groups, this living systematic review aims to provide a timely, 1 3 .

Protocol and registration

This manuscript complies with the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses' (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses [18] .A protocol stating the shared objectives and methodology of multiple evidence syntheses (systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews) to be conducted in parallel for different questions relevant to COVID-19 was registered in PROSPERO (submitted, awaiting PROSPERO ID allocation) and published [19] . The protocol was adapted to the specificities of the question assessed in this review.

Electronic searches

Our literature search was devised by the team maintaining the L·OVE platform ( https://app.iloveevidence.com ) , using the following approach:1. Identification of terms relevant to the population and intervention components of the search strategy, using Word2vec technology [20] to the corpus of documents available in Epistemonikos Database. 2. Discussion of terms with content and methods experts to identify relevant, irrelevant and missing terms. 3. Creation of a sensitive boolean strategy encompassing all of the relevant terms 4. Iterative analysis of articles missed by the boolean strategy, and refinement of the strategy accordingly.Our main search source was Epistemonikos database ( https://www.epistemonikos.org ), a comprehensive database of systematic reviews and other types of evidence [21] . We supplemented it with articles from multiple sources relevant to COVID-19 (without any study design, publication status or language restriction) [22] . In sum, Epistemonikos Database acts as a central repository. Only articles fulfilling Epistemonikos criteria are visible by users. The remaining articles are only accessible for members of COVID-19 L·OVE Working Group.4 .

Other sources

In order to identify articles that might have been missed in the electronic searches, we will do the following:1. Screen the reference lists of other systematic reviews, and evaluate in full text all the articles they include. 2. Scan the reference lists of selected guidelines, narrative reviews and other documents. 3. Conduct cross-citation search in Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic, using each included study as the index reference. 4. Review websites from pharmaceutical companies producing drugs claimed as effective for COVID-19 drugs, websites or databases of major regulatory agencies, and other websites specialised in COVID-19. 5. Email the contact authors of all of the included studies to ask for additional publications or data on their studies, and for other studies in the topic. 6. Review the reference list of each included study.

Types of studies

We will preferently include randomised trials. However, information from non-randomised studies will be used if there is no direct evidence from randomised trials or the certainty of evidence for the critical outcomes resulting from the randomised trials is graded as low-or very low, and the certainty provided by the non-randomised evidence grades higher than the one provided by the randomised evidence [23] .We will exclude studies evaluating the effects on animal models or in vitro conditions.

Types of participants

We will include trials assessing participants with COVID-19, as defined by the authors of the trials. If substantial clinical heterogeneity on how the condition was defined is found, we will explore it using a sensitivity analysis.In case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the evidence from randomised trials provides low-or very low-certainty evidence for critical outcomes, we will include information from randomised trials evaluating antimalarials in other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infections [23] .

Type of interventions

The interventions of interest are the antimalarials chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. We will not restrict our criteria to any dosage, duration, timing or route of administration.The comparison of interest will be placebo (intervention plus optimal treatment versus placebo plus optimal treatment) or no treatment (antimalarials plus optimal treatment versus optimal treatment). Trials assessing antimalarials plus other drugs will be eligible if the cointerventions are identical in both intervention and comparison groups.Trials evaluating antimalarials in combination with other active drugs versus placebo or no treatment will be also included.

Type of outcomes

We will not use the outcomes as an inclusion criteria during the selection process. Any article meeting all the criteria except for the outcome criterion will be preliminarily included and evaluated in full text. We used the core outcome set COS-COVID [24] , the existing guidelines and reviews and the judgement of the authors of this review as an input to select the primary and secondary outcomes, as well as to decide upon inclusion. The review team will revise this list of outcomes, in order to incorporate ongoing efforts to define Core Outcomes Sets [25] .6 .

Selection of studies

The results of the literature search in Epistemonikos database will be automatically incorporated into the L·OVE platform (automated retrieval), where they will be de-duplicated by an algorithm comparing unique identifiers (database ID, DOI, trial registry ID), and citation details (i.e. author names, journal, year of publication, volume, number, pages, article title and article abstract).The additional searches will be uploaded to the screening software Collaboratron™ [ 27 ] .In both L·OVE platform and Collaboratron™, two researchers will independently screen the titles and abstracts yielded by the search against the inclusion criteria. We will obtain the full reports for all titles that appear to meet the inclusion criteria or require further analysis to decide on their inclusion.We will record the reasons for excluding trials in any stage of the search and outline the study selection process in a PRISMA flow diagram adapted for the purpose of this project .

Extraction and management of data

Using standardised forms, two reviewers will extract data independently from each included study. We will collect the following information: study design, setting, participant characteristics (including disease severity and age) and study eligibility criteria; details about the administered intervention and comparison, including dose and therapeutic scheme, duration, timing (i.e. time after diagnosis) and route of administration; the outcomes assessed and the time they were measured; the source of funding of the study and the conflicts of interest disclosed by the investigators; the risk of bias assessment for each individual study. 7 .

Risk of bias assessment

The risk of bias for each randomised trial will be assessed using a 'risk of bias' tool (RoB 2.0: a revised tool to assess risk of bias in randomised trials) [28] . We will consider the effect of assignment to the intervention for this review. Two reviewers will independently assess five domains of bias for each outcome result of all reported outcomes and time points. These five domains are: bias due to (1) the randomisation process, (2) deviations from intended interventions (effects of assignment to interventions at baseline), (3) missing outcome data, (4) measurement of the outcome, and (5) selection of reported results. Answers to signalling questions and supporting information collectively will lead to a domain-level judgement in the form of 'Low risk of bias', 'Some concerns', or 'High risk of bias'. These domain-level judgements will inform an overall 'risk of bias' judgement for each result. Discrepancies between review authors will be resolved by discussion to reach consensus. If necessary, a third review author will be consulted to achieve a decision.We will assess their risks of bias with the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I), a tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions [29] . We will assess the following domains: bias due to confounding, bias in selection of participants into the study, bias in classification of interventions, bias due to deviations from intended interventions (effect of assignment to intervention), bias due to missing data, bias in measurement of outcomes and bias in the selection of the reported result. We will judge each domain as low risk, moderate risk, serious risk, critical risk, or no information, and evaluate individual bias items as described in ROBINS-I guidance. We will not consider time-varying confounding, as these confounders are not relevant in this setting [29] . We will consider the following factors as baseline potential confounders:• Age • Comorbidity (e.g. cardiovascular disease, renal disease, eye disease, liver disease) • Co-interventions • Severity, as defined by the authors (i.e respiratory failure vs respiratory distress syndrome vs ICU requirement).

Measures of treatment effect

For dichotomous outcomes, we will express the estimate of treatment effect of an intervention as risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) along with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, we will use mean difference and standard deviation (SD) to summarise the data using a 95% CI. Whenever continuous outcomes are measured using different scales, the treatment effect will be expressed as a standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI. When possible, we will multiply the SMD by a standard deviation that is representative from the pooled studies, for example, the SD from a well-known scale used by several of the studies included in the analysis on which the result is based. In cases where the minimally important difference (MID) is known, we will also present continuous 8 .

Strategy for data synthesis

If we include more than one trial we will conduct meta-analysis for studies clinically homogeneous using RevMan 5 [31] , using the inverse variance method with random effects model. For any outcomes where data was insufficient to calculate an effect estimate, a narrative synthesis will be presented.

Subgroup and sensitivity analysis

We will perform subgroup analysis according to the definition of severe COVID-19 infection (i.e respiratory failure vs respiratory distress syndrome vs ICU requirement). In case we identify significant differences between subgroups (test for interaction <0.05) we will report the results of individual subgroups separately.We will perform sensitivity analysis excluding high risk of bias studies, and if non-randomised studies are used, excluding studies that did not report adjusted estimates. In cases where the primary analysis effect estimates and the sensitivity analysis effect estimates significantly differ we will either present the low risk of bias -adjusted sensitivity analysis estimates -or present the primary analysis estimates but downgrading the certainty of the evidence because of risk of bias.

Assessment of certainty of evidence

"Abstract

A total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins tested in Tongji hospital were retrospectively investigated. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and outcomes data were compared between mild-moderate group and died group. Further, a paired case-control study was conducted where each deceased case was matched to three mild-moderate patients of similar age.Among 116 subjects included, 101 mild-moderate patients survived and 15 cases died.SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, while serum IgG levels increased over 8 weeks. Serum IgM levels were higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.024), but not IgG.Serum IgM levels were negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count and albumin levels (r = -0.269, P = 0.003; r = -0.188, P = 0.043; and r = -0.198, P = 0.033, resp.). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for IgM antibody was 0.681 (95% CI: 0.517-0.845, P = 0.024). In case-control study paired by age, serum IgM was higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.019), positively correlated with leucocyte count (r = 0.260, P = 0.045), while negatively correlated with clinical outcome and albumin levels (r = -0.337, P = 0.008; r = -0.265, P = 0.041).AUC for IgM levels was 0.704 (95% CI: 0.534-0.873, P = 0.019).These results indicate that dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies was similar with that of SARS-CoV, while elevated serum IgM levels indicate poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

","Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide since its discovery in December 2019 1, 2 . As of March 14, 2020, over five thousand death from 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been reported in 43 countries 3 .Effective strategies to treat this disease are urgently needed, but no drugs have been proven to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia 4 . Antibodies are key components in the immune responses to viral infections 5, 6 . Raised SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) have been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients 7 . However, less information is available about their dynamics and role in COVID-19 pneumonia.Therefore, 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and with SARS-CoV-2 specific serum IgM and IgG detected were retrospectively selected between February 23, 2020, and March 11, 2020. The dynamics and role of serum IgM and IgG were investigated in this study.

Study design and participants

A total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and with serum IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 examined between February 23, 2020, and March 11, 2020 in Tongji Hospital were retrospectively investigated. In brief, the patients in mild-moderate group described here were all probable hospitalized subjects in four wards of Tongji hospital with (1) serum IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 examined, (2) chest radiographic evidence of pneumonia, (3) positive throat swab nucleic acid test by real-time RT-PCR methods or were excluded from this study. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (IRB ID：TJ-IRB20200343).

Data collection

Information collection was accomplished through our hospital's electronic medical record system. Clinical, laboratory, radiological parameters and clinical outcomes were obtained with standardised forms for all subjects involved. Two researchers independently reviewed the data.

Antibody measurement

Serum IgM and IgG antibodies were detected by the chemiluminescence kit (iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, iFlash-SARS-CoV-2 IgG) and iFlash 3000 CLIA System supplied by Yhlo Biotech Co. LTD (Shenzhen, China), of which the chemiluminescence kit had completed the EU CE certification. Threshold of 10 AU/ml was used for both IgM and IgG as manufacturer recommended.

Statistical analysis

The statistical software SPSS 23.0 was used in this study. Categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous variables were described using mean with interquartile range (IQR). When the data were normal, continuous variables were analysed by t tests, otherwise using the Mann-Whitney test. 

Laboratory parameters in mild-moderate and deceased patients

The blood counts of patients on admission showed significantly decrease in lymphocytes, especially in died group than in mild-moderate patients ( Table 2) . Figure 1A , B). We subsequently explored the correlations between IgM levels and clinical outcome, serum IgG levels, blood counts, or other involved parameters.Interestingly, serum IgM levels were positively correlated with IgG levels (r = 0.251, P = 0.006), while negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count and All rights reserved.

Case-control study paired by age

As reported, antibodies to coronaviruses are higher in older compared with younger adults 9 . To minimize confounding effects from age, a paired case-control study was further done. Each deceased case was matched with three mild-moderate patients of similar age (age difference within four years). Leucocyte count and neutrophil count of patients on admission were significantly higher in died group than mild-moderate patients ( author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Host immune responses play a key role in virus elimination.Histological examination of lungs from patients who died of COVID-19 revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular exudates, accompanied by interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates 13 . Meanwhile, peripheral T cells counts were substantially reduced, while their status was hyperactivated 13, 14 .

It is a single-centre retrospective study with limited cases. Majority of patients admitted in our hospital were critically ill, so population bias exists. In addition, results of viral load and antibody re-testing were not available.In summary, our results demonstrate that dynamics of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was similar with that of SARS-CoV. Differently, elevated serumIgM levels indicate poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

"Abstract

Object Meteorological parameters are the important factors influencing the infectious diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). in Wuhan, China. Then, the generalized additive model was applied to explore the impact of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on daily mortality of COVID-19.There were in total 2299 COVID-19 mortality counts in Wuhan. A positive association with COVID-19 mortality was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = −0.32). In addition, each 1 unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 mortality at lag 3.However, both per 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 mortality at lag 3 and lag 5, respectively.In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality.

","Introduction

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, which caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2] . The COVID-19 had been affirmed to have human-to-human transmissibility [3] and has now spread worldwide, which raised high attention not only within China but internationally. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that there are 118, 326 confirmed cases and 4292 deaths in globally until March 11, 2020 [4] , and evaluated as global pandemic on the same day [5] .In retrospect studies, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong in 2003 gradually faded with the warming weather coming, and was basically ended until July [6] . It has been documented that the temperature and its variations might have affected the SARS outbreak [7] . A study in Korea found that the risk of influenza incidence was significantly increased with low daily temperature and low/high relative humidity, a positive significant association was observed for diurnal temperature range (DTR) [8] . Moreover, temperature [9] and DTR [10] have been linked to the death from respiratory diseases. A study demonstrated that absolute humidity had significant correlations with influenza viral survival and transmission rates [11] . Couple of studies reported that the COVID-19 was related to the meteorological factors, which decreased with the temperature increasing [12, 13] , but their effects on the mortality had not been reported. Therefore, we assume that the weather conditions might also contributed to the mortality of COVID-19.As the capital of Hubei Province and one of the largest city in central China, Wuhan is located in the middle of the Yangtze River Delta, which has a typical subtropical, humid, monsoon climate with cold winters and warm summers [14] . The average annual temperature and rainfall are 15.8 °C-17.5 °C and 1050 mm-2000 mm, respectively [15] . Besides, Wuhan owns an area of 8494 km 2 and a population over 11 million (as of 2018) [16] . So far, this COVID-19 has caused 5393 deaths globally, .

Although the deaths may be affected by many factors, the present is to explore the effect from meteorological angel with generalized additive model (GAM).

Data collection

Data from 20 January to 29 

Calculation of absolute humidity

Absolute humidity was calculated according to the previous study and was measured by vapor pressure (VP) [17] . The density of water vapor, or absolute humidity [ρ v (g/m 3 )], is the mass of moisture per total volume of air. It is associated to VP via the ideal gas law for the moist portion of the air:Where e is vapor pressure (VP), R v is the gas constant for water vapor [461.53 J/(kg K)], and T is the daily ambient temperature (K). VP is a commonly used indicator of absolute humidity and is calculated from ambient temperature and relative humidity using the Clausius-Clapeyron relation [18] . Briefly, we first calculated the saturation vapor pressure [e s (T) (mb)] from daily ambient temperature using the following equation:Where e s (T 0 ) denotes saturation vapor pressure at a reference temperature T 0 (273.15 K) which equals to 6.11 mb. L denotes the latent heat of evaporation for water (2257 kJ/kg). R v is the gas constant for water vapor [461.53 J/(kg K)]. T denotes daily ambient temperature (K). Then, VP (Pa) was calculated by combining the e s (T) calculated using Eq. (2) with relative humidity (RH):

Statistical methods

A descriptive analysis was performed. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) to analyze the associations between meteorological factors (temperature, DTR, relative humidity and absolute humidity) and the daily mortality of COVID-19. The core analysis was a GAM with a quasi-Poisson link function based on the previous studies [19, 20] . We first built the basic models for mortality .

We incorporated smoothed spline functions of time, which accommodate nonlinear and nonmonotonic patterns between mortality and time, thus offering a flexible modeling tool. Then, we introduced the weather variables and analyzed their effects on mortality. Akaike's information criterion was used as a measure of how well the model fitted the data. Consistent with several recent time-series studies [21, 22] , the penalized smoothing spline function was applied to control the effects of confounding factors, such as time trends, day-of-week and air pollution. The core GAM equation is:Where t is the day of the observation; E(Y t ) is the expected number of daily mortality for COVID-19 on day t; α is the intercept;β is the regression coefficient; X t is the daily level of weather variables on day t; s() denotes the smoother based on the penalized smoothing spline. Based on quasi Akaike information criterion (QAIC), the 2 degrees of freedom (df) was used for time trends and 3 df for air pollutants, temperature and relative humidity; DOW is a categorical variable indicating the date of the week.After establishing the core model, we also considered the lag effects of weather conditions on death of COVID-19, and examined the potentially lagged effects, i.e., single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 5) and multiple-day average lag (from lag 01 to lag 05) [23] . The exposure and response correlation curves between weather variables and COVID-19 mortality were plotted using a spline function in the GAM. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by changing the df of the penalized smoothing spline function from 2 to 9 for calendar time and from 3 to 8 for temperature and humidity.All of the statistical analyses were two-sided, and at a 5% level of significance. All analyses were conducted using R software (version 3.5.3) with the GAM fitted by the ""mgcv"" package (version 1.8-27). The effect estimates were expressed as the percentage changes and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in daily mortality of COVID-19 associated with per 1 unit increase in weather variables. 

Correlation between COVID-19 mortality and meteorological factors and air pollutants

The correlation results between mortality counts of COVID-19, meteorological measures and air pollutant concentrations were presented in Table 2 . The mortality counts of COVID-19 was negatively associated with relative humidity (r = −0.32), PM 2.5 (r = −0.53) and PM 10 (r = −0.45). A positive .

Generally, the curves tended to be not associated with COVID-19 mortality for DTR but were strongly positive for temperature. In addition, the curves associated with relative humidity and absolute humidity presented similar linear trends, which indicated that the higher level of humidity might cause decrease in the COVID-19 mortality. 

Discussion

The study was conducted in Wuhan during 20 January, 2020 to 29 February, 2020, in order to investigate the association between weather variables and daily death number of COVID-19.Significant positive effect of DTR on the daily mortality counts of COVID-19 was first identified through our study. It is also found that a significant negative association with COVID-19 mortality is observed for temperature and absolute humidity. The results indicate that the effects of DTR should also be paid attention on the mortality of COVID-19.Our study demonstrated a negative association between COVID-19 case fatality and temperature, while a positive association for DTR. The results are consistent with the following investigations.Respiratory diseases mortality increased with decreasing temperature [24], and was strongly associated with low temperature [25-27]. While another study found that both cold and heat effects may have adverse impact on respiratory mortality [28] . Otherwise, the study conducted in 30 East Asian cities showed that increased DTR was associated with increased risk of mortality for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [29] . In the cold season, the cumulative relative risk of non-accidental, respiratory and cardiovascular death increased at high DTR values in Tabriz [30] . A time-series study done in Shanghai on the effect of DTR and daily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality showing that each 1°C elevation in the 4-day moving average for DTR accounted for 1.25% of increased risk of COPD mortality [31] . A review for cold exposure and immune function reported that lower temperature may repress the immune function [32] , particularly, our previous finding suggested that the phagocytic function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages declined under cold stress in vitro experiment [33] . Breathing cold air can lead to bronchial constriction, which may promote susceptibility to pulmonary infection [34] . Additionally, since SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to heat, and high temperature makes it difficult to survive, not to mention the beneficial factors for virus transmission like indoor crowding and poor ventilation in cold days [35] . Also, cold temperature has been discovered to be associated with the reduction of lung function and increases in exacerbations for people with COPD [36] . In addition, DTR represents a stable measure of temperature, which is an indicator of temperature variability to evaluate effects on human health, including mortality and .

Besides, abrupt temperature changes may add the burden of cardiac and respiratory system causing cardiopulmonary events and high DTR levels may be a source of environmental stress [30] . Our findings highlight a need to strengthen the awareness of the effects of temperature and DTR on COVID-19 mortality.Researchers confirmed that respiratory infection was enhanced during unusually cold and low humidity conditions [38] , indicating low humidity may be also an important risk factor for respiratory diseases. Worse, a study with data of more than 25 years found that humidity was an important determinant of mortality and low-humidity levels may cause a large increase in mortality rates, potentially by influenza-related mechanisms [39] , similar to a study carried out in the United States [40] . Consistent to these finding, our results also indicated that the risk of dying from COVID-19 decreased only with absolute humidity increasing. Breathing dry air could cause epithelial damage and/or reduction of mucociliary clearance, and then lead to render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infection; The formation of droplet nuclei is essential to transmission, but exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity so that it is hard to contribute to influenza virus spread [41] . Moreover, the transmission of pandemic influenza virus is the most efficient under cold, dry conditions [42] , and influenza virus survival rate increased markedly in accordance with decreasing of absolute humidity [43] , which may be similar to coronavirus. Therefore, the increase of COVID-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter.However, many limitations should not be ignored. Firstly, there are some other factors may affect the COVID-19 mortality, such as population migration, government intervention and so on. Secondly, ecologic time-series study design was adopted in the study, which might exist ecologic fallacy.Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain the meteorological and air pollution data at the individual level.Nevertheless, this study showed that DTR might be associated with the death risk of COVID-19 in Wuhan, which deserves further investigation.

Conclusion

This is the first study to investigate the effects of temperature, DTR and humidity on daily mortality of COVID-19 in Chinese population by utilizing publicly accessible data on COVID-19 statistics and weather variables. Our finding shows that daily mortality of COVID-19 is positively association with DTR but negatively with relative humidity. In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality. GAM: generalized additive model; CI: confidence interval; RR: relative risk.

"Abstract

Background. The clinical presentation of Novel Coronavirus (2019 infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP.We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability.were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone.

","Introduction

Chinese people are facing unprecedented panic induced by the outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) in Wuhan, China since December 2019 [1] . Currently, during Spring Festival travel rush, millions of people leave Wuhan city, and the 2019-nCov would spread quickly especially along with people coming out from Wuhan. By 10 Feb 2020, a total of 3,7626 people have been confirmed NCIP in China [2] .The NCIP is considered a relative of the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. They are characterized by pneumonia symptoms, such as fever, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, respiratory symptoms and possibly transmitted from animal to human [3] [4] [5] . The public health authorities proposed NCIP definitions that combined clinical features (e.g., fever, cough, and anhelation) with epidemiological factors (e.g., travel to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan or direct contact with another patient with NCIP) to improve diagnostic accuracy [6, 7] . Unfortunately, these epidemiological features are not specific and have poor positive predictive value during the outbreak.The NCIP appears to cause symptoms similar to other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) based on clinical data from 41 NCIP patients [3] , and can spread from humans to humans [3, 8] . Distinguishing NCIP from other etiologies of CAP is one of the major challenges of the NCIP outbreak. Despite recommendations that examining hematological and biochemical parameters as part of the diagnostic workup for NCIP [3, 9] , it is urgent to evaluate the ability of these features to accurately discriminate cases of NCIP from cases of CAP. Thus, we conducted the current study aiming to evaluate the ability of routine laboratory tests for distinguishing NCIP from All rights reserved.

Patients and Data collection

To determine the ability of routine laboratory tests, measured at hospital admission, to differentiate NCIP from CAP due to other causes, we compared the hematological and biochemical data of NCIP patients and CAP patients. 

Hematological and serum biochemical examination

Routine hematological and serum biochemical examination was ordered at the discretion of the physicians and were measured using standard methods in our hospital. Fasting whole blood from every patient was collected in an EDTA anticoagulant-treated tube and analyzed within 30 minutes of collection.Routine peripheral blood cells, including hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and monocytes, were analyzed.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS version 22.0 software. Statistical analysis for the results was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for only two groups or using one-way analysis of variance when there were more than two groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability [10] . Higher AUC were considered to show better discriminatory ability as follows: excellent, AUC of ≥0.90; good, 0.80 ≤ AUC<0.90; fair, 0.70 ≤ AUC< 0.80. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

The mean values of laboratory indexes at the time of hospital admission in NCIP patients and CAP patients were demonstrated in table 1 and figure 1.Both NCIP patients and CAP patients had lower mean lymphocyte counts and platelet counts than healthy control. NCIP patients had significantly lower mean values for WBC, neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet counts, and ALP than did patients with CAP. NCIP patients had significantly higher mean values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, ALB, ALT, and AST than did CAP patients.

Discussion

This study indicates that several hematological and biochemical abnormalities occur more frequently in CAP patients than in NCIP patients.The statistically significant difference in mean values was noted for most laboratory features tested except the GLB, GGT and TBA.

December 2019 by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission [11, 12] . Possibly, the Spring Festival travel rush that millions of people were on the way home and 2019-nCov would spread fast especially along with people coming out from Wuhan. Because the confirmation diagnosis of NCIP now mainly relies on PCR assays for the detection of 2019-nCov [13] , initial medical examination of potential NCIP depends primarily on clinical, radiographic, and epidemiological features [9] . Physicians and public health workers keep struggling with the difficult task of evaluating patients for NCIP presenting with unknown febrile respiratory illnesses. As a result, public health authorities went on revising NCIP definitions to improve the accuracy of diagnosis.Our findings demonstrated that nine laboratory features independently predictive of discernibility between NCIP and CAP. The identification of the RDW, HGB and RBC count as the best discriminatory ability, with an AUC of 0.89, 0.81 and 0.78, respectively. The discriminatory ability likely results from elevated RBC and HCB while low RDW seen in NCIP. Our study also highlighted laboratory parameters that are common in both NCIP and CAP and therefore not useful in differentiating the 2 diseases. Lymphocytopenia is characteristic and of similar magnitude for both NCIP and CAP. However, lymphocytopenia in NCIP was also accompanied by depletion of EO and normal BASO, whereas it was accompanied by reduced RBC, elevated neutrophil count and monocyte count in CAP.Because the CAP cohort did not have laboratory indexes over time, trends in laboratory values were unable to perform after hospital admission.Therefore, more significant differences in the laboratory indexes might occur All rights reserved.

"Abstract

Along with tRNAs, enzymes that modify anticodon bases are a key aspect of translation across the 12 tree of life. tRNA modifications extend wobble pairing, allowing specific (""target"") tRNAs to 13 recognize multiple codons and cover for other (""non-target"") tRNAs, often improving translation 14 efficiency and accuracy. However, the detailed evolutionary history and impact of tRNA modifying 15 enzymes has not been analyzed. Using ancestral reconstruction of five tRNA modifications across 16 1093 bacteria, we show that most modifications were ancestral to eubacteria, but were repeatedly 17 lost in many lineages. Most modification losses coincided with evolutionary shifts in non-target 18 tRNAs, often driven by increased bias in genomic GC and associated codon use, or by genome 19 reduction. In turn, the loss of tRNA modifications stabilized otherwise highly dynamic tRNA gene 20 repertoires. Our work thus traces the complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications, providing 21 the first clear evidence for their role in the evolution of bacterial translation. 22 23

","INTRODUCTION 1

Compared to the total complement of 61 sense codons, most bacterial genomes contain only 25 -46 2 unique tRNA species (Grosjean, de Crécy-Lagard, & Marck, 2010) . This apparent shortfall in 3 decoding ability is mitigated by G::U wobble base pairing that allows a single tRNA to decode non-4 complementary codons (Crick, 1966) . Additionally, specific modifications to the first anticodon To address these gaps, we traced the evolutionary history of the five known bacterial tRNA 23 modifications at the first wobble base of the anticodon: (c)mnm5(s2)U (5-24 carboxymethylaminomethyl 2-thiouridine and its variants), cmo5U (uridine-5-oxyacetic acid), k2C 25(2-lysyl-cytidine), Q (Queuosine) and I (Inosine) (Björk & Hagervall, 2014) . We first determined 26 the occurrence of each modification pathway in 1093 sequenced bacteria that represent the diversity 27 of eubacteria, and then used ancestral reconstruction to infer the major evolutionary gain or loss 28 events in the bacterial phylogeny. To determine the causes and impacts of change in tRNA 29 modification, we analyzed two other key components of translation: tRNA gene pools and codon 30 bias, thought to coevolve under translational selection (Ikemura, 1985; Kanaya, Yamada, Kudo, & 31 Ikemura, 1999) . Finally, since both of these factors are in turn correlated with genomic GC content 32 ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/251322 doi: bioRxiv preprint repertoire; either in conjunction with large shifts in genomic GC and associated changes in codon 23 use, or in a GC-independent manner. We suggest that the expanded tRNA set weakened selection 24for MEs, allowing their repeated loss via drift. Conversely, in rare cases, a shrinking of tRNA 25 diversity may have favored the evolution of a novel modification; alternatively, the chance 26 evolution of a new modification may have relaxed selection on the tRNA pool. Our work represents 27 the first systematic analysis of the joint evolutionary history of tRNA modifications, genome GC 28 content and tRNA genes, and elucidates the role of tRNA modifications in the evolution of the 29 bacterial translation machinery. 30

This relative evolutionary instability of QueG 24 corroborates a recent report suggesting that Tgt alone may be enough to generate the Q 25 modification (Zallot, Yuan, & de Crécy-Lagard, 2017). 26To determine the key evolutionary changes in major tRNA modification pathways across bacteria, 27we performed ancestral reconstruction with stochastic character mapping for each ME ( Fig. 1A ; 28 Table S1 ). We used a posterior probability value of ≥ 0.7 to assign the ME state at each internal 29 node in the bacterial phylogeny. Four of the five modification systems -MnmE-MnmG, Tgt-QueA-30QueG, TadA and TilS -were predicted to already occur at the root of the phylogenetic tree, i.e. 31were present in the eubacterial ancestor (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, CmoA-CmoB were gained/evolved 32 much later: once at the root of γ-proteobacteria, once in ε-proteobacteria, and once in some species 33 of δ-proteobacteria (Fig. 1B) . Thus, except for the cmo5U modification, most bacterial tRNA 34 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

These ancient modifications were then independently lost multiple times, 1 with a total of 12 major losses (on branches with at least 5 descendant bacterial species in our 2 phylogeny; Fig. 1B ) and 19 minor loss events (in lineages with fewer than five descendants; Fig.  3 S1). The only exception to this pattern of repeated ME gains/losses is the k2C modification (TilS), 4 which appears to be evolutionarily stable across bacteria. Overall, our analysis demonstrates a 5 highly dynamic evolutionary history of tRNA modifications that is dominated by repeated 6 secondary losses and only a few gains (a total of 44 loss events and 13 gains across the phylogeny; 7Fig. S1). 8 9 tRNA modification loss is associated with more non-target tRNAs 10The early evolution of nearly all tRNA modifications suggests that the eubacterial ancestor should 11 have been able to decode most sense codons using only a subset of all possible tRNAs. Indeed, 12 ancestral reconstruction of tRNA genes suggests that the eubacterial ancestor did have all target 13 tRNAs (excepttRNA Leu UUU ), but did not possess non-target tRNAs for the Q, k2C and I modifications 14 ( Fig. 1C ; note that 1C; note that the state of tRNA Arg UCG is ambiguous). Interestingly, for the 15 (c)mnm5(s2)U modification, both target and non-target tRNA were present in the eubacterial 16 ancestor. Thus, a subsequent loss of any of these modifications should be strongly associated with 17 the gain (or retention, in case of (c)mnm5(s2)U) of the respective non-target tRNA. Both 18 predictions were supported when we observed that the proportion of species that have non-target 19 tRNA is significantly different between bacteria with vs. without a specific modification (p < 0.05, 20 2-sample proportions test; Fig. S2 ). Overall, these patterns suggest that the loss of tRNA 21 modifications was associated with the retention or secondary gain of non-target tRNAs, and the 22 gain of MEs was associated with the loss of non-target tRNAs. 23To account for phylogenetic relationships between analysed bacteria, we compared the tRNA gene 24 content of sister clades with contrasting modification status; i.e. following a major modification 25 gain or loss event (see Methods; Fig. 2 ). For instance, since the (c)mnm5(s2)U modification was 26 lost at the root of Actinobacteria (MnmE/MnmG enzymes, Fig. 1B) , we compared the tRNA gene 27 content of species within the Actinobacteria clade with that of species in the sister group: the 28 Cyanobacteria-Deinococcus-Thermus (CDT) clade. Similarly, we compared the target and non-29 target tRNA gene copy numbers for descendent sister clades for 14 of the 15 major modification 30 gain and loss events highlighted in Fig. 1B (we did not analyze Thermotogae, because its sister 31 clade would consist of all other bacteria). Of these, 4 cases involving the Q modification are not 32 informative with regard to non-target tRNAs because these are absent in all bacteria ( Fig. 2F-2I) . 33 .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/251322 doi: bioRxiv preprint However, we describe these comparisons below since they are useful for understanding the 1 evolution of target tRNAs. 2In most of the informative sister clade comparisons (8 out of 10 cases), species were more likely to 3 have non-target tRNAs if the modification was absent (compare bottom left vs. bottom right bar 4 plots within each panel of Fig. 2 ), supporting our hypothesis that modification loss (gain) is 5 associated with the presence (absence) of non-target tRNAs. For instance, in three out of the five 6 comparisons made for the (c)mnm5(s2)U and cmo5U modifications, at least 5 of the 6 non-target 7 tRNAs were present in a significantly higher proportion of species without the modification (Fig.  8 2A, 2C and 2D; p < 0.05, 2-sample proportions test). The two exceptions to this pattern occur in 9 clades with relatively low sample sizes ( Fig. 2B and 2E) , and may potentially reflect low statistical 10 power. Alternatively, these may be biologically interesting exceptions that require further 11 examination. Additionally, in all five comparisons made for the I modification, at least one non-12 target tRNA (in most cases both) was present in significantly more species without the 13 modification, compared to species with the modification (Fig. 2J -2N ; p < 0.05, 2-sample 14proportions test) . 15 In contrast to the wide variation in the occurrence of non-target tRNAs, we found that target tRNA 16 genes were largely stable irrespective of species' modification status (top row in each panel of Fig.  17 2). Contrary to expectation, the gain or loss of the (c)mnm5(s2)U and cmo5U modifications does 18 not appear to have any impact on target tRNAs ( Fig. 2A-2E ; p > 0.05, 2-sample proportions test); 19likely because the corresponding codons are still used in these species and cannot be decoded by 20 non-target tRNAs. In the case of the Q modification, target tRNAs were always present; but in 2 of 21 4 comparisons their copy number was lower in clades that had lost the ME ( Together, these results suggest that except for the I modification, the evolution of modifications had 27 no impact on the evolution of target tRNA genes. 28 29 Modification status is associated with tRNA diversity, GC content and genome size 30To identify the cause and impact of evolutionary changes in tRNA modifications, we compared key 31 translation-associated genomic features of sister clades with contrasting modification status. As 32 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/251322 doi: bioRxiv preprint shown above, we found that in 11 of 14 comparisons, the tRNA diversity of sister clades was 1 significantly different (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fig. 3 Fig. S3 ), indicating a strong 2 association between the evolution of modifications and the tRNA gene pool. However, in four of 3 these cases the direction of association opposed our initial expectation, and clades without the 4 modification had lower tRNA diversity (Figs. 3G, 3I, 3M and 3N). In three of these cases involving 5Tenericutes and the endosymbiotic species from Enterobacterales (Figs. 3G, 3I and 3M), we also 6 observed a significant reduction in the total number of tRNA genes (Fig. S3G , S3I, S3M), 7suggesting wide-ranging gene loss that is potentially a result of genome reduction in these clades. Bessho, 2013). Thus, overall half the sister clade comparisons supported our initial prediction that 11 the lack of modifications should be associated with greater tRNA diversity. Next, we tested whether 12 changes in modification status and tRNA genes were also associated with changes in GC content 13 and codon use. 14 In most cases showing altered tRNA diversity (8 out of 11), we found that the change in diversity 15 was also associated with significant shifts in GC content, so that species in clades without the tRNA 16 modification typically had more extreme GC3 values (i.e. GC content in the third base of codons, 17 biased codon use (measured as relative synonymous codon use RSCU for all proteins; p < 0.05, 20Wilcoxon rank sum test; we observed similar results for RSCU of highly expressed ribosomal 21 proteins; Fig. S3 ). Finally, in five of the eight cases we observed significant differences in genome 22 size across sister clades (Fig. 3 ). Of these, in the two comparisons that involved Actinobacteria 23 (Figs. 3A and 3F) we observed that larger genomes were associated with the absence of the 24 modification. As mentioned above, in the other three cases involving Tenericutes and 25Enterobacterales (Figs. 3G, 3I and 3M), the lack of modification may reflect overall genome 26 reduction. Note that in every comparison where codon use and genome size were different, GC 27 content was also skewed significantly. Thus, to test the overall effect of genome size and GC 28 content on modification status, we carried out a phylogenetic regression. We found that both GC 29 content and genome size had a significant effect on the presence/absence of the Q modification 30 alone ( Fig S4) . These results suggest that except for the Q modification, modifications were lost in 31 only a few instances of shifts in GC content. Thus, GC content may be the major ultimate driver of 32 changes in tRNA gene content and the subsequent loss of modification may generate selection to fix 33 these changes. Altogether, three of the 14 major changes in modification status were not associated 34 with significant shifts in either tRNA or GC content, and remain unexplained. These included one 35 .

As expected, following major GC shifts, non-target tRNA showed several gain/loss 5 events whereas target tRNA were more stable (Figs. 4-6). As suggested by our sister clade 6 comparison, in some cases modification gain or loss was also preceded by a GC shift (8 out of 14 7 independent lineages). Moreover, a phylogenetic regression to test the impact of GC and MEs on 8 tRNA genes revealed that GC content had the strongest impact on the dynamics of non-target tRNA 9 genes (Fig. 7) . However, as observed in the sister clade comparison, the phylogenetic regression 10 and mapping also reveal clear instances of GC-independent impacts of modification status on tRNA 11 genes (Figs. 4-7). The strongest impact of tRNA modification is observed the case of the Inosine, 12where the target tRNA was present in all species when the modification was present (Fig. 6) ; and 13 the non-target tRNA were absent in most of these species (Fig. 2D ). On the other hand, the loss of 14 target tRNAs and presence of non-target tRNAs is strongly associated with the loss of the Inosine 15 modification (Fig. 2D, Fig. 6, Fig. 7) . Thus, the bacterial tRNA repertoire is strongly affected by 16 evolutionary changes in GC content as well as tRNA modifying enzymes.

Interestingly, we also uncovered instances where 3 changes in tRNA or GC content could not explain the evolution of tRNA modifying enzymes. In 4 some of these cases, we suspect that overall genome reduction may have led to the loss of the 5 modification; but three major cases of modification loss remain unexplained (loss of (c)mnm5(s2)U 6in Leuconostoc and I in Spirochaetes and ε-proteobacteria). Nonetheless, our results strongly 7 support the conclusion that ME evolution was dominated by frequent losses driven by weakened 8 selection. Note that reversing the direction of causality in our arguments would not make logical Our results were generally consistent with the prediction that a lack of specific tRNA modifications 17 should result in strong positive selection favoring the relevant non-target tRNAs. However, we also 18 observed some instructive exceptions to this pattern. For instance, comparing across sister clades, 19we found that ~33% of the species that do not have the cmo5U modification also lack at least one 20 non-target tRNA. This should pose a problem because codons recognized by the missing non-target 21 tRNAs cannot be decoded efficiently. However, we observed that these codons were significantly 22 depleted in these genomes, compared to species that retained the non-target tRNA (Fig. S5) . Thus, 23 these relatively rare codons may not pose a major problem even if they are inefficiently translated. 24It is also possible that these codons are decoded by the respective U-starting target tRNAs that can 25 pair with A, G or U ending codons (Grosjean et al., 2010) . This scenario is especially likely in 26 species where the Q modification is absent. Recall that all bacteria lack the non-target tRNA for this 27 modification; hence species without the Q modification should be unable to translate many codons. 28 We hypothesize that in species where both the Q modification as well as the non-target tRNA are 29 missing, there is an as yet undiscovered G::U wobble base pairing between the target tRNA and 30 codons complementary to the non-target tRNA in these species. 31Our analysis quantifies the role of specific tRNAs in the evolutionary dynamics of bacterial 32 translation, both as drivers of selection on tRNA modifications and as a means to rapidly respond to 33 shifts in genomic GC content. Specifically, we found that target tRNAs are evolutionarily largely 34 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

This 1 phylogeny was generated using an alignment of the 400 most conserved protein sequences across 2 all prokaryotes. We downloaded the phylogeny 3 (https://bitbucket.org/nsegata/phylophlan/wiki/bs_tree.reroot.nwk) and removed all archaea, as well 4 as bacteria whose genomes have not been fully sequenced. We pruned the tree further using a 5 distance based pruning function. Briefly, when closely related species had a pairwise phylogenetic 6 distance ≤0.03, we randomly sampled only one of these species. This allowed us to remove the 7 excessive representation of some highly sequenced genomes, such as several Escherichia coli 8 strains. This led to the final set of 1093 bacterial genomes that we used in our subsequent analyses. 9We downloaded the tRNA gene copy numbers for each of these genomes from the Genomic tRNA 10 database (Chan & Lowe, 2009) . For genomes where this information was not available, we 11 determined the tRNA gene copy numbers by running the program tRNAscan-SE (Lowe & Eddy, 12 1996) using the default parameters for bacterial genomes. The information for each of these 13 genomes was represented using different identifiers in the various databases that we used. This 14 information is consolidated in Table S1 , consisting of: i) species name according to NCBI 15 taxonomy, ii) NCBI accession number, iii) Phylogenetic tree tip label in the tree, iv) IMG database 16 identifier and v) Genomic tRNA database abbreviation.

However, tRNA with GNN anticodons (where N is any nucleotide) in each of these codon 3 boxes can also recognize NNU codons via G::U wobble pairing. Thus, we only focused on the non-4 target tRNA that have CNN anticodons (indicated in Fig. 1C) . 5Homology search for tRNA MEs 6 We determined the presence/absence of all known tRNA MEs in the 1093 bacterial genomes using 7Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches (S. Eddy, 1998) . First, we downloaded all available 8 reviewed protein sequences for each of the MEs from the UniProt-KB database. We created a 9 multiple sequence alignment using the t-coffee program (Notredame, Higgins, & Heringa, 2000) 10 with default parameters. We used this alignment to build an HMM profile, and then used the 11 ""hmmsearch"" command in the HMMER suite (S. R. Eddy, 2009 ) to detect the presence/absence of 12 each ME. We used the amino acid sequences of all proteins from the 1093 genomes (downloaded in 13November 2016 from the NCBI ftp site) as the sequence search space, and set all other parameters 14 to default. Each search generated a table with accession numbers of potential homologous hits with 15 a corresponding e-value and bit-score. There is no consensus in the field with respect to setting an 16 e-value cut-off to detect true homologs. Here, we present a slightly informative method of deciding 17 e-value cut-offs for detecting true homologs. To infer presence/absence with precision, we 18 implemented a dynamic e-value cut-off to eliminate spurious hits. We did this by plotting the 19 number of species in which the ME would be detected as we increased the e-value cut-off (Fig. S6) . 20 We observed stable plateaus where the number of species in which an ME was detected did not 21 change despite changing the e-value cut-off, suggesting that these represent robust e-value 22 thresholds. Thus, for each enzyme we set an enzyme-specific e-value cut-off as the first e-value at 23 the beginning of the most stable plateau (see Fig. S6 ). For each ME, homologous hits that had e-24 values lower than this cut-off were considered true homologues. However, in our initial analysis we did not find CmoA and CmoB homologs in these or related 28 species. A closer inspection of the Bacillus subtilis genome also did not reveal these enzymes, as 29 indicated in a previous report (Grosjean et al., 2014) . Instead, there were a few entries for these 30 enzymes in the UniProt database (each with a poor annotation score). We therefore tested whether 31 these enzymes are true homologs of the proteobacterial CmoA and CmoB, using homology 32 detection (using 'jackhmmer'). We observed that only the query organisms showed the presence of 33 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

A survey of the SEED database (Overbeek et al., 2005 ) also 1 revealed the absence of CmoA and CmoB in all but one Bacillus species. When we carried out a 2 blastp analysis using CmoA and CmoB enzymes from Escherichia coli in Mycobacterium bovis str. 3 BCG, we observed no significant hits for CmoA and no hits for CmoB with e-values < 5e-3. Thus, 4although the modification may exist in several species, we could not reliably identify homologs of 5 the proteobacterial CmoA and CmoB in other bacteria. 6Ancestral reconstruction of tRNA modifications, genomic GC content, and tRNA genes 7We built a presence-absence matrix for each ME and used the binary state of each ME to infer gain 8 or loss events along the phylogeny. We used the stochastic character mapping (Bollback, 2006) 9 function in the phytools package in R, with the following parameters: transition rate matrix 10 determination method -Bayesian MCMC, prior distribution on the root node of the tree -11 estimated, number of simulations -500. We fixed the number of simulations such that the posterior 12 probability that an enzyme is present for 100 randomly sampled nodes did not change (Fig. S7) . We 13 used the enzyme with the most variable presence/absence state (queG) for this analysis, and 14 assumed that calculations for all other enzymes would be more stable. The mapping resulted in 500 15 enzyme states at each node of the tree. We determined probabilities of each state at each node and 16 assigned the state that had a posterior probability of ≥ 0.7 (Fig. S8 ) as the state of the enzyme at that 17 node. In case the probability was < 0.7, we assumed the same state at the node as the preceding 18 node. To determine gain and loss of tRNA modification pathways, we marked the branch that 19 succeeded the gain or loss of all MEs for a given modification as the focal branch. Only these 20 events are described in this study; however, all data for each enzyme are shown in Fig. S1 . 21 We determined the GC content at each ancestral node in the bacterial phylogeny using the 22StableTraits program (Elliot & Mooers, 2014) with 10 million iterations and all other parameters set 23 to default. We then determined 20 nodes whose two immediate descendants had the largest 24 difference in GC. Each of these nodes had at least 10 descendant species. These nodes representing 25 major GC shifts are shown on the phylogeny along with the ancestral GC content (Figs. 4 -6) . 26 We determined the evolutionary history of tRNA gains and losses using a similar method as 27 described for MEs. However, in this case we carried out the ancestral reconstruction separately for 28 each bacterial family, which allowed us to account for family-specific rates of evolution of tRNA 29 genes. We used the ancestral state of each tRNA at the root of each bacterial family to infer the 30 tRNA gene content of the eubacterial ancestor. Briefly, we converted tRNA gene copy numbers for 31 all species into a binary vector by changing the state of tRNA genes with multiple copies to ""1"" i.e. 32 .

Identifying sister clades with contrasting modifying enzyme status 3

We identified clades where crucial enzymes for each tRNA modification were gained or lost, and 4 determined the closest sister clade where the state of modification was opposite to that of the focal 5 clade. We determined the sister clade agnostic of its taxonomic classification. We checked if there 6 were at least 5 descendant extant species in this clade for each gain or loss event. If this criterion 7was not met, we picked the next closest sister clade neighboring the common ancestor of the above 8 two clades. Within each clade, we excluded species that had an opposite state for any of the MEs 9 involved in each modification. We assigned the identity of the comparison group using the lowest 10 level of taxonomic classification that encompassed the focal species. inferred that the reduced model was sufficient to explain tRNA presence/absence, and hence had a 23 significant impact on the evolution of the tRNA.

"Abstract

The COVID-19 epidemic originated in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in December 2019 and has spread throughout China. Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy.We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level.

","Introduction

Since December 2019, an increasing number of atypical pneumonia cases caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in Wuhan City of Hubei Province, China 1 In the present study, we aim to describe the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak after 50 days of detection in the provinces outside Hubei. We also estimate changes in key time-to-event distributions and reproduction numbers to assess whether the strict control measures have been able to slow transmission.

Case definitions and surveillance

Since the outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases was detected in Wuhan at the end of December 2019, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) has launched a new surveillance system, first in Wuhan, then extended to the entire country, to record information on COVID-19 cases. Case definitions for suspected cases and laboratory-confirmed cases, and the description of the surveillance system have been published 1 and reported elsewhere 5 . Details are summarized in Appendix (page 2).In the first version of ""Guideline on diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP)"" issued by China CDC on January 15, 2020, a suspected NCIP case was defined as pneumonia that fulfilled clinical criteria (fever; radiographic findings of pneumonia; or normal or reduced white blood All rights reserved.

The subsequent two versions of case definitions issued on January 18 and 22, separately, removed one of the clinical criteria (i.e. no reduction in symptoms after antimicrobial treatment for 3 days following standard clinical guidelines) to accelerate identification of cases and revised the epidemiological link (e.g. a travel history to Wuhan or direct contact with patients from Wuhan who had fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of symptom onset, or to be a potential case in a cluster). In the fourth version issued on January 27, the clinical criteria was loosened to meet any two of the three prior clinical criteria (i.e. fever; radiographic findings of pneumonia; normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count at early stage of illness) while the epidemiological link added one more criteria (e.g. epidemiological link with confirmed COVID-19 case). In the fifth version issued on February 4, clinically-diagnosed cases were defined as suspected cases with radiographic findings of pneumonia, to be used exclusively in Hubei 7 .

S1 in Appendix).All rights reserved.

Individual information was extracted and entered into a structured database comprising demography, exposure and travel history, timeline from exposure, symptom onset, hospital admission, and date of official announcement (reporting date). Each individual record was extracted and entered by three coauthors and was cross-checked to ensure data accuracy.Conflicting information was resolved based on the data source (i). In this study, we used information on age, sex, location of detection, exposure history, dates of symptom onset, hospital admission, and official announcement. Details on the collection of individual data and assessment of completeness of variables used in the study are provided in Tab. S1-S2 in Appendix.We also validated our individual records against the official line lists obtained from the websites of Shandong Provincial Health Commission, Shenzhen Municipal Health Commission, and Hunan Provincial Health Commission for the key variables used in this study (see Tab. S3 in Appendix).

We used the date of one key change in case definition to divide the epidemic into two time periods. The first period runs from the emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan through to January 27, when the definition of suspected cases in the fourth version issued by China CDC was loosened to capture milder cases (radiographic evidence of pneumonia was no longer necessary, and epidemiological links extended to contact with confirmed cases). The second period runs from January 28 through to February 17. We performed statistical analyses of demographic and epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases stratified by the two epidemic periods.We estimated key epidemiologic parameters on time-to-event distributions for COVID-19 cases, including symptom onset to first healthcare consultation, hospital admission, and official announcement. We estimated the time from infection to symptom onset (incubation period) by analyzing COVID-19 cases with asserted epidemiological links (clusters) identified by prospective contact tracing. The date of presumed infection was estimated from cases' history of exposure, excluding cases with exposure to Wuhan. When multiple exposures were reported, we considered the interval between the first and last recorded dates of exposure. We fitted three parametric distributions (Weibull, gamma, and lognormal) to time-to-event data and selected the best fit based on the minimum Akaike information criterion (AIC). All rights reserved.

The serial interval is then estimated by fitting a gamma distribution to the lag between the dates of symptom onset of the primary and secondary cases (with no travel history to/from Wuhan/Hubei) across all clusters.By leveraging the estimated distribution of the serial interval, we provide estimates of the net reproduction number (Rt), which is the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical primary case at time t. Consecutive generations of cases arise after a period measured by the serial interval or by the generation time. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate Rt from the time series of symptom onset dates and the distribution of the serial interval 8, 9 . For this analysis, the last 9 days of the dataset were not considered to deal with the possible incompleteness of the dataset due to reporting delays. Details on the methodology are reported in the Appendix (page 18).Statistical analyses were performed with R (version 3.6.0). The reproduction number was estimated from a code in C language written by the authors and available upon request. All rights reserved.

The proportion of male cases decreased between the two epidemic periods (p<0.001), from 54% to 49%. As of February 17, 51% of cases were male (see Fig. S2 in Appendix).The presence of at least one known exposure was reported by 77% of cases. In A similar decreasing trend over time was observed for the interval from symptom onset to first healthcare consultation as well (Tab. 2).We analyzed the time interval from exposure to illness onset for 49 cases (with no travel history to/from Wuhan/Hubei ) identified by prospective contact tracing in 37 clusters. We estimated a mean incubation period of 5.2 days (95%CI:1.8-12.4), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 10.5 days.

These secondary cases were identified by prospective contact tracing of 28 clusters and had no travel history to Wuhan/Hubei (see Appendix, Fig. S4 ). One case who reported the onset of symptoms on the same day as the index case was dropped from the analysis (see Appendix, Tab. S10 and Fig. S5 for a sensitivity analysis) . Moreover, as we cannot exclude that a fraction of these secondary cases had a previous exposure to an unidentified infection source, we performed a sensitivity analysis by different levels of data censoring (see Appendix, pages 16 and 17). We estimate the serial interval to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 5.1 days (95%CI: 1.3-11.6). A comparison between the distribution of the incubation period and of the serial interval is reported in Fig. 2 .The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 are extremely different among the provinces outside Hubei.

The outbreak was mostly sustained by cases with travel history to/from Wuhan/Hubei (Fig. 3A) . In Hunan Province, we estimated Rt to be above the epidemic threshold for about two weeks with a peak value of 1.58 (95%CI: 1.29-1.92) considering an average serial interval of 5.9 days (Fig. 3B) . Shandong Province showed an longer period (more than two weeks) characterized by sustained local transmission and a larger peak value of Rt: 2.17 (95%CI: 1.69-2.76) considering an average serial interval of 5.9 days (Fig. 3C ). In these three locations, Rt remained steadily below the epidemic threshold since the end of January 2020 (Fig. 3A-C) . In general, we found that in all the analyzed areas (8 out of 9 most affected provinces outside Hubei and one additional location), Rt was below the epidemic threshold as of February 8.

Discussion

We have provided an assessment of the rapidly changing epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak beyond Hubei Province in mainland China. We found significant differences in the epidemiology of COVID-19 as the epidemic continues to spread across China. Most importantly, as of February 8, 2020, we estimate the net reproduction number to be below the epidemic threshold in the provinces that have reported the largest number of All rights reserved.

As the epidemic progressed, we observed a shift towards younger (<18 years) and older (65+ years) cases. Since January 28, 2020, however, the proportion of confirmed cases aged <18 years is still only about 5%, although this age group represents approximately 20% of the Chinese population. From the data available here, it is not possible to distinguish whether younger individuals have a reduced risk of infection or a propensity for milder clinical outcome given infection (thus resulting in a lower risk of detection). It should also be considered that schools in China were closed for most of the epidemic due to the 2020 Chinese New Year holidays 11 . It is unclear whether nationwide school breaks could have contributed to the low proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases among school-age individuals, and whether schools reopening will lead to a change in the transmission patterns of COVID-19.At the very beginning of the epidemic, a disproportionate faction of COVID-19 cases were male 10 .

This suggests either differential exposure by sex occurring at the beginning of the epidemic (most of cases reported possible exposure to live markets 12, 13 ) or possible bias in the detection of the first few cases.In the provinces outside Hubei we estimate the incubation period to be 5.2 days on average, in agreement with previous studies 5, 14 . The 95 th percentile of the distribution (10.5 days) suggests the importance of contact tracing and medical observations for those with long incubation period.In the provinces outside Hubei we estimate the serial interval to be on average 5.1 days (95%CI: 1.3-11.6). This estimation is considerably shorter than the preliminary estimate derived from the analysis of six serial intervals in Wuhan 5 .This may be linked to the short time interval from symptom onset to hospital admission (about 2.6 days on average since January 28) we have estimated for mainland China outside Hubei, as compared to what was measured in Wuhan in the early phase of the outbreak 5 , which could have prevented longer serial intervals from being observed.

"Abstract

Recently developed quantitative redox proteomic studies enable the direct identification of redox-sensing cysteine residues that regulate the functional behavior of target proteins in response to changing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). At the molecular level, redox regulation can directly modify the active sites of enzymes, although a growing number of examples indicate the importance of an additional underlying mechanism that involves conditionally disordered proteins. These proteins alter their functional behavior by undergoing a disorder-to-order transition in response to changing redox conditions. However, the extent to which this mechanism is used in various proteomes is currently unknown. Here, we use a recently developed sequence-based prediction tool incorporated into the IUPred2A web server to estimate redox-sensitive conditionally disordered regions on a large scale. We show that redox-sensitive conditional disorder is fairly widespread in various proteomes and that its presence strongly correlates with the expansion of specific domains in multicellular organisms that largely rely on extra stability provided by disulfide bonds or zinc ion binding. The analyses of yeast redox proteomes and human disease data further underlie the significance of this phenomenon in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes, as well as its biomedical importance.

","Introduction

The key to the extraordinary versatility of proteins lies in their specific structural properties that precisely suit their individual functions. For example, enzymes typically need to adopt a welldefined conformation that ensures the correct orientation of their active site residues, as required for optimal catalytic activity. In contrast, intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions (IDPs/IDRs) lack a well-defined structure in isolation, and are best characterized by an ensemble of rapidly interconverting conformations [1] . The specific structural properties of IDPs enable them to carry out a different set of functions, which could not be fulfilled by relatively rigid globular domains [2, 3] . As a result, the function of many IDPs directly originates from their high intrinsic flexibility, enabling them to act as linkers or spacers [3, 4] . However, there is an emerging understanding that the structural behaviour of IDPs is often context-dependent: a disorder-to-order or order-to-disorder transition can be induced as a result of binding to specific macromolecular partners, undergoing post-translational modifications, or changes in environmental factors such as pH and temperature [5] . Recently, redox conditions have emerged as another important factor that can regulate conditional disorder [6] . The growing number of examples of redox-regulated conditionally disordered proteins indicates that this is an important mechanism triggered in response to various forms of oxidative stress or to naturally occurring changes in redox potential [6, 7] .Redox regulation is essential for the survival of all organisms, as cells constantly encounter the transient accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS may be generated exogenously or endogenously due to metabolic activity or inflammation, while subsequent oxidative damage can cause widespread protein unfolding and aggregation. It may also contribute to the pathogenesis of many different diseases, as well as to degenerative processes associated with aging. However, ROS can also serve as cellular signaling molecules and regulate various biological processes such as the immune response, cell proliferation, development, and more [8, 9] . The specific effects of ROS are captured in large part through the covalent and reversible modifications of specific cysteine residues, which can in turn modify the structural or functional properties of the redox-sensitive target proteins. Such post-translational modifications are tightly regulated by changes in levels of diverse physiological oxidants and is generally faster than expression of specific regulatory proteins. Over the last decade, numerous examples of such thiol-switch proteins have been uncovered, spanning different functions and regulation modes [6, 7, 10] . The functions of select proteins were found to be regulated by oxidative modifications of a specific cysteine thiol forming either sulfenic (e.g., in 1-Cys peroxiredoxin) or sulfenamide (e.g., in tyrosine phosphatase 1B, leading to regulation of the Ras signaling pathway). Another more studied mode of activation is through disulfide bond formation by redox-sensitive cysteine residues, typically located in close proximity of each other. These disulfide bridges can either promote disorder-to-order transitions (e.g., chloroplast regulator of the calvin cycle, CP12 [11] and cell growth modulator, granulin Grn-3 [12] ) or vice versa (e.g., in the bacterial protein chaperone Hsp33 [13] and mammalian copper chaperone Cox17 [14] ) in response to shifts in the cellular redox status [6] .The growing interest in redox regulation has motivated the development of various proteomics approaches that can be used to explore the landscape of thiol redox modifications. These methods usually involve a differential modification of the thiol groups by specific probes which labell reduced thiolate groups. Since the oxidized cysteines do not interact with these probes, the typical workflow involves an initial modification of all reduced thiols in the cell proteome, followed by reduction and then labeling with the second probe which differs in mass from the first. Thus, reduced and oxidized cysteines can be differentially labeled in a ratiometric manner, allowing for quantitative analysis of reversible oxidation modification of thiol groups. One of these approaches is based on the differential labeling by N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) and N- (6- (biotinamido)hexyl)-3′(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (biotin-HPDP), which enables the analysis mainly of the reversibly oxidized thiols [15] . In contrast, the OxICAT methodology is based on differential labeling of reduced and oxidized cysteines with isotopically light and heavy forms of the isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT) reagent, derivatives of the iodoacetamide alkylation reagent [16] . The usage of two differential isotopes provides quantification of the degree of oxidation among thousands of specific cysteine residues within the analyzed proteome in a highly precise manner. OxICAT has thus far been applied to proteomes (redoxomes) of diverse organisms under different physiological conditions [17] [18] [19] [20] .Using redox proteomics studies, the cellular redox state has thus far been revealed to either directly or indirectly affect a wide range of physiological processes in the cell. However, proteomics studies provide no information about the underlying mechanisms of thiol modifications, nor to what degree the detected thiol modifications correspond to redox-regulated conditional disorder. In order to explore this aspect of redox regulation, we took advantage of a recently introduced new feature of the IUPred method (IUPred2A) that enables the sequence based prediction of regions that are likely to undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon redox changes [21] . IUPred is a robust sequence-based prediction method for protein disorder that uses an energy estimation method [22] . The strength of the method originates from its ability to capture the basic biophysical properties of disordered segments: their inability to form enough stabilizing interactions to adopt a well-defined globular structure. The core of the method is a statistical potential that assigns more favorable scores to amino acid pairs that are observed more frequently in the proximity of each other within the structure of globular proteins, as compared to a background model. In this regard, cysteine residues clearly stand out, as they often form covalent contacts with other cysteines, thus providing large stabilizing contributions either by forming disulfide bridges or coordinating Zn 2+ and other metal ions. Consequently, the cysteine residues have a strong order promoting character in IUPred. However, thiol modifications of either paired or single cysteine residues may lead to a reversible order-todisorder transformation, exposing unfolded regions crucial for protein function [6, 7] . This regulatory effect of redox conditions on protein structure not only follows the presence of oxidation sensitive cysteine residues, but is also influenced by the presence of disorderpromoting residues in the surrounding sequence. In such cases, cysteine residues may simply be considered small, polar residues akin to serine, located within a sequence region exhibiting distinct features. The prediction of redox-sensitive disordered regions is based on capturing this dual characteristics of cysteines. This novel method opens new doors to explore redox-sensitive conditionally disordered segments in various proteomes.Here, we apply our method to predict redox-sensitive disordered regions on a large scale. We analyze the occurrence of these segments in known structures, and connect them to structural and functional features. In order to explore evolutionary trends of redox-sensitive conditionally disordered regions, we estimate their abundance at the proteome level and analyze their enrichment in terms of domains and biological processes. By taking advantage of recent mass spectrometry-based techniques applied to the exploration of redox-sensitive thiols, we can highlight proteins that are likely to use disorder-to-order transition to respond to redox changes in biological settings. We have used experimentally derived datasets generated by two different redox probes: either ICAT (used in the OxICAT redox proteomic method) [16] or biotin-HPDP [15] . Finally, by analyzing disease data, we collected examples of genetic mutations that alter the behaviour of putative redox-sensitive regions.

I. Prediction of redox-sensitive structural switches in proteins for known examples

Redox-dependent disorder-to-order transitions have been described in detail in only a few cases [6, 7] . For this reason, rigorous benchmarking on a large number of positive and negative data is not possible for the prediction of redox-sensitive structural transitions. Instead, IUPred2A was established and is further customized in this study, to best describe the available experimentally verified examples. The prediction is based on the generation of two prediction profiles, one using the original amino acid sequence (redox_plus, assuming cysteine stabilization) and one with mutating each cysteine to serine (redox_minus, corresponding to the lack of cysteine stabilization). While the prediction scores would differ for any sequences containing cysteines, in most cases, no changes in the overall order-disorder tendency would be observed. Our hypothesis was that in the cases of sequences that undergo disorder-to-order transition upon changes in redox conditions, a pronounced shift could be observed with the redox_plus profile predicted as ordered, and the redox_minus profile predicted as disordered. Redox-sensitive regions involved in this type of transition are predicted based on the observed divergence of the two profiles (See Data and Methods).The performance of our prediction method is illustrated through three interesting cases. One of the best characterized examples include the Hsp33 heat shock protein from E. coli. This protein chaperone forms a well-defined structure under reducing conditions with the N-terminal domain in close contact with the adjacent linker region and Zn 2+ binding C-terminal domain [27] . However, substrate binding is inaccessible in this conformation and consequently, the protein lacks chaperone activity [13] . Oxidative unfolding (oxidation coupled with mild protein destabilization conditions) causes the C-terminal region to release the Zn 2+ ions, inducing the unfolding of the C-terminal domain together with the adjacent linker region. This transition exposes the substrate binding sites that makes the protein active [28, 29] . The critical region for redox-sensing is located between resides 230 and 266, which contains the four highly conserved cysteine residues that coordinate the Zn 2+ ion under reducing conditions, but form short-range disulfide bonds under oxidative conditions. The large part of the experimentally determined redox-sensitive region is correctly identified by IUPred2A ( Figure 1 ) [30, 31] .Another prototypical example of redox-regulated disorder-to-order transitions is COX17, a ~60 residue copper chaperone which is one of the 13 subunits of the mammalian cytochrome c oxidase complex. This protein is disordered under the reducing conditions of the cytosol, in which it is synthesized, and its disordered nature is essential for its diffusion across the mitochondrial outer membrane [14, 32, 33] . However, upon its entry into the oxidizing environment of intermembrane space of the mitochondria, COX17 undergoes a disorder-toorder transition, and its folding proceeds by sequential disulfide formation and association with the Mia40 protein. In agreement with experimental data, the whole protein -apart from its signal sequence -is predicted to undergo a disorder-to-order transition upon changes of redox potential.The redox-regulated order-to-disorder transition in the case of Hsp33 and the disorder-to-order transition of COX17 produce the active form of the proteins, however, such transitions can also be part of more complex regulatory mechanisms. For example, the cytoplasmic tail of T cell coreceptors CD4 and CD8 associate with the N-terminus of the Src-family tyrosine kinase Lck. These interactions are critical for T cell development and activation. The interacting tail regions of both CD4 and Lck were shown to be intrinsically disordered in isolation, yet assemble to a form a zinc clasp structure [34] . Interestingly, the interaction is also regulated at the level of alternative splicing [35] . The interaction prevents the internalization and degradation of CD4 by masking the dileucine motif required for the clathrin-mediated endocytosis [34] . While there is no direct evidence for redox regulation of this complex, activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells is associated with the intracellular increase of reactive oxygen species and release of zinc [36] . This suggests that the Lck-CD4 complex could be considered as an additional example of the redox-regulated conditional disorder. 

II. Redox-sensitive conditionally disordered regions in the PDB

The number of fully characterized redox-induced folding/unfolding examples are rather limited. However, the developed method can be further characterized and refined using the vast amount of information encoded in protein structures containing either oxidized or reduced forms of cysteines in the PDB. To this end, we collected structures from the PDB using a filtering of 40% sequence identity. The predictions were run using the sequence from the corresponding PDB file. The presence of disulfide bonds was calculated from the atomic coordinates. However, cysteine residues that are involved in coordinating metal ions are also often located in close proximity. Such clusters were also identified based on the coordinates (see Data and Methods). The statistics for each PDB chain in the non-redundant dataset is given in the supplementary material. Redox-sensitive regions were predicted for 711 out of 14,145 structures, representing only 5.02% of cases ( Figure 2A ). Most of the redox-sensitive regions corresponded to structures stabilized by disulfide bridges (417, 2.95 %), or cysteine clusters, coordinating either Zn 2+ , Cu 2+ or Fe 2+ clusters (214, 1.51%). However, 1,566 structures with disulfide bonds and 344 structures with cysteine clusters did not contain predicted redox-sensitive structural switches. In general, structures with redoxsensitive regions had a higher number of disulfide bonds or cysteine clusters ( Figure 2B and 2C).While disulfide bridges usually from under oxidative conditions, metal binding is more common in reducing environment. Consequently, these structural features are usually complementary and there are only, a few structures contained both cysteine clusters and disulfide bonds. While in certain cases the disulfide bond formation could be a crystallization artefact (e.g.2g45), in many cases, the complementary nature of metal binding and disulfide bond formation can ensure a stable structure under a variety of conditions. As a counterpoint to structures with both of the stabilizing features, a relatively small number of predicted proteins (88, 0.62%) did not have either. The majority of these structures describe heme binding proteins, which rely on heme groups coordinated partially by cysteines for their stability, and might in fact be involved in redox regulation [37] . However, disorder-to-order transitions are not necessarily coupled to redox regulation. In general, examples without the capacity to form either disulfide bonds or cysteine clusters are treated as likely false positives. However, the number of such cases in PDB structures represent less than 1% of all structures in our dataset ( Figure 2A ). The overall relatively low rate of predicted redox-sensitive conditionally disordered regions in known structures and their strong correlation with strongly stabilizing structural features add strong credibility to IUPred2A redox-sensitive predictions.III. Redox-sensitive structural switching correlates with evolutionary complexity IUPred2A is able to predict redox-sensitive protein regions based on sequences alone. This opens up the means of studying the large-scale distribution of such regions across several proteomes (see Data and Methods), to gain evolutionary insights into the emergence of redoxsensing structural switches. We assessed the fraction of proteins with redox-sensitive regions with a potential structural plasticity in reference proteomes from all three domains of life, as well as viruses ( Figure 3A ).Genome size generally reflects the average complexity of the domains of life. While the differences between specific organisms are obscured by the C-value paradox, generally viruses have the smallest genomes, followed by archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. This hierarchy is also reflected in the proteome sizes, albeit with large overlaps between various domains of life. However, the fraction of predicted redox-sensitive intrinsically disordered proteins (termed fredox, see Data and Methods) shows a distinctively different distribution. Bacteria feature the lowest fredox values, with over 90% of species having fredox<7%. In general, for unicellular organisms, fredox is below 10%, including almost all archaea and bacteria, together with some eukaryotes. In contrast, multicellular organisms are characterized by markedly higher fredox values, with some highly complex organisms reaching close to 30%. The steady increase of fredox with the increase of complexity is demonstrated by the comparison of the S. cerevisiae (fredox=7.2%), D. melanogaster (fredox=19.6%) and human proteomes (fredox=27.2%). This highlights that fredox values (as opposed to genome or proteome sizes) better reflect the apparent complexity of organisms.For complex organisms, the derivation of even the proteome size from the genome sequence is non-trivial [38] . This is further modulated by the presence of various isoforms; therefore in theory, fredox values could be highly dependent on the exact definition of the proteome used for calculations. However, testing for this effect showed that in reality the calculated fredox values are strikingly stable with respect to such variations in proteome definitions. The minimal proteome of D. melanogaster from UniProt contains 3,496 proteins, while the proteome featuring all isoforms contains 13,775 proteins. Despite this nearly 4-fold difference, both proteomes yield almost identical fredox values of 19.6% and 20.8%, respectively. This supports the robustness of fredox as a marker for organism complexity, with the largest breakpoint corresponding to the advent of multicellularity.Apart from multicellular eukaryotes, several viruses also exhibit high fredox values. In these cases, fredox values correlate with the complexity of the host, with most high fredox value viruses targeting complex eukaryotes, typically vertebrates. This correlation between host complexity and fredox value is also apparent for several unicellular eukaryotic pathogens. Both T. congolense and P. falciparum (the major causes of the sleeping sickness and malaria, respectively) are unicellular eukaryotes, and such their fredox values are expected to be below 10%, similarly to other organisms with comparable complexity and small proteome size. However, their fredox values rather resemble those of their hosts, with fredox=24.4% and 17.9%, respectively ( Figure 3A ). The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/412692 doi: bioRxiv preprint While the fraction of proteins incorporating redox-sensitive intrinsically disordered regions increases with organism complexity, the typical length of such regions is strikingly constant across various domains of life and viruses ( Figure 3B ). The typical region length is approximately 22 residues, and while eukaryotes have a slightly higher average region length, this is primarily a result of the high apparent length of tandem arrays of redox-sensing regions. This indicates that the basic molecular mechanisms behind redox-sensing structural switches are probably uniform across all life, and the emergence of complexity requires a larger number of proteins utilizing such mechanisms.In order to directly assess the structural units involved in redox-sensitive order-disorder transitions, we also analyzed the domains that overlap with the predicted regions in the three model organisms highlighted in Figure 3A (see Figure 3C ). In the yeast proteome, nearly all redox-sensitive structural switches are metal ion coordinating domains. The majority of these domains coordinate zinc ions, belonging to a handful of zinc finger domain types ( Figure 3D ). The transition into the realm of multicellular organisms brings about a drastic increase in the relative number of structural switches harboring zinc ion coordinating structural switches. While the ratio of proteome sizes for yeast vs. drosophila is only 2.3 (6,049 vs. 13,775), the ratio of the number of identified metal ion coordinating domains is about 4.5. Analysis of the drosophila proteome also demonstrates the emerging dominance of C2H2-type zinc fingers. In addition, the drosophila proteome also shows a striking increase in the number of disulfide-bound structural switches. In contrast to metal ion binding domains, however, the identified disulfide bonded domains are more evenly distributed across several types of domains. Considering the human proteome, the abundance of both types of structural switches are even higher. However, this increase is more pronounced for the metal ion binding domains, and is largely attributable to the drastic increase in the number of C2H2 type zinc finger domains. In comparison, extracellular, disulfide bonded domains remain fairly diversified across several domain types.Judging by sheer numbers of occurrence, the most abundant domain of interest in humans is the C2H2 zinc finger. This structural unit is present in all three studied proteomes in high numbers. Furthermore, the ratio of conditionally disordered C2H2 domains compared to the total number of such domains is surprisingly stable across the three organisms, with values of 59.5%, 66.6%, and 53.9%, for yeast, drosophila and human. This indicates that the study of the redox-sensitivity of simple model organisms, such as yeast can have implications in human physiology as well. The identification and functional characterization of redox-sensing structural switches can therefore serve as a guide to the understanding of the more complex roles these protein regions play in human regulation.

IV. Comparison with redox proteomics datasets in yeast

We analyzed three datasets of S. cerevisiae proteins containing modified cysteines identified using redox proteomics. In the first case, 27 proteins were identified harboring reversiblyoxidized cysteines using biotin-HPDP-based redox proteomics [15] . The biotin-HPDP-based method identifies only cysteines that were oxidized in the protein lysate. On the other hand, the other two datasets were obtained using the OxICAT method, which analyses all cysteines, and provides degree of oxidation of the identified cysteines (reduced and oxidized in the protein lysate), focusing on a wider range of cysteine containing peptides. The second study applied quantitative redox proteomics based on the OxICAT approach [39] and identified 41 proteins that underwent substantial thiol modifications as a result of H2O2 treatment. Using similar thiol labeling but different mass spectrometry workflow, the third study identified 47 unique proteins with redox-active thiols [40] . Strikingly, there was very limited overlap between these datasets. Only five proteins were common between the first two studies (TRP5, TEF1, FBA1, ARO4 and AHP1), and only a single protein (RPL37B) was shared between the second and third studies, with no overlap between the first and third studies. This small overlap among the three studies seems to indicate limitations in terms of the currently applied techniques' sensitivity, as well as technical and biological variabilities.The structural/functional consequences of cysteine modifications identified in these experiments can be heterogeneous, and not all of them are expected to induce a transition in the structural state of the affected region. Nevertheless, in several cases, the identified proteins with modified cysteines overlapped with predicted conditionally disordered regions. As these predictions suggest a specific mechanism underlying the redox-sensitivity, we took a closer look at these examples (Table 1 ). In one example, the GAS1 protein is anchored to the plasma membrane and to the cell wall. In addition to the catalytic glucanosyltransferase domain, it also contains a cysteine rich domain. The redox-sensitivity of these cysteines in not easy to explain, as they are required for the normal folding and stability of the protein [41] . An interesting case corresponds to YDJ1, a yeast homolog of the chaperone DnaJ, a zinc containing co-chaperone, involved in mitochondrial protein import. The central cysteine-rich domain, which contains four repeats of the motif CXXCXGXG, is predicted as conditionally disordered. Its redox-sensitivity suggests that it could be involved in oxidative-stress response, similarly to Hsp33. The validity of the prediction is supported by the notion that redox regulation was established for the human homologue of DnaJ [42] .Several members of the ribosome were also shown to be redox-sensitive, further containing predicted conditionally disordered regions. This group includes the mitochondrial Mrpl32, which was shown to undergo redox-dependent regulation [43] . Members of the cytosolic ribonucleoprotein complex were also included in this group (RPL37A, RPL37B, RPS29A, RPS29B, RPL40A, RPL40B). In addition, MAK16 is involved in the biogenesis of the ribosomal large subunit in the nucleolus. The common structural theme among these proteins is Zn 2+ binding, typically involving a specific zinc finger class, called treble clefs. Additional members of the translation machinery are also candidates for redox-regulated conditional disorder mediated by their Zn 2+ binding domains, such as Taf1 and Elf1. Taf1 is a zinc knuckle that plays a central role in TFIID promoter binding and regulation of transcription initiation [44] . Elf1 is a conserved transcription elongation factor that contains a putative zinc binding domain with four conserved cysteines [45] . Another Zn 2+ binding protein, Gis2 interacts with the mRNA translation machinery and is a component of the stress induced RNP granules [46] . NRP1 also belongs to the group of Zn 2+ finger proteins, with a currently uncharacterized RNA binding function, also localizing to stress granules. From a functional point of view, the redox-sensitivity of these proteins can play a critical role in the global attenuation of translation in response to oxidative stress [40] . Further candidates for redox-regulated conditional disorder include other Zn 2+ binding proteins, such as the DNA damage-responsive transcriptional repressor RPH1, Pre-mRNA-splicing factor RDS3 and DNA-directed RNA polymerases I, II, and III subunit RPABC4 (Table 1) .In contrast to the other examples, redox-sensitive cysteines in Pet191 are likely to form disulfide bonds when it is located in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria. This protein is a cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor with a similar twin-Cx9C motif, similar to that found in Cox17. The disulfide bond formation is required for cell viability and assembly of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, however the protein may be imported into the mitochondria, independently of the mitochondrial MIA40-ERV1 machinery [47] . This difference could explain why this protein was found to be redox-sensitive, while other members of the COX family were not detected as such. V. Functional repertoire of redox-sensitive structural switches in the human proteome Yeast proteomics results highlight some key molecular mechanisms in which redox-sensitive conditional disorder plays functional roles, most notably in stress response, biogenesis, and the regulation of transcription and translation. These results indicate that these structural switches preferentially contribute to the actuation of certain biological processes. While yeast proteomics can highlight certain functions also present in higher order organisms, biological processes that are unique to higher order multicellular organisms can only be uncovered via the direct analysis of the functional annotations of their proteomes.The characteristic functional repertoire of human redox-sensitive conditionally disordered proteins was assessed using Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis. We identified terms that are significantly enriched in the set of predicted conditionally disordered proteins compared to the full human proteome (see Data and Methods). Relevant GO terms were divided into four groups, termed slims, to separately highlight basic molecular (GO molecular slim), network/pathway level (GO network slim), cellular level (GO cell slim), and organism level biological processes (GO organism slim).Molecular level functions highlight that the dominant processes uncovered by yeast proteomics are also heavily associated with redox-sensitive conditional disorder in the human proteome. These processes are linked to the regulation of transcription and translation, and are dominated by intracellular proteins. Consequently, the corresponding GO terms are clearly linked to metal ion coordinating regions. In addition, these structural elements are also associated with the biosynthesis of several organic compounds, processes that are largely absent from the results of yeast proteomics. While corresponding processes do exist in yeast, they involve only a very limited number of proteins in contrast to the similar function in humans (e.g. 'nucleobasecontaining compound metabolic process' covering only 7 yeast proteins [48] ). A separate class of GO molecular slim terms correspond to the multicellular-specific metabolism and organization of the extracellular matrix in general, and collagen fibrils in particular. These processes are clearly dominated by extracellular proteins, and are thus strongly associated with redoxsensitive disulfide bridge forming protein regions.Analysis of network level processes shows that redox-sensitive conditionally disordered proteins are heavily involved in the regulation of key processes. Cell growth is governed by several signals, and the processing of various growth factors (such as TGFbeta) and retinoic acid is clearly dependent on conditional disorder, with a slight preference for disulfide bonded proteins. In contrast, steroid hormone signal processing mainly involves intracellular, metal ion coordinating structural switches. Generic cell-cell communication involving various members of the integrin receptor family relies on a balanced mix of disulfide bonded and metal ion coordinating structural elements. A clear exception to this rule is the interaction between nerve cells, as the assembly and organization of synapses very heavily utilizes extracellular conditionally disordered proteins, stabilized by disulfide bonds.These molecular and network level processes enable characteristic cellular functions that are typically centered around cell movement, growth, differentiation, and proliferation. The majority of these processes require the coordination between various pathways and utilize several .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/412692 doi: bioRxiv preprint molecular processes. As a result, these processes typically show very little preference for either of the two types of redox-sensitive structural switches. The two main exceptions to this rule are cell movement via chemotaxis, which mostly involves mostly disulfide bonded extracellular proteins, and stem cell division and population maintenance, mostly relying on metal ion coordinating cysteine clusters.At the organism level, the cellular functions involving redox-regulated conditionally disordered protein regions are typically embedded in a wide variety of developmental processes. Several of these processes are focused on either reproduction, such as the formation of a labyrinthine layer"
"Abstract

SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency. 1 Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. 2 Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3'fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anticoronavirus agents.The recent appearance of a new coronaviral infection, COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, and its worldwide spread, has made international headlines. Already more than 3,000 deaths have been ascribed to this virus, and COVID-19 has reached near pandemic status. The virus has been isolated from the lower respiratory tracts of patients with pneumonia, sequenced and visualized by electron microscopy. 1 The virus, designated SARS-CoV-2, is a new member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, but is distinct from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. 1 The coronaviruses are single strand RNA viruses, sharing properties with other single-stranded RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus, Marburg virus, HIV virus, Ebola virus, dengue virus, and rhinoviruses. In particular, coronaviruses and HCV are both positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses, 3,4 and thus have a similar replication mechanism requiring a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).The coronavirus life cycle has been described. 3 Briefly, the virus enters the cell by endocytosis, is uncoated, and ORF1a and ORF1b of the positive strand RNA is translated to produce nonstructural protein precursors, including a cysteine protease and a serine protease; these further cleave the precursors to form mature, functional helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A replication-transcription complex is then .

formed, which is responsible for making more copies of the RNA genome via a negative-sense RNA intermediate, as well as the structural and other proteins encoded by the viral genome. The viral RNA is packaged into viral coats in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex, after which exocytosis results in release of viral particles for subsequent infectious cycles. Potential inhibitors have been designed to target nearly every stage of this process. 3 However, despite decades of research, no effective drug is currently approved to treat serious coronavirus infections such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.One of the most important druggable targets for coronaviruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This polymerase is highly conserved at the protein level among different positive sense RNA viruses, to which coronaviruses and HCV belong, and shares common structural features in these viruses. 5 Like RdRps in other viruses, the coronavirus enzyme is highly error-prone, 6 which might increase its ability to accept modified nucleotide analogues. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogues that inhibit polymerases are an important group of anti-viral agents. [7] [8] [9] [10] Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. 2 Sofosbuvir is a pyrimidine nucleotide analogue prodrug with a hydrophobic masked phosphate group enabling it to enter infected eukaryotic cells, and then converted into its active triphosphate form by cellular enzymes (Fig. 1 ). In this activated form, it inhibits the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B. 11, 12 The activated drug (2'-F,Me-UTP) binds in the active site of the RdRp, where it is incorporated into RNA, and due to fluoro and methyl modifications at the 2' position, inhibits further RNA chain extension, thereby halting RNA replication and stopping viral growth. It acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor by competing with natural ribonucleotides. Velpatasvir inhibits NS5A, a key protein required for HCV replication. NS5A enhances the function of RNA polymerase NS5B during viral RNA synthesis. 13, 14 Fig. 1 | Conversion of Sofosbuvir to active triphosphate (2'-F,Me-UTP) in vivo to inhibit viral polymerases. Adapted from 11 There are many other RNA polymerase inhibitors that have been evaluated as antiviral drugs. A related purine nucleotide prodrug, Remdesivir (Fig. 2b) , was developed by Gilead to treat Ebola virus infections, though not successfully, and is currently in clinical trials for treating COVID-19. 15, 16 In contrast to Sofosbuvir (Fig. 2a) , both the 2'-and 3'-OH groups in Remdesivir (Fig. 2b) are unmodified, but a cyano group at the 1' position serves to inhibit the RdRp in the active triphosphate form. In addition to the use of hydrophobic groups to mask the phosphate in the Protide-based prodrug strategy, 17 as with Sofosbuvir and Remdesivir, there are other classes of nucleoside prodrugs including those based on ester derivatives of the ribose hydroxyl groups to enhance cellular delivery. 18,19 The replication cycle of HCV 4 is very similar to that of the coronaviruses. 3 Analyzing the structure of the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (Fig. 2a) compared to that of Remdesivir (Fig. 2b) , both of which have already been shown to inhibit the replication of specific RNA viruses (Sofosbuvir for HCV, Remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2), we noted in particular that the 2'-modifications in Sofosbuvir (a fluoro and a methyl group) are substantially smaller than the 1'-cyano group and the 2'-OH group in Remdesivir. The bulky cyano group in close proximity to the 2'-OH may lead to steric hindrance that will impact the incorporation efficiency of the activated form of Remdesivir. Interestingly, it was recently reported that, using the MERS-CoV polymerase, the triphosphate of Remdesivir was preferentially incorporated relative to ATP in solution assays. 20 Nevertheless, it has been shown that the active triphosphate form of Remdesivir does not cause complete polymerase reaction termination and actually delays polymerase termination in Ebola virus and respiratory syncytial virus, likely due to its 1'-cyano group and the free 2'-OH and 3'-OH groups. 20, 21 Compared to the active form of Sofosbuvir (2'-fluoro-2'-methyl-UTP), two other nucleotide inhibitors with related structures were reviewed: 2'-fluoro-UTP is incorporated by polymerase, but RNA synthesis may continue past the incorporated nucleotide analogue; 22 2'-C-methyl-UTP has been shown to terminate the reaction catalyzed by HCV RdRp, 22 but proofreading mechanisms can revert this inhibition in mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. 23 Additionally, HCV develops resistance to 2'-C-methyl-UTP due to mutations of the RdRp. 24 A computational study published in 2017 25 considered the ability of various anti-HCV drugs to dock in the active site of SARS and MERS coronavirus RdRps as potential inhibitors. Recently, Elfiky used a computational approach to predict that Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir might be potent drugs against . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.989186 doi: bioRxiv preprint Thus, based on our analysis of the biological pathways of hepatitis C and coronaviruses, the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, model polymerase and SARS-CoV RdRp extension experiments described below, and the efficacy of Sofosbuvir in inhibiting the HCV RdRp, we expect that Sofosbuvir or its modified forms should also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. 2 The active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (2'-F,Me-UTP) was shown to be incorporated by HCV RdRp and prevent any further incorporation by this polymerase. 22, 27 Other viral polymerases have also been shown to incorporate active forms of various anti-viral prodrugs to inhibit replication. 28 Since, at the time of the preparation of this manuscript, we did not have access to the RdRp from SARS-CoV-2, we first selected two groups of polymerases to test the termination efficiency of the active form of Sofosbuvir, one group with high fidelity behavior with regard to incorporation of modified nucleotide analogues, which one would expect for host cell polymerases, the other group with low fidelity mimicking viral polymerases, as well as the RdRp from SARS-CoV, the virus causing the 2003 and subsequent outbreaks of SARS. Our rationale is that the low fidelity viral-like enzymes would incorporate 2'-F,Me-UTP and stop further replication, while the high fidelity polymerases, typical of host cell polymerases, would not. Experimental proof for termination of the SARS-CoV polymerase catalyzed RNA replication would provide further support for this rationale, indicating that Sofosbuvir or its modified forms will inhibit SARS-CoV-2.We first carried out DNA polymerase extension reactions with the active form of Sofosbuvir (2'-F,Me-UTP) using Thermo Sequenase as an example of high fidelity, host-like polymerases, and two mutated DNA polymerases which are known to be more promiscuous in their ability to incorporate modified nucleotides, Therminator II and Therminator IX, as examples of viral-like low fidelity enzymes. A DNA template-primer complex, in which the next two available bases were A (Fig. 3 ), was incubated with either 2'-F,Me-UTP (structure shown in Fig. 2a) , or dTTP as a positive control, in the appropriate polymerase buffer. If the 2'-F,Me-UTP is incorporated and inhibits further incorporation, a single-base primer extension product will be produced. By contrast, dTTP incorporation will result in primer extension by 2 bases. After performing the reactions, we determined the molecular weight of the extension products using MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).As seen in Figs. 3a and 3b, when the primer-template complex (sequences shown at top of Fig. 3 ) and 2'-F,Me-UTP were incubated with the low fidelity 9 o N polymerase mutants, 29-31 Therminator II (T2) and Therminator IX (T9), we observed single product peaks with molecular weights of 5492 Da and 5488 Da, indicating single base extension in the polymerase reaction. Thus 2'-F,Me-UTP was able to be incorporated and block further nucleotide incorporation. In contrast, when the extension reactions were carried out with high-fidelity Thermo Sequenase DNA polymerase (TS), 32 there was no incorporation, as evidenced by a single primer peak at 5172 Da (Fig. 3c ). This supports our rationale that Thermo Sequenase, a high fidelity enzyme originally designed for accurate Sanger sequencing, will not incorporate 2'-F,Me-UTP, while a lowfidelity polymerase, such as T2 and T9, will incorporate 2'-F,Me-UTP and stop further nucleotide incorporation. When dTTP was used as a positive control with these three enzymes, incorporation continued past the first A in the template, resulting in a higher molecular weight peak..

Fig. 3 | Incorporation of 2'-F,Me-UTP by two low-fidelity polymerases as terminators but not by a high-fidelity polymerase.

The sequence of the primer and template used for these extension reactions is shown at the top of the figure. Polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating the primer and template with 2'-F,Me-UTP and the appropriate reaction buffer for the specific enzyme, followed by detection of the reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS. The MS spectra for Therminator II (T2) in (a) and for Therminator IX (T9) in (b) indicates single-base incorporation and termination, while the MS spectrum for Thermo Sequenase (TS) in (c) indicates no incorporation, showing only a primer peak. The accuracy for m/z determination is ± 10 Da.These results demonstrate that lower fidelity polymerases will have a high likelihood of incorporating 2'-F,Me-UTP and inhibit viral RNA replication, whereas high fidelity enzymes, more typical of the host DNA and RNA polymerases, will have a low likelihood of being inhibited by 2'-F,Me-UTP. Anti-viral drug design based on this principle may lead to potent viral polymerase inhibitors with fewer side effects. To provide further proof that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp might be inhibited by 2'-F,Me-UTP, we next tested the ability of this molecule to be incorporated into an RNA primer to terminate the reaction catalyzed by the RdRp from SARS-CoV, using an RNA template. As shown in Fig. 4a , the active triphosphate form of the drug not only was incorporated by the RdRp, but prevented further incorporation, behaving as a terminator in the polymerase reaction.Based on our similar insight related to their molecular structures and previous antiviral activity studies, in comparison with Sofosbuvir, we selected the triphosphate forms of Alovudine (3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine) and azidothymidine (AZT, the first FDA approved drug for HIV/AIDS) for evaluation as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV RdRp. These two molecules share a similar backbone structure (base and ribose) to Sofosbuvir, but have fewer modification sites and less steric hindrance. Furthermore, because these modifications on Alovudine and AZT are on the 3' carbon in place of the OH group, they directly prevent further incorporation of nucleotides leading to permanent termination of RNA synthesis and replication of the virus. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.989186 doi: bioRxiv preprint Alovudine is one of the most potent inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase and HIV-1 replication. This promising drug was discontinued after a Phase II trial due to its hematological toxicity. 33 However, subsequent in vitro studies showed Alovudine was very effective at suppressing several nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant HIV-1 mutants. 34 New clinical studies were then carried out in which low doses of Alovudine were given as supplements to patients showing evidence of infection by NRTI resistant HIV strains and not responding well to their current drug regimen. A 4-week course of 2 mg/day Alovudine reduced viral load significantly, and was relatively well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events. 35 AZT is another antiretroviral medication which has long been used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. [36] [37] [38] Upon entry into the infected cells, similar to Alovudine, cellular enzymes convert AZT into the effective 5'triphosphate form (3'-N 3 -dTTP, structure shown in Fig. 2d ), which competes with dTTP for incorporation into DNA by HIV-reverse transcriptase resulting in termination of HIV's DNA synthesis. 39 Since the side effects and toxicity of AZT are well understood, novel methodologies have been directed at enhancing AZT plasma levels and its bioavailability in all human organs in order to improve its therapeutic efficacy. Among these possibilities, an AZT prodrug strategy was proposed. 40 We thus assessed the ability of 3'-N 3 -dTTP and 3'-F-dTTP, the active triphosphate forms of AZT and Alovudine, along with 2'-F,Me-UTP, to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp into an RNA primer and terminate the polymerase reaction.The RdRp of SARS-CoV, referred to as nsp12, and its two protein cofactors, nsp7 and nsp8, shown to be required for the processive polymerase activity of nsp12, were cloned and purified as described. 41, 42 These three viral gene products have high homology (e.g., 96% identity and 98% similarity for nsp12, with similar homology levels at the amino acid level for nsp7 and nsp8) to the equivalent gene products from SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. A detailed description of the homologies of nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 is included in Extended Data Fig. 1 which highlights key functional motifs in nsp12 described by Kirchdoerfer and Ward. 42 Of these, Motifs A, B, E, F and G are identical in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at the amino acid level, and Motifs C and D display only conservative substitutions.We performed polymerase extension assays with 2'-F,Me-UTP, 3'-F-dTTP, 3'-N 3 -dTTP or UTP following the addition of an pre-annealed RNA template and primer to a pre-assembled mixture of the RdRp (nsp12) and two cofactor proteins (nsp7 and nsp8). The extended primer products from the reaction were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. The RNA template and primer, corresponding to the N1 epitope region of the N protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, were used for the polymerase assay, and their sequences are indicated at the top of Fig. 4 . Because there are two As in a row in the next available positions of the template for RNA polymerase extension downstream of the priming site, if the 2'-F,Me-UTP, 3'-F-dTTP or 3'-N 3 -dTTP are incorporated by the viral RdRp, a single nucleotide analogue will be added to the 3'-end of the primer strand. If they are indeed inhibitors of the polymerase, the extension should stop after this incorporation; further 3'extension should be prevented. In the case of the UTP control reaction, two UTP's should be incorporated. As shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2 , this is exactly what we observed. In the MALDI-TOF MS trace in Fig. 4a, a peak In summary, these results demonstrate that the nucleotide analogues 2'-F,Me-UTP, 3'-F-dTTP and 3'-N 3 -dTTP, are permanent terminators for the SARS-CoV RdRp. Their prodrug versions (Sofosbuvir, 3'-F-5'-Ophosphoramidate dT nucleoside and 3'-N 3 -5'-O-phosphoramidate dT nucleoside) can be readily synthesized using the ProTide prodrug approach, as shown in Fig. 2a, c and d, and can be developed as therapeutics for both SARS and COVID-19.

The sequence of the primer and template used for these extension reactions, which are within the N1 coding sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, is shown at the top of the figure. Polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating (a) 2'-F,Me-UTP, (b) 3'-F-dTTP, and (c) 3'-N 3 -dTTP with pre-assembled SARS-CoV polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated RNA template and primer, and the appropriate reaction buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by MALDI-TOF MS. The detailed procedure is shown in the Methods section. For comparison, data for extension with UTP are presented in Extended Data Fig. 2 . The accuracy for m/z determination is ± 10 Da.One factor that has confounded the development of RdRp inhibitors in coronaviruses is the presence of a 3'exonuclease-based proofreading activity such as that associated with nsp14, a key component of the replication-transcription complex in SARS-CoV, 43, 44 and also encoded in SARS-CoV-2. This exonuclease activity can be overcome with the use of 2'-O-methylated nucleotides. 43 Importantly, since both Sofosbuvir . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

We previously used this chemical and structural principle to select a variety of chemical moieties that block the 3'-OH of the nucleotide analogues as polymerase terminators. 31, 49, 50 In conclusion, we demonstrated the capability of more tolerant DNA polymerases, as well as SARS CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is nearly identical to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp responsible for COVID-19, to incorporate 2'-F,Me-UTP, the active form of Sofosbuvir, where it serves to terminate the polymerase reaction. We also showed two other nucleotide triphosphates, 3'-F-dTTP, the active form of Alovudine, and 3'-N 3 -dTTP, the active form of AZT, can also be incorporated and terminate further nucleotide extension by the RdRp in the polymerase reaction, potentially preventing further replication of the virus. Prodrug versions of these compounds and their derivatives therefore can be developed as potent broadspectrum therapeutics for coronavirus infectious diseases, including SARS, MERS and COVID-19. which is also less conservative in other coronaviruses. 5 Within the next region (the interface domain, aa ~250 .

These domains constitute the canonical fingers, palm, and thumb of the polymerase enzyme and contain several motifs that are conservative among coronaviruses (Motifs A through F).

"Abstract

Introduction: the current worldwide outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is seriously threatening the public health. The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirusmediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms' onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease.

","Introduction

The novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has been first identified in China in December 2019 [1] . As of today, more than 110,000 cases have been reported (with more than 4,000 deaths) and, while the majority of them is still concentrated in China, the infection has spread across the country's border to many Asian countries, as well as to Europe and to the USA [2]. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. The current outbreak would result from the acquired ability of the virus to undergo human to human transmission [3] , after the jump from the original animal reservoir (most likely a bat).In the human host, SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory syndrome (named which can range from a mild involvement of the upper airways to a severe pneumonia with Acute Respiratory Syndrome (ARS) and the need of mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). In early case series, the risk of critical care admission ranges between 5 and 26%, with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities or chronic diseases [4, 5] . The time from symptoms onset to development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long, with a median time of 8 days in which the patient remains in a state of mild disease characterized by dry cough, fever and mild hypoxia requiring oxygen supplementation. Once severe disease with the necessity of ICU develops, the outcome worsens decisively, with mortality raising from 3.4% to 61% [4, 6] . Moreover, ICU staying poses a serious strain on resource-limited hospitals. Thus, preventing disease progression during the mild phase would be highly desirable both in terms of morbidity and mortality improvement and healthcare resource-sparing. At the present time, there are no proven etiological treatments for COVID-19 but some ongoing clinical trials are testing the effects of anti-viral drugs (NCT04252664 on ClinicalTrials.gov).In 2004, a pilot study showed that low dose inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support during the SARS epidemic, sustained by another coronavirus, SARS-CoV [7] . In an in vitro study, the NO donor compound S-nitroso-Nacteylpenicillamine increased the survival rate in an in vitro model of SARS-CoV .

While further in-vitro testing for this specific virus is recommended, we propose a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing progression of COVID-19 disease, when administered at an early stage.

Study design

Multicenter randomized clinical trial. Symptoms of COVID-19 must include presence of fever of at least 36.6 °C from the axillary site or 37.2 °C from the oral site or 37.6 °C from the rectal / tympanic site.In addition, patient must be spontaneously breathing with a respiratory rate of at least 24 breaths per minute and/or an objective persistent cough consistent with COVID-19 symptoms..

Gas exchange and ventilation may be assisted by means of any continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system, or any system of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≤ 10 cmH2O.Criteria of exclusion are pregnancy (all women in fertile age should be tested for pregnancy before being enrolled); presence of an open tracheostomy; therapy with high-flow nasal cannula; clinical contraindication to NO gas delivery, as judged by the attending physician; hospitalized and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 for more than 72 hours.

A flowchart of the study is presented in Figure 2 .The evaluation of the patients will continue for 28 day after the enrollment.Since treatment with inhaled NO can lead to increase in plasmatic methemoglobin, the blood levels of methemoglobin will be monitored via non-invasive CO-oximeter or methemoglobin levels in blood. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the study, inhaled NO concentration will be immediately stopped until the subsequent dose. For safety reason we will also evaluate NO2 level in order to keep it below 5 ppm.If we observe an increase above this value, we will immediately interrupt the administration of NO until the subsequent dose.Patients assigned to the control group will not receive any gas therapy.

Outcomes

The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients who progress to a severe form of the disease, defined as the indication given by the attending physician to intubation and mechanical ventilation in the first 28 days after enrollment in the study. Patients in severe respiratory failure and/or ventilatory distress with indication to intubation but concomitant DNI (Do Not Intubate) will meet criteria for primary endpoint. The proportion of intubation will be calculated at 28 days from study enrollment. .

Data collection

Clinical information including medical history and laboratory exams will be obtained from the medical charts and prospectively recorded until discharge or death. Collection of study variables will be managed by the outcome assessors by using a dedicated patient's file on Studytrax. The 28 days follow up, if the patient is discharged from the hospital, will be performed by a phone call.Outcome assessors, treatment providers and the principal investigator will obtain unique usernames and password to transfer all data to a Studytrax page dedicated to the study. Data access is restricted only to authorized member of the team which will be responsible for strict confidentiality all times. The signed informed consent will be kept in a secure place for at least 5 years after study completion.

Sample size calculation

Based on previously published data on COVID 19 [4] , we predict an incidence of intubation and mechanical ventilation of 12.3%. However, because of the novel nature of this study, we do not have enough data to predict the effect of inhaled NO on the primary outcome. The dynamic trend of this ongoing outbreak also prevents us to determine the rate of enrollment that we can achieve. As such, in Table 2 we are displaying the sample size calculation for our primary outcome, for an alpha level of 0.05 and a power level of 0.8, under different scenario. We will perform a first analysis based on 240 patients, evaluating the actual incidence of the primary outcome, effect of the treatment and the actual rate of enrollment. The PI will decide, together with the DSMB, whether to continue enrollment to 340 patients, if a sufficient rate of enrollment and power had not been achieved with the original sample size. Based on results reported in Table 2 , the same step could then be repeated increasing sample size from 340 to 500 patients, from 500 patients to 760 and from 760 patients to 1260..

For the t-test the normality distribution will be evaluated.Time to event outcomes will be analyzed by estimating survival curves over treated and non-treated using the Kaplan-Meier method.A subgroup analysis will be performed with multiple linear regression, as well as logistic and cox regression models to adjust for age, pulmonary comorbidities and coadministration of other experimental treatment.Data monitoring Data will be monitored by the principal investigator (PI) in collaboration with an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).

Every violation will be reported to the DSMB. Peripheral centers will be provided with a data sheet providing safety rules and will be instructed to report every violation to the coordinating hospital. Before the beginning of the study, the DSMB will meet to decide safety rules and stopping guidelines.We will not perform any interim analysis, but the DSMB will be granted the authority to stop the trial at any point due to safety concerns.

"Abstract

We study an epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate, describing the saturated mass action as well as the psychological effect of certain serious diseases on the community. Firstly, the existence and local stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria are investigated. Then, we prove the occurrence of backward bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation and cusp type Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 3. Finally, numerical simulations, including one limit cycle, two limit cycles, unstable homoclinic loop and many other phase portraits are presented. These results show that the psychological effect of diseases and the behavior change of the susceptible individuals may affect the final spread level of an epidemic. doi: bioRxiv preprint then ∆ > 0 if and only if R 0 > R * , ∆ = 0 if and only if R 0 = R * and ∆ < 0 if and only if R 0 < R * .

","Introduction

In generic, the population, for an SIS model, is always separated into two compartments, susceptible and infective individuals. And, in most SIS epidemic models (see Anderson and May [2] ), the incidence takes the mass-action form with bilinear interactions. However, in practical, to describe the transmission process more realistic, it is necessary to introduce the nonlinear contact rates [1] .Actually, various forms of nonlinear incidence rates have been proposed recently. For example, in order to incorporate the effect of behavioral changes, Liu, Levin, and Iwasa [3] used a nonlinear incidence rate of the formwhere κI ι represents the force of infection of the disease, 1/(1 + αI h ) is a description of the suppression effect from the behavioral change of susceptible individuals when the infective population increases. ι, h and κ are all positive constants, and α is a nonnegative constant. See also Hethcote and van den Driessche [4] , Moghadas [5] and Alexander and Moghadas [6, 7] , etc.In [10] , Ruan discuss a specific infection force g 1 (I) = κI 1 + αI 2 , Graphs of different incidence rate functions. (a) Nonmonotone incidence g 1 (I) = κI 1+αI 2 (κ = α = 1). (b) Nonlinear incidence g 2 (I) = κI 2 1+αI 2 (κ = α = 1). (c) Nonlinear and nonmonotone incidence rate G(I) = aI 2 I 2 +c + bI I 2 +c (a = c = 1, b = 0.5).see Fig. 1 (a), which can describe the effects of psychology function caused by protection measures and intervention policies. Obviously, g 1 (I) is increasing with small I and decreasing with large I, that is, g 1 (I) is non-monotone. The function g 1 (I) can be used to interpret the psychological effect: for a very large number of infective individuals, the infection force may decrease as the number of infective individuals increases, since large number of infective may lead to the reducing of the number of contacts per unit time. For example, in 2003, epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had such psychological effects on the general public (see [11] ), and aggressive measures and policies had been taken, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, etc. And also [11] showed that either the number of infective individuals tends to zero as time evolves or the disease persists. Furthermore, Li, Zhao and Zhu (see [20] ) studied the following SIS model, which describes behavior change effect of susceptible individual when infectious population increases dS dt = Λ − d 0 S − g 2 (I)S + δI, dI dt = g 2 (I)S − (d 0 + d + δ)I,where g 2 (I) = αI 2 1 + β 0 I 2 , see Fig. 1 (b). By the qualitative and bifurcation analyses, they showed that the maximal multiplicity of weak focus is 2, and proved that the model can undergo a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2. These results illustrate that the behavior change of the susceptible individuals may affect the final spread level of an epidemic.Actually, both the effect of psychological and behavior affect of susceptible individuals have influence on the transmission of the disease. Thus, motivated by the above researches, we consider a nonlinear incidence rate of a SIS model as followswhere G(I) = aI 2 c + I 2 + bI c + I 2 , see Fig. 1 (c), which can describe the effect of psychology and behavior change of susceptible individuals. S(t) and I(t) represent the number of susceptible individuals and infected individuals at time t, respectively. Λ is the recruitment rate of population, d is the natural death, µ is the disease-induced death rate, and σ represents the recovered rate, a, b and c are all positive constants.The organization of this paper is as follows. First of all, we analyze the existence of equilibria and local stability of equilibria. Then, we study the existence of Hopf bifurcation around the positive equilibrium at the critical value under the conditions of R 0 < 1 and R 0 > 1. We also show that these positive equilibria can be weak focus for some parameter values and a cusp type of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 3. Finally, we give some brief conclusion.

Types and Stability of equilibria

In this section, our aim is to perform an elaborative analysis of equilibria for system (2) .Firstly, for convenience, we make scalings:To avoid the abuse of mathematical notation, we still denote (Λ , a , d , σ , c , τ ) by (Λ, a, d, σ, c, t). Then model (2) becomeswith d + σ < 1.Proof Summing up the two equations in (3), we can getThus, lim sup t→∞ (x + y) ≤ Λ d , which implies the conclusion. Obviously, system (3) always has a unique disease-free equilibrium E 0 = ( Λ d , 0). The positive equilibria of (3) can be gained by solving the following algebraic equations Λ − xy(ay + 1) y 2 + c − dx + σy = 0, xy(ay + 1)Denote the basic reproduction number as follows,Computing the discriminant of (4), we getFurthermore, define,always has a disease-free equilibrium E 0 and the following conclusions hold.(i) When R 0 < 1, we have (a) if R 0 < R * , then system (3) has no positive equilibrium; (b) if R 0 = R * and Λ > (1 − σ)/a, then system (3) has a unique positive equilibrium In the following, we discuss the local stability of E k (x k , y k ) (k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and present the corresponding phase portrait. By directly calculating, the Jacobian matrix at equilibrium E k isWe haveIn addition, after some complicated computations, we get.Proof Obviously, at equilibrium E 0 , we have det(J 0 ) = d(1 − R 0 ) and Tr(J 0 ) = −d − (1 − R 0 ). Therefore, E 0 is a stable node if R 0 < 1 and a hyperbolic saddle if R 0 > 1, and degenerate if R 0 = 1.Indeed, if R 0 = 1, the Jacobian J 0 is diagonalizable with eigenvalues λ 1 = −d and λ 2 = 0 and respective eigenvectors ν 1 = (1, 0) and ν 2 = (− 1−σ d , 1). By the transformation usystem (5) can be rewritten asIf 2a − 1−σ dc = 0, according to the calculation of center manifold [15] , we know that the center manifold x = h(y) of (5) begins with quadratic term of y. In addition, from the second equation of (5), we can easily obtain that the equation restricted to the center manifold as followsBy applying the Theorem 7.1 in Zhang et al. [15] , E 0 is a saddle-node. If 2a − 1−σ dc = 0, then the center manifold turns into dy dt = 1 c y 3 + O(y 4 ).Since 1 c > 0 and the first nonzero item is uneven. Thus, the equilibrium E 0 is a repelling node, according to Theorem 7.1 in Zhang et al. [15] . Theorem 4 Suppose that R * < R 0 < 1 and aΛ > 1 − σ, then system (3) has two positive equilibria E 2 and E 3 , and equilibrium E 2 is a hyperbolic saddle for all permissible choices of parameters, equilibrium E 3 is not degenerate. Moreover,Proof Note that φ 2 is less than zero since ∆ < (aΛ + 1 − σ) 2 , then E 2 is a hyperbolic saddle for any choices of parameters. And at E 3 , we have φ 3 > 0. Thus, the stability of equilibrium E 3 depends on the sign of ψ 3 .Theorem 5 When R 0 = 1 and c > 1−σ a , then system (3) has a unique positive equilibrium E 4 (x 4 , y 4 ), and the equilibrium E 4 is stable if ψ 4 < 0.Proof In fact, when R 0 = 1 and c > 1−σ a , then φ 4 > 0. Thus, the stability of E 4 is determined by the sign of ψ 4 .The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/331678 doi: bioRxiv preprint Theorem 6 Assume R 0 > 1, then system (3) has a unique positive equilibrium E 5 . Moreover,Proof Obviously, when R 0 > 1, then φ 5 > 0, and then E 5 is stable if ψ 5 < 0.When ψ i = 0 (i = 3, 5), the dynamics of system (3) can be easily seen in Fig. 2 , Fig.  3 and Fig. 4 , respectively. The dynamical behaviors of system (3) when ψ i = 0 (i = 3, 5) will be discussed in detail in the next section. Remark 1 In fact, Fig. 2 (a) shows the occurrence of bi-stability, in which solution may converge to one of the two equilibria, depending on the initial conditions. And in practical, this interesting phenomenon implies that initial states determine whether the disease can dies out or not.Remark 2 From Fig. 2 (a), we can see there exists two seperatrices. All solutions tend to the disease-free equilibrium E 0 except the two green lines tend to equilibrium E 2 .Theorem 7 Suppose that R 0 = 1 and Λ > 1−σ a , then system (3) has a unique positive equilibrium E 4 . If ψ 4 > 0, then there exists at least one stable limit cycle in the interior of the first quadrant.Proof Indeed, the Jacobian J 0 is diagonalizable with eigenvalues λ 1 = −d and λ 2 = 0 and respective eigenvectors ν 1 = (1, 0) and ν 2 = (− 1−σ d , 1). By the transformation system (5) becomesThe theorem of Chochitaichvili [21] yields directly that system (6) is topologically equivalent to the system:It is easy to see that 2a − 1−σ dc > 0 according to the condition of R 0 = 1 and Λ > 1−σ a , and then we can gain that there exist a unique repelling equilibrium E 4 in the region D 1 shown in (a) of Fig.5 . Consequently, by the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem, at least one stable limit cycle appears in the interior of the first quadrant. Similarly, when ψ 5 > 0, we have the following result.Theorem 8 Suppose that R 0 > 1. If ψ 5 > 0, then there exists at least one stable limit cycle in the interior of the first quadrant.Proof Indeed, the Jacobian J 5 has eigenvalues λ 1 = −d and λ 2 = R 0 − 1 > 0, when R 0 > 1. Thus, we can gain that there exist a E 5 , which is the unique repelling equilibrium in the region D 2 shown in (b) of Fig.5 . Consequently, by the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem, at least one stable limit cycle appears in the interior of the first quadrant.a and ψ 4 > 0, there exists a stable limit cycle. (b): When R 0 > 1 and ψ 5 > 0, there exists a stable limit cycle. Fig. 3 , we can see clearly that there exist a stable limit cycle enclosing the equilibrium E 5 even though E 0 is a saddle-node. Similarly, from (b) of Fig. 4 , we can also gain that there exists a stable limit cycle if E 4 is unstable.

Bifurcations Backward bifurcation

Remark 4 When R 0 = 1 and Λ > 1−σ a , system (3) exhibits a unique positive equilibrium E 4 , which means that once R 0 crosses 1, the disease can invade to a relatively high level. And this is one of the main characters of backward bifurcation [19] .Remark 5 Actually, backward bifurcation did not emerge with a = 0, which is considered in [20] . This indicates that introducing the non-motonic incidence into model (1) makes the epidemic model more complex and exhibit richer dynamical behaviors.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Hopf bifurcation

In this subsection, we will study the Hopf bifurcation of system (3) for (i) R * < R 0 < 1 and Λ > (1 − σ)/a; (ii) R 0 > 1. From the discussion in Section 2, it can be seen that Hopf bifurcation may occur at E 3 , E 5 . As the expressions of equilibria E 3 and E 5 are same, no considering the values of every parameters. Based on Theorem 4, Theorem 5 and Theorem 6, we know that the stability of E 3 and E 5 are similar and when ψ k = 0, E k (k = 3, 5) is a weak focus or center. Thus, we show the existence of Hopf bifurcation around E k (k = 3, 5).Theorem 10 Suppose E k (k = 3, 5) exist, then model (2) undergoes a Hopf bifurcation at equilibrium E k if ψ k = 0. Moreover, (a) if η < 0, there is a family of stable periodic orbits of model (3) as ψ k decreases from 0;(b) if η = 0, there are at least two limit cycles in (3), where η will be defined below; (c) if η > 0, there is a family of unstable periodic orbits of (3) as ψ k increases from 0.Proof From the above discussions, we can see that trJ k = 0 if and only if ψ k = 0, and det J k > 0 when equilibrium E k exists. Therefore, the eigenvalues of J k are a pair of pure imaginary roots if ψ k = 0. From direct calculations we have thatBy Theorem 3.4.2 in [16] , Ψ k = 0 is the Hopf bifurcation point for (3). Next, introduce a new time variable τ by dt = (y 2 + c)dτ . By rewriting τ as t, we obtain the following equivalent system of (3)dy dt = xy(ay + 1) − y(y 2 + c).Let X = x − x k and Y = y − y k , still use (x, y) to express (X, Y ), then system (7) becomesLetÊ denote the origin of x − y plane. Since E k satisfies Eq. (3), we obtainand it is easy to verify that b 11 + b 22 = 0 if and only if ψ k = 0. Let ω = (det J(Ê)) 1 2 , u = −x and v = b11 ω x + b12 ω y, then the normal form of system (7) reads where f uv denotes ∂ 2 f ∂u∂v (0, 0), etc. Then, by computing we obtainBy Theorem 3.4.2 and Theorem 3.4.11 in [16] , the rest claims in Theorem 10 are true.Remark 6 What need to be noted here is that the expression b 12 in Theorem 10 is nonzero. Otherwise, we have det J k = b 11 b 22 < 0, since b 11 + b 22 = 0, which is an contradiction.Next, we present examples to show that equilibrium E k can be a stable weak focus of multiplicity two, and under a small perturbation, system (3) undergoes a degenerate Hopf bifurcation and produces two limit cycles.Firstly, fix y k = 1/2 and solve for a = −2 + 6 (2−2Λ−σ) . Also, fix x k = 1, based on a = −2 + 6 (2−2Λ−σ) , we can get d = . Secondly, substitute these expressions into η and through complicated computation, we can obtain η L 1 = 81(1+2Λ+σ) 2 64(1−2Λ+σ) 6 (32Λ 5 − 80Λ 4 (−1 +σ) + 8Λ 3 (−39 + 2σ(−13 + 5σ)) +4Λ 2 (−103 +σ(99 + 2(24 − 5σ)σ)) +σ(140 −σ(139 +σ(−21 +(−11 +σ)σ))) + 2Λ(−80 +σ(242 +σ(−81 +σ(−38 + 5σ))))), withσ = 1 − σ > 0, which is the first Liapunov number of the equilibrium (0, 0) of (8). Then, we fixσ = 4/5 and solve equation η = 0, then we get only one suitable value 0.5859 for Λ. That is to say, if (σ, Λ, d, a, c) = (1/5, 5859, 0.2, 8, 4.741), then L 1 = 0. Furthermore, it can be seen that E k = E 3 under this group of parameters. In the following, we further compute the second Liapunov number of the equilibrium (0, 0) of system (8) by the successor function method. It is convenient to introduce polar coordinates (r, θ) and rewrite system (8) in polar coordinates by x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ. It is clear that in a small neighborhood of the origin, the successor function D(c 0 ) of system (8) can be expressed bywhere r(θ, c 0 ) is the solution of the following Cauchy problem dr dθ = R 2 (θ)r 2 + R 3 (θ)r 3 + R 4 (θ)r 4 + R 5 (θ)r 5 + . . . ,where R i (θ) (i = 1, 2, 3 . . .) is a polynomial of (sin θ, cos θ), whose coefficient can be expressed by the coefficients of system (8) . We omit them here, since the expressions are too long.With the aid of Mathematica, we get Besides, we give the numerical simulation graphs for one limit cycle and two limit cycles under small perturbations of some parameters. From Fig. 6 (a) , we can see that there exist only one limit cycle around the endemic E 3 , and Fig. 6 (b) emphasizing that if we change the values of parameters Λ and c, an unstable homoclinic loop arise, which is shown in Fig.7 .Around equilibrium E 5 , we can gain the same result from Fig. 8 . Under the condition that parameter a, d, σ take value 5.6923, 0.11, 0.2 and change value of Λ and c from 0.45102, 3.6062 to 0.51, 3.5972, respectively, which is a minor change, then the number of limit cycles will add one. Thus, the interior equilibrium E 5 is a stable weak focus of multiplicity two if (σ, Λ, d, a, c) = (0.2, 0.51, 0.11, 5.6923, 3.5962).

Remark 7

As a matter of fact, the reproduction number is equal to zero in [8, 20] , which simplifies the condition that Hopf bifurcation occur. In our model, we also comprehensively discuss the existence of Hopf bifurcation when R 0 < 1, R 0 = 1 and R 0 > 1. Besides, authors in [20] did not show the appearance of homoclinic loop, which is an interesting bifurcation phenomenon given in Fig.7 

Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation

In this subsection, we investigate the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation in system (3). The following Lemma 3 is from Perko [17] , and Lemma 4 is Proposition 5.3 in Lamontage et al. [18] .is equivalent to the systemin some small neighborhood of (0, 0) after changes of coordinates.

Lemma 4 The system

is equivalent to the systemin some small neighborhood of (0, 0) after changes of coordinates.From Theorem 1, we can see that there exists a unique positive equilibrium E 1 (x 1 , y 1 ) when R 0 = R * , where (1 − σ) ) .From the proving process of Theorem 4, it is easily to know that detJ 1 = 0. And Theorem 3 suggests that the characteristic matrix J 1 possesses a zero eigenvalue with multiplicity 2 when ψ 1 = 0, which shows that system (3) may admit a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Thus, we can prove the following theorem.Define two functions:Theorem 11 Suppose that R 0 = R * and ψ 1 = 0, then the only interior equilibrium E 1 of system (3) is a cusp. Moreover, (a) if f (y 1 )g(y 1 ) = 0, then E 1 is a cusp of codimension 2;(b) if f (y 1 )g(y 1 ) = 0, then E 1 is a cusp of codimension greater than or equal to 3.Proof Changing the variables as X = x − x 1 , Y = y − y 1 , system (3) becomeswhereMake the non-singular linear transformation1 0x y .Then system (9) is transformed intowhere Q 2 (x, y) is a smooth function in (x, y) at least of the third order andBy Lemma 3, we obtain an topologically equivalent system of system (10)where b 3 = df (y 1 ) (c + y 2 1 ) 3 , b 4 + 2b 1 = − g(y 1 ) y 1 (ay 1 + 1)(y 2 1 + c) 2 . Therefore, E 1 is a cusp of codimension 2 if f (y 1 )g(y 1 ) = 0, by the results in Perko [17] , or else, E 1 is a cusp of codimension at least 3.

Remark 8

In fact, Theorem 11 (b) include the following three cases:(1) if f (y 1 ) = 0 and g(y 1 ) = 0, E 1 is a cusp point;(2) if f (y 1 ) = 0 and g(y 1 ) = 0, E 1 is nilpotent focus/elliptic point;(3) if f (y 1 ) = g(y 1 ) = 0, E 1 is a nilpotent focus.Unfortunately, because of the complexity of f (y 1 ) and g(y 1 ), we can not determine which of these three situations can occur theoretically. But we will show for some parameter values, f (y 1 ) = 0 and g(y 1 ) = 0, i.e. E 1 is a cusp point.In the following, we will give an example to show that the case (b) of Theorem 11 occur.In the first place, fix y 1 = 1/5, then from y 1 = aΛ−(1−σ) 2(d+a(1−σ)) , we can solve for σ = 1 − −2d+5aΛ 5+2a . By assumptions ψ 1 = 0 and R 0 = R * , then fromwe can get d and Λ, where.for any a, c > 0. We solve g(y 1 ) = 0 for parameter c denoted by c g ± , where 531415+a(104449+4a(318+a) ))))) 50a(15+2a). Theorem 12 When (a, d, c, Λ, σ) = (a 0 , d 0 , c 0 , Λ 0 , σ 0 ), then E 1 is a Bogdanov-Takens point of codimension 3, and the system (3) localized at E 1 is topologically equivalent towhere G < 0.Proof First of all, applying a linear transformation T 1 : (x, y) → (u, v), defined by u = x − x 1 , v = y − y 1 , we can reduce system (3) further to the formwhere , q 04 = x1(ac 3 −10ac 2 y 2 1 +5acy 4 1 −5c 2 y1+10cy 3 1 −y 5 1 ) (c+y 2 1 ) 5Another transformation T 2 : (u, v) → (x, y), defined by x = v, y = q 10 u − p 10 v, reduces system (11) towhere a 11 = q11 q10 , a 20 = q 02 + p10q11 q10 , a 21 = q12 q10 , a 30 = q03q10+p10q12 q10 , a 40 = q 04 , b 11 = p 11 − p10q11 q10 , b 20 = p 10 p 11 − p 10 q 02 + p 02 q 10 − and other coefficients are equal to zero. Then using the near-identity transformation T 3 : (x, y) → (u, v), defined by u = x + 1 2 (a 11 + b 02 )x 2 − a 02 xy, v = y + a 20 x 2 − b 20 xy, and parameters (a 0 , d 0 , c 0 , Λ 0 , σ 0 ) make b 11 + 2a 20 = 0, so we obtain We perform a near-identity smooth change of coordinates The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/331678 doi: bioRxiv preprint Remark 9 Authors in [8, 20] proved their epidemic model with saturated incidence rate, undergo a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2. When we consider the incidence of a combination of the saturated incidence rate and a non-monotonic incidence, the codimension of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation can be up to 3.

Remark 10

Xiao and Ruan (see [10] ) showed that either the number of infective individuals tends to zero as time evolves or the disease persists. Authors in [8, 20] proved that their epidemic model with saturated incidence rate, undergo a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2. When we consider the incidence of a combination of the saturated incidence rate and a non-monotonic incidence, the codimension of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation can be up to 3.

Conclusions

In this paper, by combing qualitative and bifurcation analyses, we study an SIS epidemic model with the incidence rate aI 2 c+I 2 + bI c+I 2 , which can describe the inhibition effect from the behavioral change and interpret the ""psychological"" effect. In Section 2, we give a full-scale analysis for the types and stability of equilibria E i (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We prove that system (2) can occur backward bifurcation and the backward bifurcation will disappear if a = 0. At equilibrium E i (i = 3, 5), degenerate Hopf bifurcation arises under certain conditions. When the critical condition Ψ i (i = 3, 5) satisfied, we calculate the Liapunov value of the weak focus and obtain the value 2 for the maximal multiplicity of weak focus, indicating that there exist at most two limit cycles around E i (i = 3, 5). In Fig. 6, and Fig. 8 , we give the phase portrait corresponding to equilibrium E 3 and E 5 about exhibiting a unique limit cycle and adding a new limit cycle after small perturbation of parameter Λ and c. In Subsection 3.3, we proved that the model exhibits Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2 and codimension 3, under certain conditions. If parameter a = 0, the model can just have Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2, shown in [20] .In fact, we show that the model exhibits multi-stable states. This interesting phenomenon indicates that the initial states of an epidemic can determine the final states of an epidemic to extinct or not. Moreover, the periodical oscillation signify that the trend of the disease may be affected by the behavior of susceptible and the effect of psychology of the disease.

"Abstract

Any plan for stopping the ongoing 2019-nCov epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by onetime vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients within 24 hours of symptom onset (assuming 10% asymptomatic transmission). The epidemic could be ended in six months if testing with isolation and treatment reached 90% of symptomatic patients. If 90% of symptomatic patients could be tested within six hours of symptoms appearing, the epidemic could be ended in under four months.

Any plan for stopping the ongoing 2019-nCov epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end.Ending the epidemic requires reducing the basic reproduction number (R) -the average number of people infected by each 2019-nCov-infected patient -to below 1, at which point transmission contracts and eventually burns out. However, if R is only brought marginally below 1, transmission could still linger for years. Enough infections could occur during this time that, especially given high mobility of people and density of urban areas, new hotspots could get seeded and transmission could resurge above 1. Ending the epidemic, therefore, may require not just getting R below 1, but driving it down more aggressively in order to reach zero cases quickly.In January, the mean R was estimated at 2.2 (3.9, upper bound of 95% confidence interval), with each infection on average resulting in two or more infections [1]. Although cases of asymptomatic transmission have been documented [2,3], the World Health Organization advises that transmission is still primarily driven by symptomatic patients [4] .In order to bring R below 1, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by one-time vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. We employed an SEIR-type transmission model [5] where the mean incubation period is 5 days, mean infectious period is 7 days, and the initial prevalence of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) infections is at 0.1% in a population of 10 million, roughly the population of Wuhan. In light of the unknowns with asymptomatic transmission, a fixed percentage of the transmission is modeled prior to symptom onset.If the current R is 2.2 or 3.9, 55% or 74% of the at-risk population, respectively, would need to be vaccinated in order to bring R below 1. If R is 2.2 and 10% of transmission occurs asymptomatically, approximately 60%, 68%, or 82% of symptomatic individuals would need to be tested and isolated for treatment within six, 24, or 48 hours, respectively, of symptom onset in order to bring R below 1. If asymptomatic transmission accounted for 20% of overall transmission, coverage would need to reach 65%, 74%, and 87% of the symptomatic individuals, respectively. If R is 3.9 and 10% of transmission occurs asymptomatically, testing with isolation and treatment would need to reach 83% or 93% of symptomatic individuals if done within six or 24 hours of symptom onset, respectively. Given that the denominator for population-wide vaccination (~10 million) is much greater than the proportion of that population with concerning symptoms, far fewer people would need to be reached with testing and isolation for treatment than for vaccinating to achieve herd immunity.We then modeled the number of days it would take to get to zero with different rates of coverage with vaccination or testing with isolation and treatment of symptomatically infected patients ( Figure 1 ). If R is currently 2.2, for example, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination.

Basic reproduction number, R0

The basic reproduction number is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by primary infectious individuals during the early transmission phase in a completely susceptible population[1]. This a key metric to gauge the intensity and type of interventions that need to be implemented in order to bring the epidemic under control. For the ongoing epidemic of 2019-nCov, R0 has been estimated at 2.2 (3.9, upper bound of 95% confidence interval).

Modeling the effect of testing and treatment/isolation of individuals

We employed an SEIR-type transmission model to evaluate the effects of the percentage of symptomatic individuals that are tested/screened as well as the average time that it takes to bring them into isolation and treatment [2] . The population is classified into 5 epidemiological states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic and infectious individuals that are tested (Is), symptomatic infectious individuals that are not tested and remain in the community (In), symptomatic individuals that are effectively isolated and treated (J), and recovered individuals (R).

Susceptible individuals may be infected by contacting symptomatic and infectious individuals (Is+ In) and partially infectious individuals incubating the disease (E). The force of infection is

Where b is the transmission rate and q is a parameter ranging from 0 to 1 that models the relative infectiousness of individuals during the incubation period of the disease.Exposed individuals progress to the symptomatic phase after an average of 5 days whereas the average infectious period for symptomatic individuals is 7 days. The percentage of the symptomatic individuals that undergo testing (Is) ranges from 0 to 100%. The average time from onset of symptoms to isolation and treatment for individuals that undergo testing ranges from 6 to 48 hours.The reproduction number that includes the effects of testing and isolation and treatment of symptomatic individuals is given by:In the absence of testing, the basic reproduction number (R0) is simply given by R0= b(q/k+ 1/g)

Modeling the time to get to zero

We modeled the average number of days it would take to get to zero cases once the reproduction number declines below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 for various control interventions. For this purpose, we generated stochastic simulations [3] using the compartmental model described in the previous section assuming that the initial prevalence of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) infections is at 0.1% in a population of 10 million. To calculate the average number of days to get to zero cases, we simulated a total of 200 stochastic epidemics..

"Abstract

We present a self-synchronizing and robust method for comparing the progression of the Covid-19 epidemics among multiple countries. In their growth phase the epidemics show power law rather than exponential law time dependences. They are similar enough for the earlier China outbreak to guide other countries projections. The delayed reaction of European countries is shown to produce a significantly worse outcome compared to China.

","Introduction

As the Covid-19 disease is currently spreading across many countries around the world, it is of crucial importance for public authorities to be able to easily estimate the dynamics of the epidemic, the expected effects of restrictions imposed on the population, and the impact of delays in their application.China suffered from the epidemic outbreak earlier than the rest of the world and imposed immediate and stringent confinement measures as a reaction. The positive effects of the Chinese measures have become evident in the past few weeks, and the Chinese data can thus be used as a reference to better analyze the situation in other countries. A variety of approaches may be used. One example consists in collecting data on various cities in a given country and comparing them to a set of historical data collected in a series of cities judged relevant in China. Coupled with epidemic spreading modeling, this procedure may help extrapolate the trends to be expected in the cities under study, and to deduce forecasts for the entire country. Unfortunately, as the European cities under consideration are still in a very early stage of the epidemic's development, this approach is very imprecise and the extrapolations obtained may be of weak reliability. For instance, one such study released on March 8, 2020 predicted that the final total number of diagnosed confirmed cases in Italy after the end of the epidemic would reach approximately 7,000 +/-1,000 [1] . Today we know that this number was significantly underestimated, as four days later the official records exceeded 15,000 confirmed cases. This shows the need of a simpler but more robust method in order to guide authorities.In this short note, we suggest a simple way of visualizing the epidemic trajectories of select countries to enable an easy and direct comparison with China. It immediately appears that several European countries have followed rather closely China's trajectory up until now.Order of magnitude estimates of what may be expected for the weeks to come can thus be provided. The estimates provided below highlight the importance of rapid authority response time. Simply stated: in the race against the clock, any delays in authority reaction will allow for the further spread of the epidemic.

Method and analysis

In figure 1, rather than time series, we plot for each day the number of daily new confirmed cases as a function of N, the total number of confirmed cases since the onset of the epidemic, for several countries [2, 3] . This is equivalent to phase space plots commonly used to represent dynamical systems in Physics. While each dot represents the data from a given day, time does not explicitly appear. Such a plot enables a direct comparison of the otherwise nonsynchronous curves of the disease progression for the different countries.A further feature of this plot is that it is largely independent of the case detection methods which are known to vary both from country to country as well as over time for a given country. When a specific country decides to change its detection strategy, a perturbation appears transiently on the curve and then is rapidly dampened in the following days. In other words, the plot outlines possible measurement inconsistencies and at the same time provides the underlying trend of the epidemic for a given country. A detailed analysis of these benefits is given in Appendix 1.As data span several orders of magnitude, logarithmic scales are used. It is clearly visible that within individual variations and data collection rule modifications, the China trajectory is tracked rather closely by the other countries. Figure 1 : Number of new daily confirmed cases as a function of N, which is the total number of confirmed cases since onset of Covid-19 epidemic for China, Italy, France, Germany and Spain. Each point corresponds to a specific day. All of the countries exhibit similar epidemic progression within a certain band. Projection for Italy (dotted line and blue points) takes into account a 13-day delay beyond lockdown to reach the maximum daily confirmed cases as observed in China. The sharp peak on China's curve is due to a change of counting method on Fed 12 and is discussed in Appendix 1.A key observation is that the maximum of the daily confirmed cases in China occurred some 13 days after a stringent lockdown was put into place in Wuhan and its region. This 13-day delay is similar to the one separating the onset of symptoms from the time of diagnosis, as found in interviews of patients [4] . Beyond the maximum, it is worthwhile noting that the China curve falls off as the number of daily new cases starts to decrease. The number of confirmed cases continues to increase; nevertheless at a slower pace, and finally stabilizes at a significantly higher value than what was recorded at the maximum. At this stage, the number of daily cases has become very small and the virus propagation is essentially halted.A comparison of plots in Figure 1 shows that the Italian lockdown versus the Chinese lockdown was ordered approximately 10 days later in the epidemic progression. One may readily try to estimate the final number of cases to be expected by assuming that the Italian lockdown will have the same effects as the Chinese lockdown. The ascending part of the Italian curve can be approximated by a straight line with a slope α = 0.817 in logarithmic scale. As shown in Appendix 1 this corresponds to the following time dependence for the total number of confirmed cases since epidemic onset N(t):where N(t) is the number of confirmed cases as a function of time expressed in days starting on February 23, 2020 with N 0 = 157 confirmed cases. The dynamics is thus described by a power law, rather than by an exponential law. Assuming this progression regime remains the same across the entire ascending part of the curve, the maximum number of confirmed cases for Italy is estimated to reach around 55,000. Assuming further the efficiency of the Italian lockdown to be similar to that of China, we then add a downward slope matching the Chinese one. This triggers an additional number of cases equal to 1.7 times the number of cases at the maximum, yielding a final number reaching approximately 140,000 confirmed cases for Italy.A precise estimation of the final death toll that can be expected is outside the scope of this note. Calculating this would require knowledge of the actual mortality rate; e.g. the final number of deaths relative to the final number of infections. If symptomatic cases are the only ones counted, then the number of infection cases are underestimated, and the apparent mortality rate is computed to be higher than it actually is. During the epidemic progression this apparent mortality rate may change over time. Since the epidemic onset in Italy for instance, as of March 15 a steady increase in the apparent mortality rate can be observed. This may be due to a combination of causes: a decrease in the efficiency of case detection as the number of infections grows, a concomitant decrease in medical care efficiency, and effects linked to the time-lag between the detection of early symptoms and actual death [5] . If one uses the WHO's average mortality rate estimate of 3.4% then Italy's final death toll would rise to approximately 5,000. However with the significantly higher apparent mortality rate of 8.3% observed on March 18, 2020 [2] and its still increasing trend, more than 10.000 deaths may be expected. This range of numbers should be compared to the approximately 3,300 deaths in China.In the case of France, school and University closure decisions were announced on March 12, 2020 by president Emmanuel Macron, with strict confinement measures effective March 17, 2020, which is close to the same point in epidemic progression as when Italy applied full lockdown on March 9, 2020. The French case may lead towards an outcome in number of cases of the same magnitude as Italy's, with a smaller final death toll as the observed apparent mortality is smaller as of March 18. It currently appears that the France is moving in a direction comparable to Italy's in terms of the death toll, with France nevertheless appearing to have a lower mortality rate as of March 18, 2020.Our approach thus provides guideline estimates based on the currently available data. It demonstrates how sharply the confirmed cases and the corresponding death toll will increase, as both France and Italy waited longer than China before taking lockdown actions. For Italy alone, the 10-day lag compared to China may engender approximately three times more deaths. In addition, Germany and Spain appear to be at a similar stage in epidemic progression, indicating that the total death toll in Europe will far exceed China's death toll.It should be stated that the data coming from China was made available early to European authorities, and thus allowed for more time to prepare an informed and coordinated response to the coming outbreak. The earlier lockdown in China appears to have significantly limited the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic there. The time lost in European countries to initiate a similar level of action may unfortunately result in a death toll increased by the thousands relative to the China outbreak.

Conclusion

We have introduced a ""phase space plot"" of the covid-19 epidemic progression where, instead of time series, the number of daily new cases is plotted as a function of the total number of confirmed cases since epidemic onset. This representation makes clear that the countries considered, within fluctuations, follow very similar epidemic trajectories. It allows an easy extraction of the mathematical law governing the expansion phase and, using the China data as a guiding example, suggests a way to estimate the final outcome of lockdown timing and its strength.The evolution of the characteristic time for doubling the daily confirmed cases is often used to measure the speed of epidemic progression. If the epidemic dynamics law was exponential one would expect the doubling time to be constant in time. In the countries considered here the epidemic progression is not exponential but of power law type, which implies an in-built gradual increase of the doubling time. Therefore this increase does not prove by itself that sanitary measures are being effective. Such a conclusion can only be reached when a change of dynamical regime occurs, showing a persistent deviation from the trend such as shown in Fig.1 or from the law given by eq. (1) for Italy and eq. (3) of appendix 1 for other countries (with appropriately determined values of α).In this short note we have only exemplified a few European countries and mainly focused on Italy as an example, but our approach may be applied to other countries as well. We hope that visual representations like the one we present in this note can help better anticipate the Covid-19 epidemic dynamics and provide a crucial tool for public officials' decision making. Now assume that a country suddenly changes its counting method, resulting in K changing to K new : the corresponding points on the country curve will be shifted vertically. But as new cases counted with K new accumulate, they will outnumber the previous points and the curve will revert to the underlying trend (within a gradually smaller vertical shift) and to its associated slope. An example is seen in China's curve in Fig. 1 . The sharp peak corresponds to the country's decision of February 12 to extend counting to ""clinically diagnosed cases"" (e.g. using CT scans), a decision that suddenly increased the numbers and provoked some confusion. It only alters our plot locally.Finally it can be checked that if the efficiency of case counting gradually decreases with time for a country, which may be the case as suggested by the increase of apparent mortality observed in several countries (see main text), curves in Fig. 1 are only slightly altered.

"Abstract

We assess the impact of asymptomatic transmission on epidemic potential of novel respiratory pathogens (like COVID-19) -as measured both by the basic reproduction number (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R 0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R 0 will be underestimated. We also show that as the length of asymptomatic generation intervals increase, estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase of the epidemic decrease. Our analysis provides a rationale for assessing the duration of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in addition to their prevalence in the population.

","I. INTRODUCTION

In an epidemic, symptomatic cases are the predominant focus of treatment and usually represent the bulk of reported cases. However, infected individuals who are asymptomatic yet infectious can be a critical factor in the spread of some pathogens [1] . Asymptomatic individuals are hard to trace, unlikely to self-isolate, and are likely to retain normal social and travel patterns.There is significant ongoing interest in asymptomatic infections in COVID-19 for two major reasons. First, the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic (see [2] ) is critical to attempts to estimate the likely burden of severe outcomes (including mortality [3] ) when the virus spreads through a population. Second, understanding the possible role of transmission by asymptomatic individuals is crucial to planning surveillance and control efforts [1, 4] .Here, we focus on a third effect. If asymptomatic cases are important for transmission, they also have the potential to affect estimates of key parameters of disease spread such as the basic reproduction number R 0 (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population [5] ). Thus, we investigate the relationship between individual-level features of asymptomatic cases (e.g., the probability that an infection is asymptomatic, asymptomatic case duration, transmission by asymptomatic individuals) to dynamics at the population scale.

II. METHODS

We model viral spread using a renewal-equation framework [6] , which allows us to model the current incidence of infected individuals (i.e., the rate at which new infections occur in the population) as a function of previous incidence and how infectiousness of an infected individual varies over the course of their infection. We divide incidence i into two categories -i a and i s -corresponding to incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. Newly infected individuals that are either asymptomatically or symptomatically infected can transmit the disease to others, but they differ in their intrinsic reproduction numbers, R a and R s , respectively, as well as intrinsic generation-interval distributions [7] , g a (τ ) and g s (τ ). Generation intervals, which are defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person [8] , depend on the natural history of infection: individuals with subclinical infections may have fast clearance and short generation intervals, or slow viral reproduction and long generation intervals (cf. [9] ). The shape of the generation-interval distribution characterizes the relationship between the epidemic growth rate r and the reproduction number [10] .Neglecting births and loss of immunity on the time scale of the outbreak, the dynamics of susceptibles and incidence are:The basic reproduction number of this system is:where p is the proportion of incident cases that are asymptomatic: i a (t) = pi(t). The corresponding intrinsic generation-interval distribution of an average infected individual is given by:where we define the ""intrinsic"" proportion of asymptomatic transmission z as the relative contribution of asymptomatic cases to the basic reproduction number:Note that the intrinsic proportion of symptomatic transmission satisfiesYet, this information is not sufficient to disentangle the role of asymptomatic cases, i.e., what fraction of secondary cases can be ascribed to realized transmission from asymptomatic cases vs. symptomatic cases?The intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z is a useful benchmark, but does not necessarily reflect the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission, unless both .

The realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission, q at time t is given by:During the period of exponential growth, we assume S remains nearly constant, and i(t) isproportional to exp(rt), and simplify by recalling that i a (t) = pi(t), i s (t) = (1 − p)i(t) such that:Here, δ c for each of the two classes is the average ""discount"" of a new infection -the average relative contribution of a secondary infection to the epidemic, taking exponential growth into account:δ c < 1 and grows smaller as the generation interval grows longer. Thus, the realized proportion of asymptomatic infections will be increased (resp., decreased) if transmission is relatively faster (slower) along the asymptomatic route. The discount δ also depends on the relative variation in the generation-interval distribution, the ""dispersion"": more variation in generation intervals leads to more opportunities for fast spread and thus to higher values of δ (similar to shorter average generation intervals).To estimate the effects of assumptions about asymptomatic transmission on the importance of asymptomatic transmission and estimates of the basic reproduction number R 0 , we parameterize the generation interval distributions of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases based on their means,Ḡ a andḠ s , and dispersions, κ a and κ s . We assume that generation intervals are gamma distributed, and we set the dispersion to be equal to the squared coefficient of variation (the reciprocal of the gamma shape parameter, see Supplementary Materials). We assume that epidemic growth rate r and the generation-interval distribution of symptomatic case are known, using parameter values that are consistent with earlier COVID-19 models [11] : 1/r = 7 days,Ḡ s = 8 days, and κ s = 0.5. We infer values of q using Eq. (8) and R 0 using the Euler-Lotka equation [12] :In Supplementary Materials, we also use an ordinary differential equation model including .

III. RESULTS

We explore the effects of different assumptions about speed and effectiveness of asymptomatic transmission on the importance of asymptomatic transmission and estimates of the basic reproduction number R 0 , using a gamma assumption (see Methods). Across the range of parameters we explore, the intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z is similar to the realized proportion q ( Figure 1A ). As the relative mean generation interval of asymptomatic transmission,Ḡ a /Ḡ s , increases, q decreases because symptomatic cases are .

Figure 1B shows the effect of different assumptions about the generation interval of asymptomatic cases,Ḡ a , on the basic reproduction number R 0 . WhenḠ a is long compared toḠ s , then we are effectively assuming a longer mean for the overall generation interval.This assumption leads to a larger estimate of R 0 for a fixed value of r (see [13] ). Conversely, whenḠ a <Ḡ s , generation intervals are shorter, leading to lower estimates of the epidemic strength R 0 . Both of these effects are stronger when the intrinsic proportion of asymptomatic transmission z increases (and disappear as z → 0). Therefore, when R 0 is estimated without explicitly accounting for asymptomatic spread (white, dashed line in Figure 1B) , it can be over-or under-estimated depending on the relative duration of infection between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The qualitative effects of z andḠ a /Ḡ s on q and R 0 remain robust when we assume narrower (κ s = κ a = 0.3; Figure S1 ) or wider (κ s = κ a = 0.8; Figure S2 ) generation intervals.Relative generation-interval dispersion of asymptomatic cases κ a /κ s have similar, but smaller, effects on q and R 0 ( Figure S3 ). Since a wider generation-interval distribution has a higher proportion of early transmission than a narrow one, increasing the generationinterval dispersion has qualitatively similar effects on q and R 0 as decreasing the mean generation interval.

IV. DISCUSSION

Much is still unknown about the time scale and effectiveness of asymptomatic transmission in COVID-19. Here we highlight the need to characterize the generation-interval distribution for asymptomatic transmission, and its consequences not only for contact tracing but for estimation of the basic reproduction number of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak [11] and of the effective proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential-growth phase. Our reproductive number findings fit into a broader framework linking epidemic speed, strength, and generation intervals -for a given observed speed increases in the mean generation interval imply larger reproduction number [9, 10, [13] [14] [15] .If asymptomatic infections are more persistent than symptomatic ones, the mean generation interval for COVID-19 could be longer than estimated from symptomatic cases alone -.

However, if asymptomatic cases tend to resolve quickly, then current estimates of R 0 may be over-estimates of the underlying strength ( Figure 1B) , and asymptomatic cases may be driving a larger fraction of secondary cases than we would expect without accounting for their differences ( Figure 1A ). Note that cases do not have to be completely asymptomatic for our qualitative results to apply. People with mild symptoms unlikely to be diagnosed in a particular time and place (sometimes referred to as subclinical cases) are expected to affect transmission patterns in the same way.We focus here on the exponential phase, so it is worth noting that the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission q is time-dependent, varying with dynamic changes in incidence and proportion susceptible. Future work might also consider the ways in which asymptomatic individuals can modulate the catalysis of epidemics in a networked metapopulation [16] [17] [18] . Characterizing the role of asymptomatic individuals in driving the persistence of the epidemic will be critical for assessing the post-pandemic outcome [19] .Acknowledgments: The authors thank John Glasser for comments and discussion on the manuscript, particularly on short notice.

A gamma approximation to generation-interval distributions

Assuming that the intrinsic generation-interval distribution for each class (asymptomatic and symptomatic) follows a gamma distribution with meanḠ c and dispersion κ c , the average discount of a new infection can be written as:which shows that the average discount increases with smallerḠ c and with larger κ c . Then, the odds of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission can be written as:.

Finally, the basic reproduction number is calculated by using the Euler-Lotka equation:(S3)A compartmental model for asymptomatic/symptomatic cases Consider an SEIR model variant in which an infected individual can be either asymptomatic, I a , or symptomatic, I s . We note that I a and I s represent prevalence (i.e., the total number of currently infectious individuals) of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals; these quantities are different from i s and i s that we present in the main text, which represent incidence (i.e., the rate at which new cases are generated) of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. While both cases can recover, we assume that only symptomatic cases can lead to fatalities, denoted by the D category. In total, the dynamics of susceptibles, exposed, infectious, recovered, and dead are:Here, β a and β s denote transmission rates, γ e denotes the transition from exposed to infectious, p is the fraction of asymptomatic cases that are generated for each exposed individual, 1 − p is the fraction of symptomatic cases that are generated for each exposed individual, γ a and γ s denote recovery rates, and f denotes the case fatality ratio for symptomatic cases.Given that the number of infected individuals increase exponentially at rate r initially, the equations for the infectious cases can be rewritten given the ansatz E(t) = c e e rt , I a (t) = c a e rt , .

"Abstract

The virus receptor is key for viral infection of host cells. Identification of the virus receptor is still challenging at present. Our previous study has shown that human virus receptor proteins have some unique features including high level of N-glycosylation, high number of interaction partners and high expressions. Here, we built a random-forest model to identify human virus receptorome from human cell membrane proteins with accepted accuracy based on combination of unique features of human virus receptors and protein sequences. A total of 729 human cell membrane proteins were predicted to constitute the receptorome for the human-infecting virome.Combination of the random-forest model with protein-protein interactions between human and viruses predicted in previous studies further predicted

","Introduction

Receptor-binding is the first step for viral infection of host cells. Proteins are considered to be better receptors for viruses due to their higher binding affinity and specificity than carbohydrate and lipid (Baranowski et al., 2001; Casasnovas, 2013; Dimitrov, 2004; Li, 2015; Wang, 2002) . Lots of human virus receptors has been identified. The selection of proteins by viruses as receptors is not a random process.Previous studies have shown that proteins that were abundant in the host cell surface or had relatively low affinity for their natural ligands were preferred by viruses as receptors (Dimitrov, 2004; Wang, 2002) . Based on a collection of 119 mammalian virus receptors, our recent study further showed that human virus protein receptors have higher level of N-glycosylation, higher number of interaction partners in the human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and high expressions in 32 common human tissues compared to other cell membrane proteins (Zhang et al., 2019) . These studies could facilitate identification of human virus receptors.Identifying receptors for viruses is challenging. Currently, several experimental approaches have been developed in identifying virus receptors. The first approach is to select candidate membrane proteins that bind to the virus receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) by affinity purification and mass spectroscopy (Free et al., 2009; Ryu, 2016) .The second approach is to select candidate membrane proteins to which the monoclonal antibodies specific could block the virus entry (Minor et al., 1984; Ryu, 2016) . The third approach is to identify the virus receptor by functional cloning selection based on the cDNA expression library (Ryu, 2016) . The protein which could enable viral infection of the non-susceptible cell after transfection would be considered as receptor candidate. However, identifying virus receptor is still time-consuming and difficult at author/funder. All rights reserved.

Besides, limitations on scalability have hampered large-scale identification of viral receptors. The development of computational methods for identifying the human virus receptors is in great need.Previous studies have developed computational models for predicting PPIs between viruses and hosts which could help identification of virus receptors (Lasso et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2019) . For example, Lasso et al. developed an in silico computational framework (P-HIPSTer) that employs structural information to predict more than 280,000 PPIs between 1,001 human-infecting viruses and humans, and made a series of new findings about human-virus interactions (Lasso et al., 2019) . Numerous PPIs between viral RBPs and human cell membrane proteins could be used to identify virus receptors. Here, we developed a computational model to predict the receptorome of the human-infecting virome based on the features of human virus receptors and protein sequences. Combination of the model with Lasso's work further predicted receptors for 693 human-infecting viruses. The study would greatly facilitate identification of human virus receptors.

Human viral receptors, human cell membrane proteins and human membrane proteins

A total of 91 human virus protein receptors were obtained from the viralReceptor database (available at http://www.computationalbiology.cn:5000/viralReceptor) developed in our previous study (Zhang et al., 2019) . Human cell membrane proteins and human membrane proteins were obtained from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database on November 24 th , 2017. The human proteins with the words of ""cell membrane"" and ""cell surface"" in the field of ""Subcellular location"" were considered to be human cell author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967885 doi: bioRxiv preprint membrane proteins. The human proteins with the words of ""membrane"" in the field of ""Subcellular location"" were considered to be human membrane proteins. A total of 2,161 human cell membrane proteins and 5,187 human membrane proteins were obtained.

The protein features and protein sequence features

The N-glycosylation sites of human proteins were obtained from the UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot database. For those proteins without annotation of the N-glycosylation site in the UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot database, the N-glycosylation sites were predicted with NetNGlyc 1.0 (available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) (Gupta et al., 2004) . The level of N-glycosylation for a protein was defined as the number of N-glycosylation sites per hundred amino acids.To calculate the node degree of human proteins in the human PPI network, firstly, the human PPIs with combined scores greater than 400 were extracted from the STRING database (version 10.5) (Szklarczyk et al., 2015) and formed the human PPI network.Then, the node degree was calculated with the functions of degree in the R package igraph (version 1.2.4.2) (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006) .The expression levels of human genes in 32 common human tissues were obtained from the Expression Atlas database (Petryszak et al., 2016) on February 6 th , 2018.Because there were strong correlations between the expressions of genes in different tissues, the principal component analysis (PCA) method was used to reduce the correlations with the function of PCA in the package scikit-learn (version 0.21.3) (Pedregosa et al., 2011) in Python (version 3.6.7). Only the first principal component was used to measure the expression level of human genes, which explained 95% of the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Machine learning modeling

To distinguish human virus receptors from other human cell membrane proteins with machine learning models, the human virus receptors were taken as positive samples, and the human membrane proteins were taken as negative samples after excluding the human cell membrane proteins since the human cell membrane proteins possibly contain virus receptors unidentified yet.Because not all human proteins were observed in the human PPI network used or had observed expressions in the data used, only the human proteins with all three protein features, i.e., the N-glycosylation level, node degree and expression in common human tissues, were used in the modeling. Besides, the sequence redundancy in both human virus receptor proteins and human membrane proteins were removed using CD-HIT (version 4.8.1) (Fu et al., 2012) at 70% identity level. Finally, a total of 88 human virus receptors and 1,593 human membrane proteins was used in the machine learning modeling.The random-forest (RF) model is an ensemble machine learning technique using multiple decision trees and can handle data with high variance and high bias, while the risk of over-fitting can be significantly reduced by averaging multiple trees. Therefore, we chose the RF model to distinguish human virus receptors from other human cell membrane proteins. Because the number of positive samples, i.e., human viral author/funder.

The predictive performances of the RF model were evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

Validation of the RF model in ranking receptor candidates

The predicted interactions between human-infecting viruses and human proteins were To evaluate the ability of the RF model in helping identify virus receptors, 25 pairs of experimentally-validated interactions between viral RBPs and receptors, and the predicted PPIs between these viral RBPs and human cell membrane proteins, were author/funder.

For each viral RBP, the predicted RBP-interacting human cell membrane proteins were ranked by either the LR provided in Lasso's work, or the predicted score provided by the RF model. Then, the ranks of real receptors were analyzed. The rank percentage of the real receptor was calculated by dividing the rank by the number of RBP-interacting human cell membrane proteins.When ranking the RBP-interacting proteins by the RF model, high sequence similarity between the RBP-interacting proteins and human proteins in the modeling (both the positive and negative samples) may over-estimate the ability of the RF model. To reduce such effect, for each pair of viral RBP and receptor, the predicted RBP-interacting human proteins were clustered with human proteins used in the modeling using CD-HIT at 50% identity level. All proteins which were clustered with RBP-interacting proteins were excluded in the modeling.

Development of random-forest models for predicting receptorome of human-infecting virome

Our previous studies have shown that human virus protein receptors have high level of N-glycosylation, high number of interaction partners in the human PPI network, and high expressions in 32 common human tissues (Zhang et al., 2019) . To identify the potential receptors of human-infecting virome, we firstly built a RF model to distinguish the human virus receptor proteins from other human membrane proteins based on these protein features. The RF model built based on individual protein feature achieved an AUC ranging from 0.50 to 0.66 in five-fold cross-validations (Table 1) .Combination of all three features improved the RF model much, with both the AUC and prediction accuracy equaling to 0.75 (Table 1) . author/funder.

The frequencies of k-mers with length of one and two amino acids were used as features in the modeling.The RF model based on combination of 20 amino-acid frequencies achieved an AUC 0.68. When using the frequencies of k-mers with two amino acids as features, only the top N (N=1 to 400) most important features were used in the modeling to reduce over-fitting. Figure S1 showed that the AUC of the RF models increased rapidly as increase of N from 1 to 10. Then, it increased slowly or even decreased when more ten features were used. Therefore, only top ten features were used in the modeling to balance the model performance and complexity. The RF model based on top ten features achieved an AUC of 0.72.To further improve the model for predicting receptorome of human-infecting virome, we incorporated the protein features and the top ten most important k-mers of two amino acids in the modeling. The RF model achieved an AUC of 0.77. The prediction accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the model equaled 0.80, 0.73 and 0.80, respectively ( Table 1) . The model combining both the protein features and k-mers was used for further analysis. 

Prediction of receptorome for human-infecting virome

Based on the RF model, we predicted the receptorome from human cell membrane proteins. A score ranging from 0 to 1 was assigned to each human cell membrane protein. Proteins with high scores are more likely to be virus receptors. A total of 729 proteins with scores greater than 0.5 were considered to constitute the receptorome of human-infecting virome. All human cell membrane proteins and the relevant scores were provided in Table S1 .

Prediction of virus-receptor interactions for human-infecting viruses

Then, we further investigated the prediction of virus-receptor interactions. In previous study, Lasso et al. predicted 282, 528 pairs of PPIs between human and 1,001 human-infecting viruses (Lasso et al., 2019) . Based on their study, 9,395 pairs of PPIs between 718 viral RBPs from 693 human-infecting viruses, and 314 human cell membrane proteins were extracted for further analysis (see Table S2 ). A viral RBP was predicted to interact with 1 to 65 human cell membrane proteins, with a median of 10. For each viral RBP, the RBP-interacting cell membrane proteins were ranked by the score provided by the RF model to select the most likely receptor (Table S2) .author/funder. All rights reserved.

For each pair of these interactions, the rank of the real receptor among the predicted RBP-interacting proteins was obtained, and the related rank percentage was calculated (Materials and Methods). Seven real receptors were ranked in top one by the RF model (Table 2) .Besides, nearly 70% (17/25) of real receptors were ranked in top three. On average, the real receptors had a rank percentage of 0.21 among all RBP-interacting human cell membrane proteins, suggesting that the real receptors would be ranked in the top 21% of all candidates by the RF model.For comparison, we also ranked the RBP-interacting proteins by the LR provided in Lasso's work. In 12 pairs of viral RBP-receptor interaction with LRs, no real receptors were ranked in top one and only two real receptors were ranked in top three when ranking RBP-interacting human cell membrane proteins by the LR. On average, the median rank percentage of real receptors was 0.43 when ranking by the LR, while that was 0.15 by the RF model (Table 2) . 

Prediction of candidate alternative receptors for 2019-nCoV

Previous studies have shown that the ACE2 protein which is the receptor of 2019-nCoV (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) had a low level of expression in the lung and the upper respiratory tract (Qi et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) .

We investigated the prediction of the alternative receptors for 2019-nCoV. Lasso's study have predicted PPIs between 28 human cell membrane proteins which were members of receptorome of human-infecting viruses, and the spike protein of two coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV. We supposed that the 2019-nCoV is very likely to use these spike-interacting proteins as alternative receptors. These spike-interacting proteins were ranked by the score provided by the RF model (Figure 1 ). The expression levels of these spike-interacting proteins in 32 common human tissues were shown in Figure 1 . Most of them had high expressions than ACE2 in the lung, such as APP, EZR, CD4 and so on. (Lasso et al., 2019) . A variable number of human cell membrane proteins were predicted to interact with viral RBPs. To further select the potential receptors for viruses, both the LR and the RF model could be used to rank the viral RBP-interacting human cell membrane proteins. The RF model was found to rank the real receptors better than the LR in a small validation dataset, suggesting that the RF model may perform better than the LR in selecting the real receptors from the predicted RBP-interacting human cell membrane proteins.Combination of the RF model and the RBP-interacting human cell membrane proteins predicted in Lasso's work enables prediction of receptors for 693 human-infecting viruses (Table S2 ). Further efforts are needed to validate these predicted receptors.The 2019-nCoV is responsible for the on-going outbreak of COVID-19 (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Previous studies have shown that the virus used ACE2 as the receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . However, several studies have author/funder. All rights reserved.

It is possibly that the 2019-nCoV may use co-receptor or alternative receptors to facilitate its infection. A previous study investigated the candidate co-receptors of 2019-nCoV, such as ANPEP, ENPEP and DPP4 (Qi et al., 2020) . We further supposed that the 2019-nCoV possibly have alternative receptors.Based on the predicted PPIs between coronaviruses and humans in previous work, we predicted several candidate alternative receptors for 2019-nCoV. Most candidate alternative receptors had higher expressions than ACE2 in the lung. Nevertheless, more efforts are needed to validate these candidate alternative receptors.There are some limitations to this study. Firstly, the number of human virus receptor proteins was much less than that of human membrane proteins in the modeling, which may hinder accurate modeling. The under-sampling method was used to deal with the imbalance problem. Secondly, the performance of the RF model was modest in discriminating the human virus receptor proteins from human membrane proteins.More efforts are needed to improve the model. Thirdly, the RF model can not be used to identify receptors for a specific human-infecting virus. Instead, it predicts the receptorome for the human-infecting virome. Combining the RF model with the model of PPI predictions such as Lasso's work can help identify virus-receptor interactions.In conclusion, this study for the first time built a computational model for predicting the receptorome of the human-infecting virome. It could facilitate identification of human virus receptors in either computational or experimental studies.

"Abstract

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) challenge the well-established sequence-structurefunction paradigm for describing protein function and evolution. Here, we direct a combination of biophysical and cellular studies to further our understanding of how the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail of FtsZ contributes to cell division in rod-shaped bacteria. FtsZ is a modular protein that encompasses a conserved GTPase domain and a highly variable intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail (CTT). The CTT is essential for forming the cytokinetic Z-ring. Despite poor sequence conservation of the CTT, the patterning of oppositely charged residues, which refers to the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within CTT sequences is bounded within a narrow range. To assess the impact of evolutionary bounds on charge patterning within CTT sequences we performed experiments, aided by sequence design, to quantify the impact of changing the patterning of oppositely charged residues within the CTT on the functions of FtsZ from B. subtilis. Z-ring formation is robust if and only if the extent of linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues within the CTT sequences is within evolutionarily observed bounds. Otherwise, aberrant, CTT-mediated, FtsZ assemblies impair Zring formation. The complexities of CTT sequences also have to be above a threshold value because FtsZ variants with low complexity CTTs are not tolerated in cells. Taken together, our results suggest that CTT sequences have evolved to be ""just right"" and that this is achieved through an optimal extent of charge patterning while maintaining the sequence complexity above a threshold value.

","Introduction

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) feature prominently in eukaryotic proteins (Dunker et al., 2002a; van der Lee et al., 2014) . These regions are associated with a range of molecular functions that contribute to an assortment of cellular processes (Dunker et al., 2002b; Iakoucheva et al., 2002; Iakoucheva et al., 2004; Wright and Dyson, 2015) . IDRs and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) defy the well-established sequence-structure-function paradigm that provides a coherent framework for connecting sequence-encoded information to molecular functions for proteins that fold into well-defined three-dimensional structures (Babu, 2016) . This is because conformational heterogeneity is a defining hallmark of IDRs / IDPs (Babu et al., 2012; Forman-Kay and Mittag, 2013; Lyle et al., 2013; Wright and Dyson, 2015) . Despite this sequence-intrinsic conformational heterogeneity it has become clear that IDRs and IDPs have definable sequence-to-conformation relationships (Das et al., 2015; Forman-Kay and Mittag, 2013; Gibbs and Showalter, 2016) . The overall sizes, shapes, and amplitudes of conformational fluctuations of IDRs / IDPs are governed by compositional parameters such as the fraction of charged residues and the overall proline contents (Hofmann et al., 2012; Holehouse et al., 2017; Mao et al., 2013; Muller-Spath et al., 2010) . Additional contributions to sequence-to-conformation relationships include the linear patterning of oppositely charged residues as well as the linear patterning of proline and charged residues Martin et al., 2016) .Progresses in advancing our understanding of sequence-to-conformation relationships of IDRs / IDPs (Mollica et al., 2016; Schneider et al., 2015) have opened the door to using sequence design as a tool to investigate the functional and phenotypic effects of modulating sequence-to-conformation relationships of IDPs / IDRs (Das et al., 2016; Sherry et al., 2017; Staller et al., 2018) . These studies have been directed at yeast proteins that control cell cycle arrest (Das et al., 2016) , mating type switching (Martin et al., 2016) , and transcriptional activation (Staller et al., 2018) and mammalian systems that regulate cell differentiation (Sherry et al., 2017) , tumor suppression (Borcherds et al., 2014) , and transcriptional regulation (Portz et al., 2017) . There is also growing interest in the roles of IDRs / IDPs as modulators of the driving forces for the formation of membraneless organelles and protein-RNA bodies in eukaryotic systems (Dao et al., 2018; Harmon et al., 2017; Hernandez-Vega et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Mitrea et al., 2018; Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016; Wei et al., 2017) .In contrast to eukaryotic systems and viruses, where the functional importance of IDRs / IDPs is reasonably well established (Berlow et al., 2017; Jensen et al., 2011; Mollica et al., 2016; Wright and Dyson, 2015) , the prevailing dogma is that bacterial proteins largely conform to the classical sequence-structure-function paradigm (Dunker et al., 2015; Pavlovic-Lazetic et al., 2011) . This view has emerged from bioinformatics analysis, which shows that only a small percentage of bacterial proteins include long IDRs (Brown et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2006; Yruela et al., 2017) . The apparent bias against IDRs / IDPs in bacterial proteomes has been ascribed to a variety of factors. These include shorter protein lengths, the importance of well-defined structure in metabolic enzymes, and the purportedly focused / limited repertoire of functions associated with bacterial proteins (Brown et al., 2010; Dunker et al., 2001; Yruela et al., 2017) .However, recent studies have demonstrated that while IDRs / IDPs may make up a small fraction of proteins / protein regions in bacterial proteomes when compared to eukaryotic ones, the synergies between IDRs and folded domains contribute directly to an assortment of functions. Prominent bacterial IDRs / IDPs include proteins involved in regulating cell division (Buske and Levin, 2013; Buske et al., 2015) , DNA replication (Kozlov et al., 2015; Shereda et al., 2008) , protein and RNA quality control (Ait- Foit et al., 2013; Jakob et al., 2014; Quan et al., 2014; Reichmann et al., 2012; Updegrove et al., 2016) , bacterial warfare (Bonsor et al., 2008; Hecht et al., 2009; Papadakos et al., 2015) , biofilm formation (Gruszka et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2017; Whelan and Potts, 2015) , and chemotaxis (Daughdrill et al., 1997; Dedmon et al., 2002; Ding et al., 2009) . These findings raise a key dimerization step and the elongation of polymers (Caplan and Erickson, 2003; Romberg et al., 2001) . Filaments can associate laterally with one another to form bundles (Gonzalez et al., 2005; Romberg and Levin, 2003) . GTP hydrolysis promotes the bending of laterally associated polymers to form wreath-like structures that vary in thickness around the circumference (den Blaauwen et al., 2017) .Calorimetric measurements suggest that the formation of FtsZ assemblies requires the crossing of a critical concentration threshold (Caplan and Erickson, 2003; Chen et al., 2005) . This apparent cooperativity is at odds with the observation that FtsZ forms stable singlestranded filaments, which is the defining characteristic of isodesmic assembly (Oosawa and Kasai, 1962) . Numerous models have been developed to describe how FtsZ assembles cooperatively. These models suggest that FtsZ subunits might undergo conformational changes to facilitate the population of a high affinity state that favors polymerization (Miraldi et al., 2008) .Detailed molecular and structural evidence for such a high affinity state remains elusive. In this context, it is worth noting that most models for FtsZ assembly have been motivated primarily by the structure and dynamics of the conserved and well-folded GTPase domain.We propose that clues to the observed complexities and regulation of FtsZ assembly come from the distinctive protein architecture, which include modules other than the GTPase domain ( Figure 1A) . The modular architecture of FtsZ encompasses a folded N-terminal core domain that forms an active GTP hydrolysis site upon dimerization. The negatively charged core includes the GTP binding site and the coordinating T7 loop. The interface between the nucleotide binding site and the T7 loop (in dimers and higher order polymers) forms the active site for GTP hydrolysis (Oliva et al., 2007) . The C-terminal stretch of FtsZ includes an intrinsically disordered linker (CTL), a 17-residue C-terminal peptide (CTP), and 7-10 residue stretch that is rich in basic residues and has been designated as the C-terminal variable region or CTV Levin, 2012, 2013; Buske et al., 2015) . The CTP is an alpha-helical 7 molecular recognition element (Oldfield et al., 2005) that coordinates heterotypic protein-protein interactions involving FtsZ. The interaction partners that engage with FtsZ through the CTP include the protein FtsA, which assists in the bundling of FtsZ protofilaments and anchoring of Z-rings to bacterial membranes, and SepF, which is required for the late stages of cell division (Adams and Errington, 2009) . Depending on its charge, the CTV can play a significant role in mediating lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers in vitro and in determining the integrity of the FtsZ ring in vivo (Buske and Levin, 2012) .Previous studies showed that deletion of the CTL leads to aberrant FtsZ assembly that compromises Z-ring formation and cell division (Buske and Levin, 2013) . Replacing the wildtype (WT) CTL with a scrambled sequence variant of the linker preserves Z-ring formation and cell division. In contrast, replacing the CTL with a rigid alpha-helical domain from human betacatenin yielded diffuse FtsZ puncta that compromise Z-ring formation and cell division (Buske and Levin, 2013) . This work underscored the importance of the disordered CTL in FtsZ assembly and Z-ring formation. It also raised several questions regarding the contribution of the intrinsically disordered CTL to the assortment of functions coordinated by FtsZ. Here, we pursue answers to some of these questions by leveraging insights that have emerged through systematic studies of sequence-encoded conformational preferences of intrinsically disordered proteins / regions (Das et al., 2015) .We focus here on the CTL of B. subtilis FtsZ because its amino acid compositional bias is similar, in terms of the fraction of charged residues and net charge per residue, to that of a third of the CTL sequences in rod-shaped bacteria (Buske et al., 2015) . The fraction of charged residues is 0.33 and the net charge per residue is +0.06 implying that the CTT is polyampholytic.The overall sizes, shapes, and amplitudes of conformational fluctuations of polyampholytic sequences are governed by a combination of the fraction of charged residues, the net charge per residue, the length of the IDR, and the linear patterning of oppositely charged residues (Das All rights reserved.

In polyampholytic IDRs, oppositely charged residues can be separated into distinct blocks or they can be uniformly mixed along the sequence ( Figure 1B) . The linear mixing / segregation of oppositely charged residues can be quantified using different parameters Sawle and Ghosh, 2015; Sawle et al., 2017) . The one we use here is designated as κ, where 0 ≤ κ ≤ 1 . If oppositely charged residues are well mixed, then the sequence will have low κ-values. In contrast, separation of oppositely charged residues into discrete blocks within the linear sequence leads to higher values of κ. In well-mixed sequences, preferential solvation of charged residues combined with a counterbalancing of intra-chain electrostatic repulsions and attractions will promote chain expansion. Increased linear segregation of oppositely charged residues causes systematic compaction of IDRs leading to smaller values for radii of gyration, more spherical shapes for individual molecules, and decreased amplitudes of global conformational fluctuations ( Figure   1B) .A recent analysis of polyampholytic IDRs drawn from the human proteome showed an inverse correlation between median κ-values and median values for the fraction of charged residues . Importantly, based on random distributions of disordered sequences with an FCR ≈ 0.3 there is a clear evolutionary preference for sequences with higher than randomly expected κ-values ( Figure S1 ). Interestingly, previous studies also showed that there is a clear selection against sequences with higher values of κ (> 0.45) . These observations also apply to CTT sequences drawn from 1209 orthologous FtsZ proteins (Buske et al., 2015) . Here, we explore the functional and phenotypic impacts of charge segregation / mixing within the polyampholytic CTT of FtsZ in B. subtilis. We studied the impact of varying κ within the CTT of B. subtilis FtsZ and quantified the impact of changing κ on CTT conformations, cell division, Z-ring formation, cell growth, and the biophysical aspects of FtsZ polymerization and GTPase activity.

Results

CTT κ-values span a narrow range even though CTL sequences are hypervariable:We quantified the evolutionary conservation of different regions within FtsZ across 1209 orthologous proteins. We used the sequences of G-actin derived from orthologs as a reference for this analysis because these sequences are highly conserved across evolution. We used the mean conservation score for G-actin to normalize the conservation scores for different regions of FtsZ. The results are shown in Figure 1C . The core of FtsZ and the CTP motif show considerably higher degrees of conservation when compared to the CTL and CTV regions, which are poorly conserved.We also calculated the distribution of κ-values for CTT sequences derived from 1209 distinct orthologs ( Figure 1D) . Given the conservation of the CTP, it follows that the variation in κ is mainly due to sequence variations within the CTL. Roughly 95% of the CTT κ values are within the interval 0.13 < κ < 0.36. The CTT from B. subtilis FtsZ has a κ value of 0.19. The expected distribution of κ values for randomly shuffled sequences that are constrained to have the CTT composition of B. subtilis FtsZ is shifted to lower values when compared to the actual κ values observed for the 1209 orthologous sequences ( Figure S2 ). However, when compared to the shuffled sequences generated in the absence of any selective pressure, many sequences with higher κ values are found, although very few naturally occurring sequences have a κ value above 0.4. This suggests that there is an evolutionary pressure against CTT sequences with κ values that go above 0.4. Similarly, there appears to be a selection pressure against sequences with κ values lower than 0.15.

Design of sequence variants of B. subtilis FtsZ:

To test the impact of changing CTT κ values on FtsZ function, we designed a set of sequence variants of B. subtilis FtsZ. In these variants, we fixed the GTPase core domain, the amino acid composition of the CTL, and the sequence of the CTP. We shuffled the positions of charged and neutral residues within the B.subtilis CTL to generate sequence variants of the CTT that span the spectrum of κ values between 0.1 and 0.8. There are roughly 10 40 sequences that satisfy the design criteria ( Figure   2A ). Of these, we selected six variants of B. subtilis FtsZ and each of these variants is distinguished by the κ value for the CTT, which spans the range from 0.15 to 0.72 (Figure 2A and Figure 2B ). Each of the designed B. subtilis FtsZ variants is designated as CTLVx, where x is an integer value that increases as the CTT κ value increases.Sequence-intrinsic conformational preferences of CTT sequences are influenced by the extent of charge segregation: We performed atomistic simulations of the WT CTT from B. subtilis FtsZ and the six designed variants. We used the ABSINTH implicit solvation model and forcefield paradigm (Vitalis and Pappu, 2009a; Vitalis and Pappu, 2009b) for these simulations. The results were used to quantify the impact of charge patterning on the overall sizes, shapes, and amplitudes of conformational fluctuations of CTT sequences modeled as autonomous units. As κ increases, there is a clear trend toward compaction. We quantified the preference for compact structures in terms of the length normalized mean radii of gyration R g n that are plotted for the WT CTT and designed variants ( Figure 2C ). For each variant, R g n is calculated as the mean R g value of the variant divided by the square root of the number of residues n in the CTT. Variants of the B. subtilis CTT sequence with κ values that are lower than the WT are slightly more expanded than the WT CTT, although the degree of expansion is not statistically significant. However, sequences with κ values that are higher than the WT become increasingly more compact with increasing κ. It follows, in accord with previous observations for other systems (Das et al., 2016; Das and Pappu, 2013; Sherry et al., 2017) , All rights reserved.

These parameters are quantified in terms of the radii of gyration (R g ) and asphericities (δ * ) that are achievable via spontaneous conformational fluctuations ( Figure 2D ). Distributions of R g and δ * for each of the designed CTT sequences are shown in Figure S3A . The diversity of sizes and shapes can be quantified using the (R g , δ * ) distributions and summarized in terms of a normalized Shannon entropy (s). Larger values of s imply a greater diversity of and sizes and shapes.A large number of distinct conformations might be compatible with similar values of R g and δ * . Here, we refer to this feature as the ruggedness of the energy landscape. Following previous approaches , we quantify ruggedness in terms of the degree of similarity / dissimilarity of backbone dihedral angles among every pair of conformations sampled by each variant. This yields a distribution of similarity / dissimilarity values denoted as p(D) and we take the mean value, denoted as D to be an average measure of backbone dihedral angle similarity / dissimilarity. For a well-folded protein, such as the FtsZ core, the value of D will be small because the backbone dihedral angles of distinct conformations that are accessible as a result of spontaneous fluctuations will be similar to one another. In contrast, the value of D will be higher for systems that sample conformations with distinctly different patterns of backbone dihedral angles.The combination of values for s and D will define the sequence-specific topography of the energy landscape. This aspect is schematized in Figure S3B in terms of a one-dimensional projection of the energy landscape along a single conformational coordinate that combines the contributions of sizes, shapes, and backbone dihedral angles.

Figure 2E shows the values of D and s for the WT CTT and each of the designed CTT variants. These results show that of the seven CTT sequences, the WT sequence best conforms to the designation of encoding a wide and smooth landscape.The energy landscapes of CTT sequences become progressively more rugged (increasing D) with increasing κ, although the landscapes for variants CTLV1, CTLV2, CTLV3, and CTLV4 retain the width (similar s values) of the WT CTT. The energy landscapes of CTT sequences from CTLV5 and CLTV6 are fundamentally different in that they become narrower (smaller s values) and more rugged (larger D values) . Overall, our analysis shows that the WT CTT stands out as the sequence with nearly the highest conformational diversity in terms of global sizes and shapes (high s value) and the lowest ruggedness, given that it has the lowest D value.Cellular phenotypes are robust in B. subtilis that express variants CTLV2, CTLV3, and CTLV4: We used in cell investigations to probe the impact of designed changes to CTT sequences on cell division and cell growth in B. subtilis. Western blots in Figure 3A show that the cellular levels of FtsZ variants are sensitive to sequence-encoded features within the CTT.FtsZ variants with extreme κ values for their CTT sequences such as CTLV1 and CTLV6 are not well tolerated by the cells (Figure 3A ). This in turn influences Z-ring formation because it diminishes the cellular levels of the FtsZ variants. Clone verification using restriction digests and sequencing at the vector-insert junctions showed that the constructs were correctly cloned.Instead, it appears that variants that have low cellular levels are actively degraded as opposed to being under expressed.In cells where CTLV1 reaches a sufficient concentration, well-defined Z-rings are formed ( Figure 3B ). The cellular levels of CTLV2, CTLV3, and CTLV4 are not compromised by the designed changes to the CTT sequences ( Figure 3A ). Cells expressing these three variants show robust Z-ring formation. This is true even though the κ values for their CTT sequences All rights reserved.

However, Z-ring formation is compromised for cells expressing variants CTLV5 (κ=0.46) and CTLV6 (κ=0.72) ( Figure 3B ). These results suggest that increased segregation of oppositely charged residues within the CTT sequence leads to a disruption of Z-ring formation and haphazard localization of FtsZ puncta that in turn inhibit cell division.To quantify the robustness / disruption of Z-ring formation, we measured the L/R ratio, which describes the ratio of the average length of the cell to the number of Z-rings observed (Buske and Levin, 2013) . This is a measure of the fitness and robustness of cell division in rodshaped bacteria. The L/R ratio is 7.2 ± 1.2 for cells expressing WT FtsZ. Compromised fitness is indicated by L/R ratios that are larger than the WT. The L/R ratio is 5.9 ± 1.1, 6.6 ± 1.0, and 5.8 ± 0.9 for cells expressing variants CTLV2, CTLV3, and CTLV4, respectively ( Figure 3C ). These measurements suggest robust Z-ring formation and division for cells expressing FtsZ variants with CTT κ values between 0.18 and 0.40. In contrast, the L/R ratio is 18.8 ± 1.6, 57.5 ± 12.5, and 117.3 ± 27.6 for cells expressing variants CTLV1 (CTT κ=0.15), CTLV5 (CTT κ=0.46), and CTLV6 (CTT κ=0.72), respectively.The higher L/R ratio for CTLV1 is likely due to lowered cellular levels ( Figure 3A ). The in vivo behavior we observe for cells expressing CTLV5 and CTLV6 cannot be explained in terms of reduced protein levels alone ( Figure 3B) . Therefore, as an additional measure of cell division efficiency we monitored the rate of change of optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ), which is proportional to the concentration of cells in mid-log phase of growth. A reduction in OD 600 would arise from the combination of a decrease in the efficiency of cell division, compromised metabolism, and increased cell death. As shown in Figure 3E , cells expressing CTLV5 and CTLV6 show a reduction in the rate of increase of OD 600 , indicating that CTLV5 and CTLV6 cause a significant reduction of the cellular growth rate. In contrast, cells expressing all other All rights reserved.

Accordingly, the active form of the enzyme is a dimer and GTP is hydrolyzed at the interface of the GTP binding site and the T7 loop ( Figure S4A ). GTP binding promotes dimerization and the formation of higher-order headto-tail polymers of FtsZ. In the dimeric state, GTP hydrolysis at the subunit interface leads to dissociation into two monomers (Scheffers et al., 2002) . In the polymeric form, GTP hydrolysis promotes bending and ring formation (Erickson et al., 2010) .Recent studies have shown that the CTT also has a role to play in polymerization and Zring formation, in vitro and in vivo (Buske and Levin, 2013) . Right-angle light scattering is a sensitive method for studying FtsZ polymerization and bundling of FtsZ polymers in the presence of GTP. Outputs from a typical light scattering assay are shown in Figure S4B . In these experiments, the concentration of FtsZ is above the apparent critical threshold for polymerization, which was found to be 2.5 µM in the presence of 50 mM KCl, in a pH 6.5, 50 mM MES buffer (Caplan and Erickson, 2003) . Upon the introduction of 1 mM GTP into the solution mixture, the scattering intensity increases within a narrow time interval and rapidly reaches a steady state value. Light scattering is sensitive to the presence of large aggregates and these might include linear polymers, bundled polymers, or even large spherical assemblies.We collected samples at the mid-point of the scattering assay and performed deep etch electron microscopy imaging. A representative image for WT FtsZ is shown in Figure 4A . These images reveal the formation of linear and curved protofilaments that are roughly 100 nm long.The light scattering data in Figure S4B were obtained in the presence of 50 mM KCl.Previous studies showed that FtsZ can form bundled polymers and the extent of bundling is All rights reserved.

Figure 4B shows comparative light scattering traces obtained in the presence of different concentrations of KCl. The steady-state scattering intensity decreases sharply as salt concentration is increased.Negative stain EM imaging shows that the FtsZ polymers form large bundles at low salt and this bundling is disrupted at high salt ( Figure 4C ). The EM data together with the light scattering data suggest that the scattering intensity derives mainly from the bundling of FtsZ polymers, as opposed to the formation of linear polymers.Next, we studied the salt dependence of the light scattering traces obtained for CTLV4.This variant is of interest because it maintains cellular phenotypes despite an increase of the CTT κ by a factor of two when compared to the WT CTT. Like WT, we observed a canonical dependence of light scattering intensity on monovalent salt ( Figure 4D ). At high salt, the interactions that hold the bundles together are screened and CTLV4 forms unbundled polymers that are similar to those formed by WT FtsZ (Figure 4E ). Simulations predict the CTT of CTLV4 is 10% smaller than the WT CTT ( Figure 2C ). Compaction is mediated by increased electrostatic interactions between charged blocks on the CTT sequence. While the simulations illustrate charge-dependent intramolecular interactions, these interactions could also occur in an intermolecular fashion. Concordant with this expectation, we observed a two-fold increase in the peak scattering intensity in the presence of 50 mM KCl for the CTLV4 variant when compared to the WT FtsZ ( Figure 4F ). This increase in scattering intensity derives from two distinct features as revealed by negative stain EM images ( Figure 4E) . When compared to the WT FtsZ, CTLV4 forms longer polymers that become part of thicker bundles in the presence of low salt. Figure   4F shows a comparison of the relative strengths of filament / polymer bundling by comparing the maximum scattering intensities measured for the WT versus CTLV4 in the presence of three different concentrations of KCl. The major differences between the variants are manifest at low salt. However, under physiologically relevant salt concentrations, the morphological differences All rights reserved.

Therefore, while the CTT of CTLV4 can be involved in enhanced tail-mediated interactions, especially at low salt, this does not deleteriously affect polymerization or bundling of CTLV4. These data provide an explanation for the observed robustness of Z-ring formation and cell division for cells expressing CTLV4 as well as cells expressing variants CTLV2 and CTLV3.To further assess the robustness of altering charge patterning within evolutionarily observed bounds (Figure 1D) , we quantified the comparative efficiencies of GTP hydrolysis of FtsZ variants. Figure 4G shows results from measurements that compare the efficiencies of WT FtsZ to those for CTLV4 and ∆CTT. The latter is a variant of FtsZ that lacks the CTT. The efficiency of GTP hydrolysis remains unchanged for CTLV4 when compared to the WT FtsZ ( Figure 4G ). Higher-order assembly, such as protofilament bundling and Z-ring formation, are compromised for ∆CTT (Buske and Levin, 2013; Sundararajan and Goley, 2017; Sundararajan et al., 2015) and we do not observe a measurable increase in light scattering that is distinguishable from the background. Despite this, we find that ∆CTT is much more efficient as a GTPase with an enzymatic activity that is ~3 times higher than the WT or CTLV4. Taken together with the observation that GTP hydrolysis promotes the severing of protofilaments (Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus, 1998) our data suggest that ∆CTT, as a result of being unencumbered by the absence of the CTT, is able to bind GTP, polymerize, hydrolyze GTP, disassemble and repeat the cycle in an extremely efficient manner. Accordingly, we propose that the CTT, which is essential for Z-ring formation, promotes FtsZ assembly and this suppresses GTPase activity. This suppression could arise from steric effects of the CTT, a reduction in subunit turnover, and possible protofilament stabilization through interactions with neighboring filaments mediated by the CTT.CTLV5 and CTLV6 drive alternative modes of polymerization even in the absence of GTP: Given the deleterious phenotypic impacts associated with CTLV5 and CTLV6, we All rights reserved.

We performed light scattering assays for CTLV5 and CTLV6 in the presence and absence of GTP. The light scattering data obtained in the presence of GTP show a WT-like decrease in light scattering intensity at physiological concentrations of monovalent salt ( Figure 5A ). In 50 mM KCl, CTLV5forms large linear filaments that are not bundled ( Figure 5B) . Surprisingly, even in the absence of GTP, CTLV5 forms discernible assemblies that persist at high salt concentrations ( Figure   5C ). This behavior is distinct from what we observe for WT FtsZ and CTLV4. The assemblies formed by CTLV5 in the absence of GTP are spherical aggregates that are roughly 20 nm in diameter ( Figure 5D ). Interestingly, light scattering from these assemblies that form in the absence of GTP, increases with increased salt concentration. Relative CTLV5 light scattering magnitudes for different buffer conditions are shown in Figure 5E . The increased assembly size in high salt might derive from a weakening of electrostatic repulsions amongst the surfaces of assemblies. This is clearly a CTT-mediated phenomenon given that we do not observe these assemblies for the wild-type FtsZ or for variants with lower degrees of charge segregation within their CTTs.Of the designed variants, CTLV6 has the most extreme degree of segregation of oppositely charged residues in its CTT. Increased segregation of oppositely charged residues within the CTT drives increased self-association of FtsZ via inter-tail interactions between filaments. These interactions generate profoundly different assemblies when compared to the morphologies that we observe for wild-type FtsZ or other designed variants ( Figure 5F ). The spacing between filaments corresponds to the length of a fully extended CTT. This is suggestive of zippering interactions between tails with ""blocky"" (charge-segregated) sequences. These assemblies persist at physiological salt concentrations in the presence of GTP (Figure S5A &B) ,indicating that they likely form in the cellular setting as well. At 200 mM KCl, we observe morphologies that are similar to those seen in 50 mM KCl ( Figure S5C) . We further observed a All rights reserved.

1 transmission routes 2 Sk Shahid Nadim a , Indrajit Ghosh 1a , Joydev Chattopadhyay a 3 Abstract 5In this paper, we study the dynamics of a vector-borne disease model with two transmission paths: direct transmission through contact and indirect transmission through vector. The direct transmission is considered to be a non-monotone incidence function to describe the psychological effect of some severe diseases among the population when the number of infected hosts is large and/or the disease possesses high case fatality rate. The system has a disease-free equilibrium which is locally asymptomatically stable when the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is less than unity and may have up to four endemic equilibria. Analytical expression representing the epidemic growth rate is obtained for the system. Sensitivity of the two transmission pathways were compared with respect to the epidemic growth rate. We numerically find that the direct transmission coefficient is more sensitive than the indirect transmission coefficient with respect to R 0 and the epidemic growth rate. Local stability of endemic equilibria is studied. Further, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved using Li and Muldowney geometric approach. The explicit condition for which the system undergoes backward bifurcation is obtained. The basic model also exhibits the hysteresis phenomenon which implies diseases will persist even when R 0 < 1 although the system undergoes a forward bifurcation and this phenomenon is rarely observed in disease models. Consequently, our analysis suggests that the diseases with multiple transmission routes exhibit bi-stable dynamics. However, efficient application of temporary control in bi-stable regions will curb the disease to lower endemicity. In addition, increase in transmission heterogeneity will increase the chance of disease eradication. 7 12 directly by person-to-person contact and indirectly through a vector. Understanding the transmission 13 dynamics of such diseases is of utmost interest. Mathematical models of epidemic diseases have been 14 very insightful in uncovering epidemiology and transmission patterns of the diseases. It is very important 15 to understand such epidemic patterns for better public health interventions and control of outbreaks. 16 Another important objective of these models is to inform public health organizations about the effect of 17 control policies on a certain population. However, hosts behaviour and psychological factors are some-18 times the main drivers of further transmission of the disease. For example, the epidemic outbreak of 19 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (3; 4) had such psychological effects and individual protection 20 1 doi: bioRxiv preprint 32 However, the dynamics of an epidemic model with two transmission routes where the direct trans-33 mission incorporates psychological effect has not been studied so far. The ongoing MERS-CoV epidemic 34 and zika virus epidemic are examples of diseases with two routes of transmission having psychological 35 effects. The psychosocial implication on the disease outbreak is more dangerous than any other phys-36 ical effect. West Nile Virus outbreak in the US is a good example for the onset of psychogenic illness 37 (10) and may generate mistrust towards national or health authorities. For example, the mild effects 38 of Zika virus, there is a correlation between psychosis with fetus microcephaly where pregnant women 39and their relatives are highly sensitive group. Therefore, there is a negative correlation between the 40 psychological effect and disease prevalence and hence we consider non-monotone incidence function i.e 41 p < q to describe the direct transmission between hosts in our study. This type of function can be used 42 to interpret the ""psychological effects"" (11). We use the incidence rate g(I)S = βIS 1+αI 2 where βI repre-43 sent the force of infection of the diseases, 1 1+αI 2 represent the psychological effect from the behavioral 44 changes of susceptible population when the number of infected populations increases. Our goal is to 45 develop a simple mathematical model that capture a range of disease dynamics with multiple mode of 46 transmissions. Moreover, we would like to perform a detailed stability and bifurcation analysis of the 47 proposed model. By using analytical methods we intend to uncover the dynamical properties of the 48 diseases with two routes of transmission.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 consist of the model formulation and the 50 basic assumptions. In Section 3, preliminary mathematical analysis of the proposed model is carried out.Section 4 is devoted to the global stability of the endemic equilibrium using geometric approach while 52 in Section 5 backward bifurcation and forward bifurcation with hysteresis effect is presented. In Section 53 6 we investigate some numerical scenarios such as effect of temporary control on bistable dynamics, 54 effect of the strength of psychological fear and impact of heterogeneity in indirect transmission. Finally, 55 discussion and conclusion is presented in Section 7. 56 2. Model formulation 57 We consider two population groups as host and vector population. Time-dependent state variables 58 are taken to describe the compartments of the two populations. Let at time t, N h (t) represents total 59 host population and N v (t) represents total vector population. We consider a 'SIR' type model for the 60 host population and a 'SI' type model for the vectors. The host population is subdivided into three 61 mutually disjoint classes: susceptible, S h ; infected, I h ; recovered, R h . Thus, at any time t, the size of 62 the host population is given by N h = S h + I h + R h . The vector population consist of two classes namely, 63 susceptible vectors, S v ; and infected vectors, I v . With this division, the size of the vector population 64 2 . CC-BY 4.0 The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is the number of secondary infections which one infected indi-102 vidual would produce in a entirely susceptible population. The disease free equilibrium (DFE) of the 103 system is given by Y 0 = ( Π h µ h , 0, 0, Πv µv , 0). There are two infected compartments in the model (2.1), I h 104and I v . R 0 can be derived from the jacobian matrix of the system (2.1) calculated at Y 0 together with 105 the assumption of local asymptotic stability of Y 0 and is given by

The mode of transmission of some infectious diseases may be through both direct and indirect con-9 tact. In direct transmission, a pathogen can infect a susceptible host through infected host, and in 10 indirect transmission, a pathogen can infect a susceptible host through an infected vector. For instance, 11 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (1) and Zika virus (2) may be spread both policies have been found very effective (5; 6) in decreasing the rate of infection at the late stage of SARS outbreak, even when the number of infective individuals were getting larger relatively. Additionally, the influenza pandemic of 2009 has triggered a psychological effect that caused adoption of preventive 23 measures by a significant portion of the population (4). Recent MERS-CoV outbreak in Arabian penin-24 sula also imposed a significant behaviour change in the local people (1) . Thus, psychological effects 25 are necessary in modelling infectious disease transmission. The general incidence rate in this context at time t is given by N v (t) = S v (t) + I v (t). We assume all newborn hosts are fully susceptible. The susceptible host population increases at a constant rate Π h . The susceptible population decreases due to 66 getting infection from infected vectors and infected hosts and natural mortality at a rate µ h . Therefore Interpretations of all the model parameters and their biological meanings are given in the Table 1 . We assume that the vector and host state variables are non-negative for all t ≥ 0. Let

We claim the following result.Theorem 3.1. Whenever the initial conditions are non-negative, model (2.1) has non-negative solutions and the region Ω ∈ R 5 + is positively invariant and globally attracting for the above system. 84 Proof. We can rewrite the system (2.1) in the following form 85 86 dy dt = g(y) (3. 1) with y = (y 1 , y 2 , y 3 , y 4 , y 5 ) = (S h , I h , R h , S v , I v ) and g(y) = (g 1 (y), g 2 (y), g 3 (y), g 4 (y), g 5 (y)) denote the 87 right hand side of the functions as in the following 88 89Clearly, for every j = 1, ..., 5, g j (x) ≥ 0 if y ∈ R 5 + and y j = 0. Since the host and vector populations 90 are non-negative, thus the right hand side of the system (3.1) is locally Lipschitz in Ω. Following (12) 91 and (13), we see that the system (2.1) has a unique solution. The following equations are satisfied by 92 the total host and vector populations, if R 0 > 1.

Proof. The Jacobian of the system (2.1) at DFE Y 0 is given as follows(3.5)Then the characteristic equation of (3.5) is given byThe eigenvalues of this jacobian matrix is Note that λ is the EGR for the 'SIR' sub-model of the system (2.1) and is given byIf there is no indirect transmission through vector(β i → 0), then the system (2.1) becomes the 129 sub-model (3.8) and λ → λ. Additionally, from (3.6), it can be noted thatThe mean time spent in the infected host class is dependent on the host lifetime, the mean infectious 137 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/486720 doi: bioRxiv preprint(3.12)Provided, the observed growth rate λ obs is equal to the EGR λ for the 'SIRSI' model (2.1). Since

Proposition 2. Let R 0 > 1 and R 0 is fixed for system (2.1). Let dλ dβ i denote the total derivative of λ 159 with respect to β i . Then dλ dβ i < 0.

160

Proof. The EGR λ is explicitly dependent on both β i and β d . From the analytical expression of R 0 , β d 161 can be determined in terms of β i as,(3.7) is involved in the expression of R SIRSI 0 given by (3.10). We will calculate the total derivative of λ:Since R 0 is fixed and using (3.13), the total derivative of (3.10) gives(3.14)(3.15)We have R 0 > 1, λ ≥ λ and λ > 0. Finally, µ v > 0. Thus, the numerator become positive and the 165 denominator is negative in (3.15), giving that dλ dβ i < 0.

166

Now we calculate the relationship of dλ dβ i with ∂λ ∂β i and ∂λ ∂β d as follows:Corollary 3.1. Let R 0 > 1 and the initial EGR λ be given by (3.6).To verify this result numerically, sensitivity index of λ with respect to the parameters β d and β i 169 are computed. The normalized forward sensitivity index of a quantity with respect to a parameter 170 is defined as the ratio of the relative change in the variable to the relative change in the parameter.

171

Mathematically, the normalized forward sensitivity index of a variable m that depends explicitly on a 172 parameter τ is defined as:The normalized forward sensitivity indices of λ with respect to the parameters β d and β i are found tofor the parameters value Π h = 5,The fact that X β d λ = 1.6631 means that 1% increase in β d , keeping other parameters fixed, will produce In this section we discuss the existence of endemic equilibria and its stability conditions.

Therefore, equat-188 ing the right hand sides of the equations of system (2.1) to zero, we haveand I * h comes from the equationwhere, Table 2 and Table 3 . Theorem 4.1. The system (2.1) has unique endemic equilibrium Y * if R 0 > 1 and cases 1, 2, 6 and 10 202 in Table 2 are satisfied, and has unique endemic equilibrium Y * if R 0 < 1 and cases 3, 4, 5 and 14 in 203   Table 3 are satisfied. The system (2.1) could have more than one endemic equilibrium if R 0 > 1 and 204 cases 3 − −5, 7 − −9, 11 − −13, 15 and 16 in Table 2 are satisfied, and could have more than one endemic 205 equilibrium if R 0 < 1 and cases 2, 6 − −13, 15 and 16 in Table 3 are satisfied.

Therefore, We can study the model in the following regionHowever, before going to the main result, let us discuss some preliminary results and definitions. Consider the autonomous dynamical system:ẋwhere f : D → R n , D ⊂ R n open set and simply connected and f ∈ C 1 (D). Let x * be the solution oflocally stable and all trajectories in D converges to x * .

The Lozinskii measure µ(A) with respect to the norm . in R N , N = n 2 , is defined as (18),We will apply the following (18)The system (2.1) admits exactly one endemic equilibrium Y * when R 0 > 1 for the cases 1, 2, 6, 10 in Table 2 . Further, we know that the DFE Y 0 is unstable when R 0 > 1. The instability of P 0 , together with P 0 ∈ ∂Θ, which implies the uniform persistence of the state variable (21). Thus there exists a constant c > 0 such that any solution (The uniform persistence of the system (4.4), incorporating the boundedness of Θ , suggests that the Table 2 are satisfied andThen, the unique endemic equilibrium Y * of the system (2.1) is globally asymptotically stable in region 245 Θ.

246

Proof. We show the global stability of Y * using the Muldowney's Theorem 4.2. We have to prove the 247 following to apply the theorem: 248 1. There exists a compact absorbing set K in the interior of Θ.

249

2. There is a number ν > 0 such that the Lozinskii measure satisfies µ(A) < −ν.

The uniform persistence together with the boundedness of Θ is equivalent to the existence of an 251 absorbing compact set in the interior of Θ(22). Now we have to prove that the Lozinskii measure

When the multiple stable equilibrium coexist then the population will reach 386 the final equilibrium depending on the initial conditions. Backward bifurcation phenomenon for the 387 system (2.1) is shown in Fig. 1 . Here, a stable DFE and a stable endemic equilibrium point coexist 388 when 0 < R c < R 0 < 1, where R c is the critical value, which is shown in Fig. 1 and R c = 0.274 for the 389 given parameters values. In Fig. 1 , the green line represents the unstable equilibrium, while the blue line is established analytically.

Hysteresis

For forward transcritical bifurcation usually a model has two locally stable branches, one is DFE 427 when R 0 < 1, which is locally asymptotically stable and another is endemic equilibrium when R 0 > 1, 428 which is stable. But there may be more than one stable endemic equilibrium for the model when R 0 > 1.

429

It is possible that more than one endemic equilibrium coexist in epidemic models even when R 0 > 1.

430

This leads to an unusual phenomenon of forward bifurcation with hysteresis effect, which is shown 431 numerically for our model (2.1). We find that our model exhibits a hysteresis effect where multiple 432 endemic equilibrium coexist for R 0 > 1 (see Fig. 2 ). The blue line represents two outer equilibrium, 433 which is stable while the green line represent the interior equilibrium, which is unstable. Further investigation reveals that the endemic equilibrium may also be stable in a region where 435 R 0 < 1 (see Fig. 3 ). This indicates that the disease may persist for R 0 < 1, even if the type of 436 transcritical bifurcation at R 0 = 1 is forward. Similarly, in case of hysteresis, these control measures will compel the solutions to the basin of attraction 447 of the lower endemic equilibrium. Here, we control the indirect transmission rate (β i ) for a certain period 448 of time, to force the solutions of the system to lower endemic value. We use the following to model thisFor backward bifurcation case, we observe that a solution of the system approaches the upper equi- The vector-host interaction is assumed to be well-mixed in the proposed model 2.

Since k 1 and k 2 both are the levels of heterogeneity, we assumed that k 1 = k 2 = k for simplicity.

Further investigation reveals that increase in transmission heterogeneity will ensure fast eradication of 511 the disease.

"Abstract

The COVID-19 disease is rapidly spreading in whole globe, affecting millions of people and pushing governments to take drastic measures to contain the outbreaks. The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and predicted. With this approach the lack of data due to the still ongoing Italian epidemic was compensated by the Chinese experience, allowing to obtain a SIRD model for this relatively new COVID-19 outbreak. According to the modeling prediction the peak of infection should be on the 28 th of March, with almost 42,000 infected people.

","Introduction

The COVID-19 disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly in the first months of the 2020 and the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11 th of March declared a global pandemic [1] . COVID-19 symptoms are often (80%) mild [2] , may appear 2-14 days after exposure (mean incubation period 5-6 days) [2] , and include fever, cough and shortness of breath [3] . However the 13.8% of infected have severe disease and the 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure) [2] . Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks [2] . In the severe and critical disease, the patient admission to intensive care unit (ICU) is necessary and the mechanical ventilation (artificial assistance to support breathing), may be required [4] . This special treatment is the bottle neck of most of the health care systems, which are not prepared to deal with the numbers of patients that the COVID-19 disease could produce. Therefore, measures of containment of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are essential to not overstress the health care systems and to manage the pandemic.The SARS-CoV-2 was firstly reported at the end of 2019 in the Wuhan city (Hubei province), China, reaching epidemic proportion at the end of January 2020. On the 23 rd of January the Chinese government imposed the lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province in an effort to quarantine the center of a COVID-19 outbreak. These drastic measures, with almost 60 million of people in quarantine, were defined ""unprecedented in public health history"" by the WHO. Unfortunately, these measures were not able to stop the spreading of SARS-CoV-2, which caused several outbreaks around the globe.Italy was one of the countries most affected by the SARS-CoV-2, reporting the first positive patient on the 20 th of February 2020, followed by an extensive (and unexpected) epidemic in the north of Italy, especially in the Lombardy region. The Italian government, similarly to the Chinese government, progressively from the 8 th of March to the 11 th of March 2020 imposed the lockdown in the whole nation, introducing the so called ""social distancing"".These drastic measures, also adopted by other EU countries, apart from the health sector, have a dramatic impact on the global economy as well as on the lifestyle habits of millions of people. Epidemiologic descriptions and predictions could help in the understanding of the dynamic of the COVID-19 disease, supporting governments and health authorities in the resources allocation [5] . Most of the models proposed until now to describe the COVID-19 outbreaks, due to the scarcely data available of a still ongoing epidemic, are heuristic models. These models are ""fitting"" equation, exponential [5] or logistic [6] , used to describe the infection data, whose parameters have scarce (or none) physical meaning and their use for prediction, especially at long term, should be avoided. On the contrary compartmental models could constitute the right trad-off between the need of having physical based parameters, the easiness of solution and the scarce presence of data in the evolving epidemic. Typically, the population of interest is subdivided into a small number of compartments based on infection status (e.g. susceptible, infectious or recovered) and the flows between these compartments are described by ordinary differential equations [7] . Aim of this work is to develop a compartmental model (SIRD) to describe first the Chinese COVID-19 epidemic and then, by perturbation of the model parameters, to describe and predict the Italian COVID-19 epidemic.

SIRD model

In compartmental models the population under study is divided into compartments and, with assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics, the movements of people within the compartments can be described. In particular with ""SIRD"" model a four compartments model is indicated, where ""S"" indicates the ""Susceptible"" compartment, ""I"" specifies the ""Infected"" compartment, ""R"" denotes the ""Recovered"" compartment and ""D"" identifies the ""Death"" compartment, as schematized in Figure 1 . Figure 1 . Schematization of the SIRD model. ""S"" indicates the ""Susceptible"" compartment, ""I"" specifies the ""Infected"" compartment, ""R"" denotes the ""Recovered"" compartment and ""D"" identifies the ""Death"" compartment.It is assumed that the total population of reference is constant ( = 60 ), meaning that in the considered time period the rate of birth and death (including the one related to the COVID-19) are equal [8] . This is particularly true for low lethality diseases with very large outbreaks (like a whole nation). It is also assumed that recovered people cannot be re-infected [9] . The ordinary differential equations, with their initial conditions, describing the movements of people from one compartment to the other are reported in the eq. (1-4). = ( = 0) = ! = ""#$# (1)In eq. 1, represents the number of people susceptible to the disease (total minus the already interested ones), is the average number of contacts per person per time [1/day] (multiplied by the probability of disease transmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject). The probability to get infected is proportional to the product of the infected and the susceptible individuals, or better to the fraction of infected individuals ( / ) and the susceptible.In eq. 2, represents the number of infected people, whose initial value is taken from the literature data. Susceptible people get infected by the contact with other infected people (first term RHS), whereas infected people can recover ( ) with the kinetic , which is inversely proportional to the duration of the infection and directly proportional to the probability of recovery.

Actually, the four equations are not independent and the fourth one can be derived from the total balance on the population:Despite very simple SIR (o SIRD) models are based on constant kinetics ( , , ) to describe the epidemic evolution until the depletion of the susceptible people, the measures taken by the governments have had huge impact on the epidemic and therefore on its evolution kinetics.

the average number of contacts per person per time

The kinetic is most of the time used as fitting parameter to describe the epidemiologic data. In this case, with the ""quarantine"" protocol taken by the governments, the number of contacts per person per unit time can dramatically decrease during the epidemic. In this work the kinetic of infection was described with an exponential function:! (actually ! + "" ) is the initial (high) infection kinetics that decreases exponentially thanks to the lockdown measures. "" is the infection kinetic at infinite time, which can be set to be zero due to a long enough period of people isolation. # is the characteristic time of decrease, at = 3 # the kinetic of infection would be decreased of the 90%.

the kinetic of recovery

The kinetic of recovery , in case of a new disease like the COVID-19, is not a constant. The health care system, the medical doctors with all their staff have to learn new therapeutic procedures, get used to treat patients with new symptoms etc. This means that initially the time of recovery will be longer, therefore the kinetic of recovery slower, until a new constant value is reached that should be inversely proportional to the average duration of the infection. In this work was modeled with a logistic function:Where ! is the recovery kinetic at time zero, ! + "" is the recovery kinetic at regime, which is reached after $ days of adaptation.

the kinetic of death

The kinetic of death , especially for new diseases, it is not constant and decreases with time, luckily. This is due to both the adaptation of the pathogen, whose less lethal strains tend to be the most spread, as well as due to the development of new clinical treatments. In this work an exponential decay function was used to describe this evolution:Where ( ! + "" ) is the initial death rate, which decreases substantially (90%) at = 3 % , and reaches a longterm lethality rate "" .

Implementation and optimization

The model was implemented and solved in MATLAB 2019b, with the ode45 solver, based on an explicit Runge-Kutta (4, 5) formula. The optimization of the model parameters to describe the experimental results was performed via the minimization of the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) between the modeling and epidemiologic data. The SSE function was minimized with application of gradient-based method (fmincon) first, followed by a step of minimization with a gradient-free algorithm (pattern-search), followed by a third step of gradientbased method. The use of these three steps was necessary to reach the local minimum, whereas the reaching of a global minimum was proved with the multi-starting technique.

The epidemiologic data

The epidemiologic data were taken from an open source repository operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) [10] . The data regard the total number of cases, the recovered cases and the death cases. The number of infected can be estimated by the difference of the total number of cases minus the recovered and the death cases. As it can be seen the Chinese outbreak has been almost suppressed, with the peak of infection around the 18 th of February. The Italian outbreak is instead still in the fast-growing phase but with the number of deaths already close to the Chinese one. 

Results and discussion

The Chinese outbreak of COVID-19, almost at the end of its development, can be used to understand the dynamic of COVID-19 disease. The model parameters obtained for the description of the Chinese outbreak were perturbated to describe the initial Italian outbreak and to predict its evolution.

Chinese COVID-19 epidemic

The SIRD model results for the Chinese COVID-19 outbreak are reported in Figure 3 . The model parameters (8 parameters) were fitted on the experimental data, obtaining a satisfactorily description of the epidemiologic data published so far. The modeling infection peak is around the 18 th of February, with almost 50,000 people infected, in accordance with the data, predicting the end of the outbreak at the beginning of May.It is interesting to analyzed the value of the obtained modeling parameters, reported in Table 1 The parameters related to the kinetic of death, analogously can be used to obtain information about the average time between the symptoms and the death. Considering the death probability of 4.5% (D/(R+I+D)), the average death time was progressively increased from 5 days in the first week (22-28 th January) to 9 days considering the first 3 week, until reaching two months (meaning a lethality close to zero) at the end of the epidemic. This unexpected result can be explained considering that the treatments were improved as well as considering a parameter not directly accounted in this model: the relation between lethality and patience age [11] . Indeed the ""quarantine"" measures may be particular effective for old people (>60 years) and for people with more comorbidities, who form the group of patients in which the COVID-19 lethality is the highest. 

Italian COVID-19 epidemic

The Italian modeling of the outbreak was performed by perturbation of the Chinese parameters (starting points of the optimization) and adding some constraints on the range of variability of the parameters. The modeling starts from the 26/02/2020, day in which the total cases in Italy were close to the cases in Hubei on the 22/01/2020 (around 400). The population of the Hubei province and Italy is also roughly the same: 60 million.The main Italian lockdown was performed on the 11 th of March, when the cases were already 10590 (against the 438 on the 23 rd of January in China). To account for this delay, the equations for the description of the Italian outbreak were slightly adjusted for ( ) and ( ). Considering a constant rate for the number of contacts per person and also a constant kinetic of death before the date of lockdown (between the 26 th of February and the 11 th of March). After the lockdown both the function decrease exponentially due to the isolation of people (reduction of ) and especially for categories that are at greatest risk of death (reduction of ). From the Chinese model, the characteristic time of infection # , the characteristic time of death % as well as the lethality rate at long time "" were imported and not used as optimizable parameters, considering comparable the measures taken by the Chinese and the Italian government and therefore their impact on the outbreaks.The modeling results obtained are reported in Figure 4 . The epidemiologic data are well described with the optimization of the five adjustable parameters. According to the model prediction the peak is expected between the end of March and the beginning of April (28 th of March precisely) with almost 42,000 infected people. According to the data reported in [2] , if the 6% of patients will require an admission to the intensive care unit, the number of beds in those units should be around 2500 (in accordance with [5] ) which is almost half of the total availability [5] . It is interesting to note that despite the same characteristic time of infection and the delay in the government restrictive measures, the peak is expected before April 11 th (one month after the lockdown). This is because, as it can be seen from the Chinese and Italian infection kinetics, the ""force of infection"" is lower in Italy, which could be explained considering that the mains outbreaks in Italy have been developed in small cities, whereas in the Hubei province the principal outbreak was in the metropolitan city of Wuhan (11 million of people). It has also to be said that the peak is anticipated because of a greater lethality, that removes at higher rate (almost the double with the respect to the Chinese outbreak) patients from the infected compartment. Higher lethality, which is estimated by the model to be around the 11%, reflects also on the total number of death people at the end of the outbreak that, sadly, should be close to 10,000. The D-curve in Figure 4 is of course a sigma-shaped one, and it can be of interest to fit the experimental data by a proper equation, in order to provide easy estimate of proximal behavior. It is disputed if the D-curve has to obey the Logistic behavior (Logistic is the analytic solution for constant-parameter SIS model), or something different (e.g. Gompertz curve). The fit of the model calculation given in Figure 4 is in favor of the use of Gompertz equation as a descriptive tool. The higher lethality could be due to the higher median age of the Italian population (44.3 years) with respect to the Chinese population (37.4 years) [12] . However further studies should be performed to investigate such a high lethality, i.e. in [13] it is suggested that the reasons could be found in the Italian extensive intergenerational contacts, which are supported by a high degree of residential proximity between adult children and their parents. Regarding the recovered people, it has to be said that Italy had an initial higher recovery kinetic, probably due to the experience and treatments inherited from the Chinese case. At the end of the Italian epidemic the model estimates that the 0.136% of the Italian population will be interested by the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Conclusions

COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has spread rapidly and the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11 th of March declared a global pandemic. Despite in most of the cases (80%) COVID-19 presents mild symptoms, in some cases the admission to intensive care units (ICU) and the use of mechanical ventilation are necessary. These types of ""special treatments"" are limited and an uncontrolled COVID-19 epidemic could easily overwhelm any health care system. In order to contain the outbreaks that are being developing in the whole globe, the governments are taking drastic measures, locking down whole nations. The understanding of the dynamic of the epidemic could be useful to take decisions in time, preparing hospitals to deal with the infection peak. The ongoing outbreaks are often described with simple fitting models, i.e. exponential functions functions (and/or sigma-shaped curves such as Logistic or Gompertz, this last being the one to be preferably used to fit the data), however in this work, exploiting the similarity between the almost extinguished Chinese epidemic and the relatively new Italian epidemic, a SIRD compartmental model was developed and used to describe and predict the evolution of both the outbreaks. The advantages of SIRD models with respect to heuristic models reside mainly in the physical-based SIRD parameters, which can give useful insight and/or can be properly chosen on the basis of physical-based assumptions. The present SIRD model was able to describe the Chinese outbreak, obtaining the kinetic of infection, the kinetic of recovery as well as the kinetic of death. Several modeling parameters obtained from the fitting of the Chinese epidemic were used without further modification for the Italian outbreak, considering the similarity of actions taken by the governments. Instead the best fit kinetic of infection in Italy was lower than the Chinese infection, probably because the Italian outbreaks are mainly based in small hospitals/cities, whereas the main Chinese outbreak was in the metropolitan city of Wuhan. The Italian epidemic showed instead a higher death kinetic, causing at the end of infection three times the Chinese death (modeling results). In conclusion the developed SIRD model predicts for the Italian epidemic the infection peak between the end of March and the beginning of April 2020, with almost 42,000 people infected at the same time and a number of death people at the end of the epidemic of about 10,000.All rights reserved.

"Abstract

Model-based epidemiological assessment is useful to support decision-making at the beginning of an emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreak. However, early forecasts are generally unreliable as little information is available in the rst few incidence data points. Here, we show how past Aedestransmitted epidemics help improve these predictions. The approach was applied to the 2015-2017Zika virus epidemics in three islands of the French West Indies, with historical data including other Aedes-transmitted diseases (Chikungunya and Zika) in the same and other locations. Hierarchical models were used to build informative a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and the reporting rates. The accuracy and sharpness of forecasts improved substantially when these a priori distributions were used in models for prediction. For example, early forecasts of nal epidemic size obtained without historical information were 3.3 times too high on average (range: 0.2 to 5.8) with respect to the eventual size, but were far closer (1.1 times the real value on average, range: 0.4 to 1.5) using information on past CHIKV epidemics in the same places. Likewise, the 97.5% upper bound for maximal incidence was 15.3 times (range: 2.0 to 63.1) the actual peak incidence, and became much sharper at 2.4 times (range: 1.3 to 3.9) the actual peak incidence with informative a priori distributions. Improvements were more limited for the date of peak incidence and the total duration of the epidemic. The framework can adapt to all forecasting models at the early stages of emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreaks.Model-based assessments must be done in real time for emerging outbreaks: this was the case in recent years for MERS-CoV in the Middle East [1, 2, 3], Ebola virus in West Africa [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] , chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [11] and Zika virus (ZIKV) [12, 13, 14] in the Americas. These analyses often focused on transmissibility and reproduction numbers rather than on forecasting the future impact of the epidemic. Indeed, forecasting is dicult before the epidemic reaches its peak, all the more when information on natural history, transmissibility and under-reporting is limited [15] . Yet, it is precisely at the beginning of an outbreak that forecasts would help public health authorities decide on the best strategies for control or mitigation.Several methods have been used to make epidemic predictions, including exponential growth models [5, 16] , sigmoid-based extrapolations [17] , SIR-type models [18] and more realistic model 1 .

accounting for spatial and population structure [19] . But in addition to specifying a model, selecting good parameter values is also essential to obtain good predictions. In models for directly transmitted diseases, this can come from realistic demographic and behavioral characteristics, for example the contact frequency between individuals [20] , mobility patterns [21, 22, 23, 24] , and from clinical and epidemiological characteristics like the duration of the serial interval [25] . Such information is less easily available and more limited for mosquito-transmitted diseases [26] . However, outbreaks of the same disease or diseases with similar routes of transmission may have occurred in the same or similar locations, so that relevant information may be recovered from the analysis of past outbreaks.Here, we show that past outbreaks of Aedes-transmitted diseases can substantially improve the epidemiological assessment of diseases transmitted by the same vector from early surveillance data.We introduce a hierarchical statistical model to analyze and extract information from historical data and obtain a priori distributions for required epidemiological parameters [27] . The method is [28] . Cases of ZIKV infection were dened as a rash with or without fever and at least two signs among conjunctivitis, arthralgia or edema"". We obtained numbers of suspected cases by week for each island, extrapolated from the number of active sentinel sites (dataset D1). In the West Indies, local health authorities described the situation as epidemic when incidence was larger than 1 per 2,000 population per week (i.e. 200 cases in Guadeloupe and Martinique [29] , and 20 cases in Saint-Martin). Following this description, we dened the S(-tart) of the epidemic as the rst week above this threshold, the P (-eak) date when incidence was the highest, and the E(-nd) of the epidemic as the third consecutive week below the threshold (to ascertain the downwards trend). The time interval from S to E"" corresponds to the period of high epidemic activity.We then analyzed historical data on the spread of emerging Aedes -transmitted diseases in similar locations. CHIKV epidemics occured in the same three islands during 2013-2015. Both diseases were transmitted by the same vector (Aedes aegypti ), circulated in the same immunologically naive populations within a period of two years, had the same kind of clinical signs (i.e., fever, rash and arthralgia) and were reported by the same surveillance system. Surveillance data on CHIKV epidemics in the French West Indies was available from local health authorities (dataset D2) [30] .Finally, we also selected the ZIKV and CHIKV epidemics that occured in six islands or archipelagoes of French Polynesia between 2013 and 2017, as they provided information on the dierences between the two diseases. Surveillance data regarding the outbreaks in French Polynesia (dataset D3) was collected following similar methods as in the French West Indies [31, 32] The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Epidemic model

The ZIKV outbreaks in Guadeloupe, Martinique and Saint-Martin were modelled separately using a dynamic discrete-time SIR model within a Bayesian framework. Briey, the two main components of the model were: (i) a mechanistic reconstruction of the distribution of the serial interval of the disease (the time interval between disease onset in a primary case and a secondary case) that allows bypassing vector compartments; (ii) a transmission model for the generation of observed secondary cases in the human host. The generation time distribution was reconstructed by estimating the durations of each part of the infection cycle using disease-and mosquito-specic data from the literature, and assuming a xed local temperature of 28 • C, as described in more detail in the supplementary appendix. This led to gamma distributions with mean 2.5 weeks (standard deviation: 0.7) for ZIKV and with mean 1.6 weeks (sd: 0.6) for CHIKV.Then, we linked weekly observed incidence O t,X to past incidence with:where subscript X refers to disease (X = C for CHIKV or X = Z for ZIKV), R 0,X is the basic reproduction number, N the population size, and S t,X = N − t−1 k=0 O k,X /ρ X the number of individuals susceptible to infection at time t where ρ X is the reporting rate. The term 5 n=1 w t,X,n O t−n accounts for exposure to infection at time t, where w k is the discretized serial interval distribution. The variance is computed as the mean divided by the overdispersion parameter φ X . The model was implemented in Stan version 2.15.1 R version 3.4.0 [33, 34, 35] . More details regarding the epidemic model and the Stan code are available in the supplementary appendix.

Informative and non-informative prior distributions

To analyze Zika epidemics, the reproduction ratio R 0,Z , the reporting rate ρ Z and the overdispersion parameter φ Z must be estimated. For φ Z , we used a non-informative prior in all cases [36] . For R 0,Z and ρ Z , we designed three dierent prior distributions, labelled as non-informative (NI), regional (R), or local (L) and described below.The NI prior distributions expressed vague characteristics of the parameters: R 0,Z will be positive and likely not greater than 20; and ρ Z will range between 0 and 1.The R and L priors were derived from the analysis of datasets D2 and D3 in three steps. We rst analysed jointly the three CHIKV epidemics in dataset D2 using model 1, introducing a two-level hierarchical structure for the island-specic parameters: an island-specic reproduction number R 0,C,i sampled from a top-level regional distribution N (µ R 0 ,C , σ R 0 ,C ), and similarly logit(ρ C,i ) ∼ N (µ ρ C , σ ρ C ) for the logit of the reporting rate. We obtained the posterior distributions of these parameters for the CHIKV outbreaks in each island π(R 0,C,i , ρ C,i |D2), as well as that of the hyperparameters π(µ R 0 ,C , σ R 0 ,C , µ ρ,C , σ ρ,C |D2).We then analysed dataset D3 using the same hierarchical structure as above and introducing relative transmissibility and reporting of ZIKV with respect to CHIKV as R 0,Z = β R 0 R 0,C and ρ Z = β ρ ρ C . We thus used French Polynesia data to estimate the relative transmissibility π(β R 0 |D3) and the relative reporting rate π(β ρ |D3) of ZIKV with respect to CHIKV in the French West Indies.In a third step, these posterior distributions were combined to obtain the R and L prior probability distributions as described in Table 1 .The R and L priors diered in how much island-specic information they contained, the R priors being altogether less informative than the L priors. More precisely, the L priors used the bottom level in the hierarchical description, actually combining island-specic distributions for transmission 3 .

Fitting and predicting ZIKV epidemics

We tted model 1 to ZIKV data separately in Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Martin using the K rst weeks of data (varying K from 5 to the number of weeks in the epidemic) and each a priori distribution (NI, R or L), to obtain posterior distributions for parameters R 0,Z , ρ Z and φ Z for every combination of island, K and choice of prior.Then, using each set of posterior distributions, the epidemics were simulated forward from week K + 1 for two years using a stochastic version of the model described in equation 1. We used 16, 000 replicates to compute the predictive distribution of the weekly number of future incident cases and a trajectory-wise 95% prediction band [37] . Using these simulated trajectories, we also computed the predictive distributions of four indicators of operational interest, for direct comparison with observed values:• the nal epidemic size, dened as the average total incidence across all simulated trajectories;• the peak incidence, dened as the maximal value of the upper bound of the trajectory-wise 95% prediction band, as it corresponds to the capacity needed to ensure continuity of care [38] ;• the date of peak incidence, dened as the average date of peak incidence across all trajectories;• the epidemic duration, dened as the average duration between dates S and E"" across all trajectories.The predictive distributions were compared using two measures of forecasting quality: (i) accuracy, i.e. the root-mean-square dierence between predicted and observed values, and (ii) sharpness,

ZIKV epidemics in the French West Indies

The timecourse of the ZIKV epidemics in Guadeloupe, Martinique and Saint-Martin between December, 2015 and February, 2017 diered markedly: the initial growth was early and sudden in Martinique, while it was delayed in Guadeloupe and Saint-Martin, starting only after four months of low-level transmission (Fig. 1) . The epidemic showed a sharp peak in Guadeloupe, reaching a maximal weekly incidence of 6.9 cases per 1,000 inhabitants 9 weeks after the start of the period of high epidemic activity. In Martinique and Saint-Martin, weekly incidence reached a maximum of 4.8 cases per 1,000 inhabitants after a period of 10 and 21 weeks, respectively. Conversely, the period of high epidemic activity was longer in Martinique and Saint-Martin (37 and 48 weeks, respectively), than in Guadeloupe (27 weeks). In the end, a total of about 37,000 cases were observed in Martinique (97 cases per 1,000 inhabitants), more than in Saint-Martin (90 cases per 1,000 inhabitants) and Guadeloupe (77 cases per 1,000 inhabitants).

The a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and reporting rates for the ZIKV epidemics in the French West Indies dening the NI, R or L approaches are shown in Fig. 2 .The R priors were wide, with 95% credible intervals between 0.5 and 2.5 for R 0,Z and between 0 and 0.30 for ρ Z . On the contrary, the more specic L priors on R 0,Z were highly concentrated around 1.5 in Guadeloupe and 1.3 in Martinique, and ranged between 1.0 and 1.8 in Saint-Martin. Likewise, the island-specic priors on ρ Z carried more information that their regional counterpart, peaking around 0.19 in Guadeloupe, and covering wider intervals in Martinique (0.20-0.40) and Saint-Martin non-informative, regional and island-specic.Epidemiological parameters and predictive distribution of future incidence The posterior distributions of the parameters built up dierently as data accrued for R 0,Z and ρ Z . For all three choices of prior distributions, the posterior distributions of R 0,Z quickly overlaid after a few points of incidence data were observed (Fig. 5A) . In sharp contrast, the posterior distributions of ρ Z could remain aected by the choice of prior distributions (Fig. 5B) . In Martinique and Saint-Martin, ρ Z remained essentially unidentied with the NI priors for the entire duration of the epidemic, with 95% credible intervals ranging approximately from 20 to 80%, even though the posterior mean was close to the estimates obtained with the more informative priors (around 25% at the end). Informative priors allowed for a more precise estimation of ρ Z , and this remained the 6 .

In Guadeloupe, all posterior distributions for ρ Z were similar after the peak, irrespective of the choice of priors.

Operational indicators

The forecasts of the four indicators of operational interest produced before peak incidence were contrasted. With NI priors, forecasts of total epidemic size overestimated the nal counts by on average 3.3 times (range: 0.2 to 5.8) (Fig. 6A) Similarly, forecasts of maximal weekly (observed) incidence produced before date P "" were generally too large when using NI priors, on average 15.3 times higher than the actual maximal weekly incidence observed thereafter (range: 2.0 to 63.1) and with large uctuations (Fig. 6B ). Using informative prior distributions improved the forecasts, reducing the maximum predicted incidence to 7.5 times higher (range: 3.0 to 25.5) with the R priors and 2.4 times higher (range: 1.3 to 3.9) with the L priors. In all cases, forecasts of maximal incidence were never smaller than actual incidence.Forecasting the dates of interest in the epidemics showed mixed results, with less dierences depending on the choice of priors. The forecasts of the date of peak incidence were too late by on average 1.0 month (range: -3.4 to +3.9) using the NI priors, with large variations (Fig. 6C) . Forecasts were only slightly better with the R priors (+0.7 months, range: -2.1 to +2.8) and the L priors (+0.9 months, range: -1.1 to +3.2), but sharper. Better forecasts were obtained for Martinique than for the other islands.The forecasts of the total duration of the period of high epidemic activity were overestimated by a factor 1.3 (range: 0.1 to 2.6) with NI priors, again with high variability from week to week (Fig. 6D) . Informative priors brought a small improvement, in particular regarding the stability of the forecasts over time, overestimating the actual duration by a factor 1.2 (range: 0.7 to 2.0) with R priors and by a factor 1.1 (range: 0.9 to 1.7) with L priors. 

Discussion

Obtaining reliable model-based forecasts in real time at the beginning of an epidemic is a dicult endeavour. It is however precisely during these periods that forecasts may have the most impact to guide interventions. Here, we compared several approaches to provide forecasts for ZIKV epidemics from an early point in a retrospective analysis of the outbreaks that occurred in the French West Indies in 2015-2017. We found that the accuracy and sharpness of the forecasts before peak incidence were substantially improved when a priori information based on historical data on past epidemics was used.The three ZIKV outbreaks in the French West Indies provided an ideal situation to look for ways to improve prediction of Aedes-transmitted diseases using historical data. Indeed, CHIKV outbreaks had been observed in the same locations about two years before ZIKV, CHIKV is also transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, and both viruses spread in a region where the populations were immunologically naive at rst. Furthermore, all epidemics were observed by the same routinely operating GP-based surveillance networks, and the three locations benet from a mature public health system, with easy access to medical consultation and individual means of protection. Last, pest control is done in routine, with additional intervention showing limited ecacy in this context [40, 41] . This motivated our decision to use constant parameters for transmsission and reporting over time in the modelling.Having established the many similarities between ZIKV and CHIKV epidemics regarding transmission and reporting, we assumed that information could be transported (as dened in [42] ) between diseases and between places. Bayesian approaches allow such transportation using informative a priori distributions on model parameters [27] . Historical data on CHIKV epidemics was therefore used 9 . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/300954 doi: bioRxiv preprint to build informative a priori distributions on the two key parameters R 0,Z and ρ Z . Hierarchical models are particularly adapted to this task, as they naturally pool information among several past epidemics and capture both within-and between-location variability [43] . We used separate hierarchical models to obtain information about (i) transmissibility and reporting during CHIKV outbreaks in the French West Indies and (ii) relative transmissibility and reporting between ZIKV and CHIKV in French Polynesia, rather than from a global joint model (as in [44] ). This choice was made to show that prior information can be combined from separate sources in a modular way. We nally considered two versions of informative priors to capture dierent degrees of knowledge. The (L)ocal priors corresponded with estimates for the previous CHIKV epidemic in the same island, therefore including island-specic epidemic drivers, such as population structure and distribution, socio-economic circumstances and environmental conditions. On the other hand, the (R)egional priors encompassed the diversity of past observations within the region, making priors valid for a typical island of the West Indies, especially when no other epidemic has been observed previously.Analyses conducted at the early stage of an epidemic using non-informative a priori distributions as is often done led to poor forecasts before the peak of incidence was reached, an observation already made in other studies [45] . Indeed, early forecasts of epidemic size were largely o-target and unstable, varying between 0.2 and 5.8 times the eventually observed total incidence. Worst case projections on maximal incidence were very imprecise, ranging between 2 and 63 times the eventually reached maximal weekly incidence. Using historical data led to a substantial increase of the quality of these forecasts from the very early stages of the epidemics. Using local priors, the ratio between forecasts and reality ranged between 0.4 and 1.5 for epidemic size and between 1.3 and 3.9 for maximal incidence. The less specic regional priors increased accuracy and sharpness as well, though to a lesser extent. However, the date of peak incidence and the date of the end of the period of high epidemic activity were only slightly improved by integrating historical data.The posterior distributions of all forecasted quantities changed as more data was included (Fig.   4 ). The posterior estimates of R 0,Z were quickly similar and in good agreement with prior information. On the contrary, the reporting rate ρ Z remained essentially unidentiable until after the incidence peak in Guadeloupe, and to the end of the outbreak in Martinique and Saint-Martin. This suggests that prior information is essentially required for the reporting rate, a dicult to estimate quantity as already noted [15] . Sensitivity analysis support this result. Indeed, providing informative prior on ρ Z only leads to similar results as providing it for both ρ Z and R 0,Z (supplementary appendix).Predicting the future course of epidemics from an early point is increasingly seen as a problem of interest [46, 9, 8] , and forecasting challenges have been set up for inuenza [47] , for Ebola [45] and for chikungunya [48] . Comparing and systematically evaluating models' forecasting performances is still at the beginning. As of now, comparisons targeted the merits of dierent models including exponential growth models, sigmoid models, or mechanistic epidemic models [45] . Our work provides a complementary approach where information from past epidemics is combined using hierarchical models to inform on parameter ranges, thus increasing the reliability of early forecasts. It was applied here to a dynamic discrete-time SIR model that for its parsimony is well-adapted to real-time forecasting. Complex mechanistic models can provide a more realistic description of the epidemic, accounting, for instance, for heterogenous spatial distribution of individuals and mobility coupling a relevant ingredient for describing epidemics in more extended spatial areas , or vector population dynamics and its mixing with humans. Our framework could in principle be adapted to these more sophisticated models.Only recently have hierarchical models been used for modelling multiple epidemics, for instance with the joint analysis of six smallpox epidemics [49] , for transmissibility and duration of carriage in the analysis of multistrain pneumococcus carriage [50] , or for forecasting seasonal inuenza [51] .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/300954 doi: bioRxiv preprintOther modelling papers specically attempted to take advantage of the similarities between dierent Aedes-transmitted diseases, e.g., by estimating the risk of acquiring chikungunya from the prevalence of dengue [52] or by assesssing the spatio-temporal coherence of chikungunya, Zika and dengue [53] .Also, using informative priors to make up for the lack of information during the early stages of an epidemic has been done before. For instance, a priori information from the ZIKV epidemics in French Polynesia has been used to support the early forecasts of health-care requirements for the ZIKV epidemic in Martinique [38] . In this case, however, authors concluded that a prior built from an epidemic in a dierent location resulted in inaccurate predictions at the early stage. We found a similar result in a sensitivity analysis: the direct use of information from ZIKV in French Polynesia, or alternatively the direct use of information from CHIKV in the French West Indies, without adjusting for ZIKV, leads to poor overall forecasting quality compared to the L prior considered here (supplementary appendix).This shows that the choice of appropriate historical data is the cornerstone of any such attempt.Yet little is known regarding the comparative epidemiology of diseases in the same or similar places and on the condition where transportability can be assumed. For inuenza, it has been reported that the reproduction ratios in two successive u pandemics (1889 and 1918) showed substantial correlation (r = 0.62) in the same US cities, even years apart [54] . For Aedes -transmitted diseases, comparisons of ZIKV and dengue virus outbreaks [55] and of ZIKV with CHIKV outbreaks [44] in the same locations have highlighted similarities in the epidemic dynamics. In any case, careful consideration of all the factors that may inuence transmission and reporting is needed. For example, contrary to CHIKV, some cases of sexual transmission have been reported for ZIKV [56, 57] . Yet, no epidemics were seen in locations without enough Aedes mosquitoes, as for example in metropolitan France, despite the introductions of several hundreds ZIKV infected cases [58] . This justies the use of CHIKV epidemic data to provide prior information on ZIKV in the epidemic context considered here. More generally, documenting, analyzing and comparing more systematically past epidemics [59] is necessary to provide the data required to derive prior information. In particular, informed with epidemiological records of the recent CHIKV and ZIKV epidemics, our approach could be applied to potential future emergences of other Aedes -transmitted diseases such as Mayaro virus [60] , Ross River virus [61] or Usutu virus [62] once transportability is deemed plausible.

"Abstract

The outbreak of COVID-19 become enormous threat to human beings, showing unclear virus mutation during dissemination. We found, in our 788 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the decreased rate of severe/critical type, increased liver/kidney damage and prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity, when compared with Wuhan.To investigate underlining mechanisms, we isolated one strain of SARS-CoV-2 (ZJ01) in mild COVID-19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 has both T at those sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and electrostatic distribution of S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19subtypes. : medRxiv preprint mutation near FCS changed protein structure conformation and surface electrostatic potential, which further influenced its binding capacity with Furin.

","Introduction

The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its infected Disease in Wuhan since the end of 2019 and quickly spreading over the whole country, has put severe threat on public health and economic retardation to China 1, 2 .Through quick response and drastic measures even including quarantining Wuhan city on Jan 23, 2020, the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 was effectively controlled.Nevertheless, its ensuing global sporadic appearance 3, 4 and quick dissemination in Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy raised world alert of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics 5, 6, 7 .Therefore, it is urgent to continuingly illustrate the clinical and virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 during its dissemination.An important and common feature of virus is that its increased transmissibility usually accompanies with decreased virulence, which also holds true for SARS-CoV-2 and is reflected in the disease trajectory. On one hand, COVID-19 was more severe in Wuhan at its early stage, reaching approximately 32% of severe/critical types and 11% of fatality 8, 9 . In contrast, data out of Wuhan showed more mild type of COVID-19, as presented in Zhejiang province 10 and nationwide 11 .On the other hand, its transmissibility was increased from varied basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2 12 and 2.68 6 based on Wuhan data to that of 3.77 13 in national level. Furthermore, the observation of similar viral load between COVID-19 patients with and without symptoms revealed its capacity of occult transmission 14 .It is well acknowledged that change in the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 roots from virological change of SARS-CoV-2, in which its spike (S) surface envelope protein plays an important role 15 . Generally, its surface unit (S1) is responsible for host entry by binding to cell receptor while its transmembrane unit (S2) takes charge of the fusion of viral and cellular membranes 16 . Therefore, it is of great value to focus on the sequence mutation and conformation change in S protein for SARS-CoV-2 evolution in a finely established model, aiming to explain the related change of COVID-19.In this study, we identified 9.9% severe/critical type in 788 confirmed COVID-19 patients of Zhejiang province and median 11 days of positive nuclear acid in 104 patients from our hospital, showing the tendency of COVID-19 progression towards mild but more infective direction. Based on these clinical findings, we performed in-depth bioinformatics analysis by comparing the virological features of previously reported 52 strains of SARS-CoV-2, including Bat coronavirus, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and ZJ01 (SARS-CoV-2 we firstly reported in one patient with mild COVID-19 in Zhejiang province). We demonstarated that the specific mutation of ZJ01 may represent a de novo evolution trend of SARS-CoV-2, which might be related with Furin. Besides, the establishment of a novel SARS-CoV-2 categorization system may facilitate our understanding of virus evolution and its influence on disease severity and progression.

Data sources and ethics

A retrospective study investigating the epidemiological, clinical and virological features of COVID-19 in designated hospitals of Zhejiang province between Jan 17 and Feb 7, 2020 was performed, followed by calculating the period of positive nuclear acid of COVID-19 in our hospital. All patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance 17 . and the preliminary data were reported to the authority of Zhejiang province. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University (NO. IIT20200005C). Written informed consent was waived by the ethics commission of the designated hospital, as this study was carried out for emerging infectious disease and to be part of a continuing public health outbreak investigation under national authorization. The subtypes of COVID-19 were categorized into mild, severe and critical, as recently reported 11 . The period of positive nuclear acid is defined as the date of confirmed nuclear acid positivity minus the date of confirmed nuclear acid negativity.

Procedure and virus strain collection

SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed from samples of throat-swab and sputum in our hospital and local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) of Zhejiang province, by real-time RT-PCR 8 . All patients received chest x-rays or CT scan on admission, with excluding other respiratory viruses such as influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H7N9), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The epidemiological, anthropometrical, clinical and laboratory data were collected on admission, with specific attention paid to the period between symptom onset and outpatient visiting/PCR confirmation/hospital admission. One strain of SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from the sputum of COVID-19 patient with mild type in our hospital, followed by whole genome sequencing with previously reported method 18 .

Sequence data collection and alignment of SARS-CoV-2

Current available coronavirus sequences (n=85) were collectively achieved from NCBI viral genome database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, n=65), Genome Warehouse (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh/, n=12), CNGBdb (https://db.cngb.org/, n=3) and NMDC (http://nmdc.cn/#/coronavirus, n=6). Sequence of ZJ01 (BataCov/Zheji ang/ZJ01/2019) was provided according to our sequencing result. The 52 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were collected from China (n = 30), Japan (n = 5), Nepal (n = 1), South Korea (n = 1), Australia (n =1), Finland (n=1) and United States of America (n = 13).

Further similarity analysis indicated that the main difference among various coronaviruses located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region of S1. Intriguingly, the differences between ZJ01 and other members of SARS-CoV-2 mainly resided in in the S1/S2 and S2 (Fig 2B) . We proposed a novel categorization system for SARS-CoV-2, and defined type C for 8824C, type T for 8824T and type TT for ZJ01 as a special case, respectively. According to this system, we further categorized 54 strains of SARS-CoV-2-related virus (Fig 3C) . We found 83.3% and 95.7% T type in China (n=30) and Wuhan (n=23); 60% and 100% C type in Japan (n=5) and Tokyo (n=3); 53.8% C type in the USA (n=13), 83.3% T type in California (n=6) and 100% C type in Washington D.C (n=3). Intriguingly, of two cases from Illinois, one was T type and the other was named as Y type for Y in both nucleotide positions 8824 and 28247 , indicating the possibility of co-infection with both T and C types.

Though Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 shared same amino acid sequence in F1 site, the mutation (Glu702 to Lys702) nearby F1 site of ZJ01 may still change its protein structure conformation and result in further outward extension by 11.6 Å. Furthermore, RaTG13, Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 owned high degree of consistency in F2 site. The F2 site of GZ02 was deeply buried in the inner place of S protein, that was the biggest difference of SARS-CoV-2 whose F2 site was on the surface of S protein. Finally, RaTG13, Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 showed high similarity in F3 site that was missing in GZ02.Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS)analysis revealed that furin was a protease with negative charge. Its substrate binding site (191-192, 253-258, 292-295) was covered with a large number of negative charges (Fig 6) .

Since ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression were reported recently 30 , we also examined TMPRSS2 expression levels in these tissues.In the scRNA-seq datasets, ACE2, FURIN and TMPRSS2 showed higher expression levels in liver or colon than in lung (Fig. 7E) . Consistently with previously report 31 , ACE2 was mainly expressed in alveolar type 2 cells in lung ( Fig. 7D-E) . ACE2 was highly expressed in liver cholangiocytes, liver hepatocytes, colon colonocytes and colon CT colonocytes compared with other liver or colon cell types respectively. This expression pattern was the same as TMPRSS2, but TMPRSS2 had a higher expression level in each cell type. In contrast, FURIN was expressed in all cells types of three tissues, but had little co-expression with ACE2..

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 788 enrolled COVID-19 patients and ZJ01 patient

As shown in Table 1 , 51.65% of the 788 enrolled patients were male, with low rate of smoking (6.85%). The top three co-existing conditions were hypertension (15.99%), diabetes (7.23%) and chronic liver disease (3.93%). The median period from illness onset to outpatient visiting, PCR confirmation and hospital admission were 2, 4 and 3 days, respectively. The most common symptoms were fever (80.71%) and cough (64.21%) while the highest rate of CT/X-ray manifestation was bilateral pneumonia (37.56%). The rates of mild, sever and critical types of COVID-19 were 90.1%, 7.74% and 2.16%, respectively. The ZJ01 patient is male, 30y, and had neither smoking history nor any co-existing condition. He visited outpatient clinics 1 day after symptom onset and was admitted in hospital confirming with COVID-19 in the same day by PCR test. He had no exposure history to Wuhan and none of his family members was reported to be virus positive till now. Consistent with other COVID-19 patients, he had the symptoms of fever, cough and sputum production, with CT image showing bilateral pneumonia. This .

SARS-CoV-2

The whole sequence of ZJ01 was deposited in Appendix. Sequence alignment analysis suggested that ZJ01 had 38 mutation sites compared with other SARS-CoV-2 family members (Fig 2A) , in which 35 mutations were unique to ZJ01, including 7 deletions, 4 insertions and 24 substitutions. For the rest 3 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Evolutionary divergence in SARS-CoV-2 strongly correlated with Furin protein

There were 3 potential furin cleavage site (FCS) on S protein, where F1, F2 and F3 separately located in S1/S2, S2 and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 ( Fig   4A) . Further comparative alignment analysis on GZ02 (SARS viral strain), Wuhan-Hu-1 (the earliest sequenced SARS-CoV-2), RaTG13, HKU9-1 (the potential ancestor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 (HKU-1 and OC43) showed that FCS exhibited a clear sequence and rule in coronavirus evolution ( Fig 4B) . In detail, there was no FCS in HKU9-1, but one potential FCS in F2 locus of GZ02 (Furin score 0.366) showed effective furin binding capacity 28 .For RaTG13, F2 locus was slightly changed (Furin score 0.333) and a novel FCS was formed in F1 locus (Furin score 0.279). Though the changes in these two sites were inherited in SARS-CoV-2, there still existed huge differences in F1 site between RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2.Strikingly, we found an additional PRRA sequence in the F1 site of SARS-CoV-2 when compared with RaTG13, forming a strong and reliable FCS (Furin score 0.62). Though the source of insertion was unknown, the PRRA sequence was common in Avian Influenza virus 29 . We deduced that its source might inherit from HKU1 and OC43, which had effective FCS in F1 site (Furin score 0.878 and 0.744) and respective amino acid of SSRRKRR and TKRRSRR, with high similarity of NSPRRAR in SARS-CoV-2. HKU1 and CO43 could cause human upper respiratory tract infection but the symptom was milder than SARS and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reckoned that the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 may exchange gene with HKU1 or OC43 to obtain FCS in F1 site during evolution to human transmission (Fig 4C) . ZJ01 had Glu702 to Lys702 substitution at the site 18 th amino acid behind F1 site, and deletion (Ala771 to -) at the site 37 th amino acid ahead of F2 site. These mutations may influence the tertiary and quaternary structure of S protein and finally change the Furin binding capacity. F1-3 sites were conservative in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS (Fig 4D) , indicating the importance of mutation in these sites.

Protein structure analyses implied the mutation in F1 and F2 related area of ZJ01 may influence its binding capacity with Furin protein

Homology modeling clearly revealed the position of F1-3 sites in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig 5A) . Briefly, F1-3 all located on the surface of S protein and protruded outward, exhibiting high potential as substrate binding sites. F1 located on the transition area of S1 and S2 (S1/S2) with obvious outward protrusion, F2 located on the mid-lower position of S2, while F3 located on the top of S1-NTD.Further homology modeling of the S protein of GZ02, RaTG13, Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 showed big differences in protein structure conformation of F1 locus. From SARS, RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2, the F1 site showed the tendency of outward .

Higher expression of Furin than ACE2 in different organs at single cell level

The protein and RNA expression level of ACE2 and Furin in human major tissues were explored in The Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/). We found that ACE2 was predominantly expressed in small intestine, duodenum, colon, kidney and testis, while was relatively lowly expressed in lung (Fig. 7A) . Furin was expressed in most tissues and organs of the human body, and exhibited highest expression levels of RNA in salivary gland, placenta, liver, pancreas and bone marrow (Fig. 7B) . Of note, Furin had extremely low protein expression level in lung compared with other tissues. and RaTG13 reveals the existence of great difference in electrostatic potential, which may be caused by protein structure change in F1-3 and nearby locus. The mutation in F1-2 sites of ZJ01 may cause its differed binding capacity with Furin, when compared with Wuhan-Hu-1.To further explore the correlation between ACE2 and FURIN expression, we reanalyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in lung, liver, colon as .

Discussion

The outbreak of COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading over the recent 2 months, causing enormous damage to China. With nationwide dissemination, its epidemiological and clinical features have changed. Accumulating evidences indicate the appearance of several unique characteristics distinct from Wuhan 8, 9, 32 , including higher rate of mild type, lower rate of severe/critical type and mortality and longer period of nuclear acid positivity 10, 11, 27, 33 . Moreover, the increased transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 has been gradually unmasked, from previous recognition of respiratory transmission to through feces 34 and even tears and conjunctival secretions 35 All these data indicate the possibility of virus evolution during its spreading, towards the direction of decreased severity but increased transmissibility.However, according to recently published virus sequencing results 18 Through analysis on 788 COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang province, we found that there existed mild and severe types of SARS-CoV-2. Though we didn't currently have evidence to prove whether patients with mild COVID-19 are directly caused by virus mutation or other factors, we indeed found the significant difference between ZJ01 and other members of SARS-CoV-2. ZJ01 had relative high number of 37 mutations and its RSCU was closer to humans than most members of SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, ZJ01 was the only TT type of total 54 strains in our C/T categorization system. Though the sequence of ZJ01 was still close to Wuhan-Hu-1 (the earliest identified SARS-CoV-2) and its mutations were not sufficient to reach the threshold of forming an independent subtype, our evidence indicated ZJ01 may represent a specific evolution direction of SARS-CoV-2.In this study, we first developed the C/T categorization system of SARS-CoV-2, which revealed the occurrence of possibly inheritable mutation at the very early stage of its evolution and the potential of continuing C/T subtype formation. The TT type of ZJ01 was unique in our system. Though a similar categorization system has been recently proposed 36 , they did not report such TT type in their 120 strains of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the C/T pattern could also be used to trace the route of virus infection and evolution. For instance, we found 8 strains of T type with RaTG13 and MP789 both had 8824C/28247T/29198T, we could speculate that these 8 strains of 29198T appeared earlier than strains of 29198C. Using this method, we reckoned that the earliest strains of SARS-CoV-2 was one patient admitted in Shenzhen hospital on 2020-1-10, whose entire type was 8824C/28247T/29198T/2682C/3812C/9606C/11125G/15667T/29808G. Besides, the earliest strain in the USA was from Phoenix, Arizona on 2020-1-26, whose entire type was 8824C/28247T/29198T/2682C/3812C/9606T/11125G/15667C/ 29808G. Patients with these two earliest strains both had exposure history to Wuhan. Therefore, we surmised that the origin of SARS-CoV-9 was still in Wuhan, but the earliest virus was still vague due to lack of enough samples (Supplementary Figure 1) .Furin is well recognized as an important serine protease, which has a minimum enzyme restriction site of Arg(R)-X-X-Arg (R) and plays an essential role in influenza infection. The binding capacity change of Furin in Avian Influenza may influence its pathogenicity 37 . Though Furin is not the most common protease in coronavirus, previous studies indicated its pivotal roles in SARS and MERS 28, 38 .RaTG13 was the strain closest to SARS-CoV-2 with 96% sequence similarity 39 .However, SRAS-CoV-2 had PRRA insertion in 690 amino acid site of S protein, with high conservation 40 . This insertion may become critical point for the host of RaTG13 turning from animal to human. Through sequence alignment, we found this inserted sequence may arise from the translocation between human coronavirus HKU1 and OC43 (Figure 4 )..

However, whether F3 site really exists and what is the function need further investigation. Furthermore, the target cell binding site of HKU1 and OC43 was on their S A segment of S protein while its corresponding site in SARS-CoV-2 was NTD. Therefore, except for the potential interaction in F1 site, there also exists the possibility of interaction in NTD segment between SARS-CoV-2 and HKU1/OC43. Viruses frequently undergo mutation and adjust its RSCU under evolutionary selection pressure to adapt to the host, facilitating better replication and dissemination 41 . The choice of Furin cleavage site might be an outstanding marker for coronavirus evolution. Meanwhile, we found that the mutation in ZJ01 may cause binding force change of FCS. All these data indicate that Furin might play a pivotal role in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The evolution trends of increasing FCS in SARS-CoV-2 we found in this study are more prone to influenza-like clinical manifestations such as human HKU1 and OC43 42 .Single cell sequencing analysis showed that Furin had higher expression level and wider organ distribution than ACE2, especially in salivary gland, lachrymal gland, colon, liver and kidney. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might evolve to utilize this specific feature by increasing FCS to become more infectious on multi-organ levels. Our hypothesis was in consistent with changed clinical characteristics of COVID-19 from published data and our observation, including detection of virus in feces 34 and conjunctival secretions 35 , decreased severity/fatality, increased liver/kidney damage and symptoms of gastrointestinal tract, increased transmissibility and prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity. Since ACE2 expression was quite low in the whole body including lung, we speculated that, on one hand, it might be the inflammatory reaction whereas not the viral road itself triggering severe respiratory damage; on the other hand, the utilization of Furin may help scatter virus attack from lung to other organs, contributing to the phenomenon of decreased severity but increased liver/kidney dysfunction. Nevertheless, all these speculations warrant further investigations.To sum up, ZJ01 isolated form mild COVID-19 patient of Zhejiang province represents a potential branch in virus evolution. SARS-CoV-2 may adopt a similar mechanism by depending on Furin for invasion as HJU1 and OC43. Such potential evolution direction may promote the appearance of mild subtype of COVID-19.

"Abstract

Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China began in December 2019. Studies on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were less based on pediatric patients. This study aimed to reveal the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children. Method: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical symptoms, laboratory results, chest CT, and treatment of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19(ie, with samples that were positive for 2019 novel coronavirus[2019-nCoV]) who were admitted to Result: Nine patients had no obvious clinical symptom. 11 patients developed fever. Other symptoms, including cough(in eleven of seventeen patients), rhinorrhea(in two), diarrhea(in two), vomiting(in two), were also observed. A small minority of patients had lymphocytopenia. Alanine transaminase or transaminase increased in three cases. According to chest CT scan, 11 patients showed unilateral pneumonia, 8 patients had no pulmonary infiltration. No serious complications such as acute respiratory syndrome and acute lung injury occurred in all patients. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children were different from adult. The overall condition of children were mild and have a good prognosis.

","BACKGROUND

Pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei, China and then the epidemic broke out. It was defined by the World Health Organization as ""an international public health emergency of public concern"" [1, 2] . Recently, many researches in the lancet reported the epidemiological, clinical symptoms, laboratory data, imaging features, treatment methods and clinical outcomes of non-pregnant adults and pregnant women infected with 2019-nCOV [3, 4] . However, the clinical characteristics of children have not been well disclosed, and whether there are differences in treatment methods has not been determined. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 28 children with COVID-19 tested positive for 2019-nCOV by use of RT-PCR on samples.

Patient information

We reviewed 26 cases of children(>1 year old and <14 years old) in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 8, 2020 . Diagnosis of

COVID-19 was based on the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control

Program(6th edition) issued by the National Health and Health Committee of China [5] .The study was approved by the instututional of research ehtics committee of the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen ([2020-063]).

Data collection

We collected the clinical manifestations, laboratory results, chest CT, treatment methods, and outcomes of 26 children, and the data was updated until February 19. To ensure the accuracy of the data, the data were independently checked by two clinicians. Each .

Result

Investigations into the sources of exposure indicate a history of contact with person from Hubei or family clusters in each case. There were 9 males (35%) and 17 females (65%), with an average age of 6.9 (0.7) years, ranging from 1 to 13 years (table 1). None of the above children had underlying diseases such as congenital diseases, dysplasia, diabetes, etc. Because some children cannot expresss independently, the clinical symptoms were mainly objective symptoms. Most patients had fever and cough at admission. About one-third of the patients had no clear symptoms, and other symptoms included vomiting, diarrhea, and rhinorrhoea (table 1). According to the standard,8 cases(31%) were mild and 18(69%) were ordinary. No severe complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) occurred in the cases. Laboratory results revealed that most of the blood routine showed normal or decreased white blood cell counts, lymphocytes generally increased, and hemoglobin .

There were no significant abnormalities in coagulation function. In terms of biochemistry, Alanine transaminase (ALT) combine with glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST) increased in two cases(8%),ALT or AST increased in one case(4%).In addition, all the above cases had not exceed 50% of the normal high value. Most of the myocardial enzymes(myoglobin, troponin, kinase, creatine kinase) were not abnormal, with only a significant increase in LDH(46%). In the field of inflammatory mediators (table 2) , procalcitonin was normal, and 5(19%) patients had elevated C-reative protein. 19 patients were tested for interleukin-6 and only one had an increase. T-lymphocyte subset analysis showed no abnormalities in CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+.Humoral immunity showed that IgA, IgG, and C3c were partially reduced (table 2) , and IgM and C4 were normal. According to chest X-ray and chest CT examination, 8 patients(31%) had no pulmonary infiltration. There were 11 cases(42%) of lateral pulmonary infiltration and 7 cases(27%) of bilateral pulmonary infiltration.All patients were treated in isolation. Medicines for treating COVID-19 include oseltamivir, ribavirin, interferon, kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine.4 patients (15%) were treated with interferon alone and 1 patient (4%) was treated with kaletra alone.26 patients discharge (13.6±1.03 days on average) or improvement after treatment.

DISCUSSION

There was no significant increase in inflammatory indexes and mild clinical symptoms in 26 patients, all of them were mild and common type cases, no severe pneumonia cases and death cases, and the outcome was similar to that of SARS. Among them, 11 patients (about 42%) had fever, which was inconsistent with 98% of the .

Other symptoms such as nasal obstruction, runny nose, vomiting and diarrhea [1, 3, 6] were less common than adults.All of the above suggest that the clinical symptoms of children infected with 2019-CoV were not typical. It is considered that most of the children might be infected after exposure to patients with COVID-19, which belongs to the second or third generation of infected cases, and the pathogenicity of the virus is decreased.In addition, the changes of leukocytes in children were the same as in adults, and most of them appear normal or decreased. Lymphocytes in adult patients had decreased significantly, and this study found that most of the children's lymphocytes increased beyond the normal range, which might be related to the higher percentage of The literature reported that the prognosis of elderly patients and those with chronic .

In this study, the prognosis of children with COVID-19 was good, and the prognosis was different from that of middle-aged and elderly patients in other studies. Consider that the difference was related to thymic immune function. In the treatment of SARS patients, drugs such as glucocorticoids and thymosin were used [7] . Although there was no clinical evidence to support the use of glucocorticoids [8] , whether early use of thymosin and gamma globulin for immunomodulation in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 can reduce cytokine storms, reduce clinical symptoms and improve prognosis requires further exploration.Except that LDH increased in the myocardial zymogram of children with COVID-19 in the study, other enzymes such as creatine kinase and troponin I were normal. In addition to being derived from the heart muscle, LDH was also found in the liver and kidneys.We speculated that the increase in LDH may not originate from the myocardium, suggesting that children's infections were less likely to affect the myocardium. Similar to other studies [1, 3, 4] , this study found that ALT and AST increased, so we cannot rule out the effect of 2019-nCoV on the liver and induce the increase of liver enzymes. As patients often use antiviral drugs in the early stage of hospitalization, it was also necessary to consider the increase of liver enzymes caused by drug factors. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had been shown to be one of the main receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells [9, 10] , while ACE2 was at high expression levels in the kidney, vas deferens and testicular mesenchymal cells [11] .SARS had been shown to cause orchitis and affect spermatogenesis function [11, 12] .Although acute renal impairment had not yet occurred in pediatric cases, .

The specimens included nasopharyngeal swabs, blood, sputum, and anal swabs. We found that nasal swabs and anal swabs were positive even without respiratory symptoms such as cough and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea Therefore, the source of samples cannot be selected based on clinical manifestations, and should be submitted multiple times and at multiple sites to avoid misdiagnosis of patients with mild imaging without imaging manifestations. Although there is no clinical evidence that the virus is transmitted through the conjunctival pathway [13] , mother-infant, and breast-milk [4] , researchers have detected the virus in urine [14] , saliva [15] , suggesting that novel coronavirus has a wide range of transmission routes.The clinical classification of children was mostly mild or ordinary type, so the treatment plan is relatively simple. In some cases, the nucleic acid test turned negative after treatment with interferon atomization or lopinavir ritonavir. For mild children, symptomatic treatment or single use of traditional Chinese medicine needs to be further verified.The sample size of this study was only 26, and it was a retrospective study, so it has certain limitations. On the one hand, the article only included children aged 1-14 years.The characteristics of newborns infected with COVID-19 are not clear, and whether there are differences in the disease characteristics of infants, preschool and school-age children need further research; On the other hand, the changes of T lymphocyte subsets in children need to be tracked and observed during the course of the disease..

"Abstract

There is concern about a new coronavirus, the 2019-nCoV, as a global public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequence of 2019-nCoV and 12 whole genome sequences highly similar sequences available in gene bank (5 from SARS, 2 from MERS and 5 from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus). FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to infect humans. author/funder.

"Abstract

Bats are notorious reservoirs of diverse, potentially zoonotic viruses, exemplified by the 20 evolutionarily distinct, influenza A-like viruses H17N10 and H18N11 (BatIVs). The surface 21 glycoproteins [haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N)] of BatIVs neither bind nor cleave 22 sialic acid receptors, which suggests that these viruses employ cell attachment and entry 23 mechanisms that differ from those of classical influenza A viruses (IAVs). Identifying the 24 cellular factors that mediate entry and determine susceptibility to infection will help assess 25 the host range of BatIVs. Here, we investigated a range of cell lines from different species for 26 author/funder. All rights reserved.

to accommodate SA 2, 15, 17 . The cell receptors for the BatIVs are as yet unidentified, but they 79 are clearly not SA moieties, a conclusion reached by several studies 15, 18, 19 . Furthermore, bat 80 N10 and N11 are structurally similar to classical NAs but lack conserved amino acids for SA 81 binding and cleavage 2, 16, 17 and do not exhibit typical neuraminidase activity 18, 20 . Initial 82 efforts to isolate infectious BatIVs directly from bats have failed, mainly because the receptors 83were unknown and susceptible cell lines were unavailable 21, 22, 23 . Attempts to circumvent 84 these limitations have included H17-or H18-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV 19, 85 DLA-DRA is a well-conserved orthologue of the human leukocyte antigen class II DR α-chain 157 (HLA-DRA) (∼90% amino acid identity between canine, human and Desmodus rotundus bat 158 ectodomains; Supplementary material 3). In humans, MHC-II molecules occur as three highly 159 polymorphic isotypes (HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ) which are selectively expressed 160 under normal conditions on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs), including B, 161 dendritic and mononuclear phagocyte cells. These molecules are non-covalently associated 162 heterodimers of two glycosylated, transmembrane polypeptide chains, the monomorphic 163 35-kDa α-chain and the highly polymorphic 28-kDa β-chain 36 . Both chains have an 164 extracellular portion composed of two domains (α1 and α2, or β1 and β2) that is anchored 165 on the cell membrane by short transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 2c ). In the 166 classical scenario, the protease-derived foreign antigen peptides bind to MHC class II proteins 167 in the cleft formed by the α1 and β1 domains, and the complex is transported to the cell 168 surface 36, 37 . When antigenic peptides are not available, endogenous peptides such as the class 169 II associated invariant peptide (CLIP) substitute them and restore MHC class II dimer 170 stability 37 . The complex of HLA-DR and endocytosed peptides (usually 9-30 amino acids in 171 length), constitutes a ligand for the T-cell receptor (TCR) and plays a key role in the 172 presentation of foreign antigens to CD4 + T helper cells and immune surveillance 38, 39 . 173

Since the ultimate goal of our studies is to obtain insight on the zoonotic potential of H17N10, 175 we focused on the possible influence of HLA-DR on cellular susceptibility to H17. Hence, 176 taking advantage of the high expression of HLA-DR on certain human hematopoietic 177 carcinomas 40 , we further explored H17-PV tropism using a panel of human leukaemia and 178 lymphoma cell lines (Fig. 2d) . We found that the Burkitt's lymphoma-derived Raji, Ramos and 179 BJAB B-lymphocytes and the B lymphoblastoid cells (B-LCL) show decreasing susceptibility, 180 in that order, to H17-PV. Kasumi-1 leukaemic cells showed marginal susceptibility in terms of 181 luciferase activity, while Molt-4 and HL-60 leukaemic cells, Jurkat T-cells, pro-monocytic THP-182 1 and U-937 cells, and primary B cells showed no susceptibility to the pseudotypes (Fig. 2d,  183 left Y axis). We hypothesised that the different susceptibility of the various cell types by H17-184 PV were due to disparate expression of HLA-DR, confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis for a non-185 polymorphic region of the α chain of HLA-DR on the same samples (Fig. 2d , right Y-axis). The 186presence of the HLA-DR heterodimer was also confirmed by flow cytometry with a FITC-187 conjugated monoclonal antibody (clone Tü36), which specifically binds to a monomorphic 188 epitope on the HLA-DR α/β complex and not the isolated α or β chains (Fig. 2e) cells correspondingly reduced the infection of H17-PV by 50% (Fig. 2f) . 203

To determine if blocking attachment of virus to the HLA-DR ectodomain can prevent its entry, 205Raji cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of a monoclonal antibody (mAb 206 Clone 302CT2.3.2) targeting a monomorphic, extracellular region of the HLA-DRA antigen 207 author/funder.

The presence of the antibody significantly reduced, in 208 a dose-dependent manner, infection with H17-PV but not VSV-G-PV (Fig. 2g) . 209

We next sought to ascertain whether ectopic expression of HLA-DR was sufficient to increase 211 the susceptibility of non-APC, HEK293T/17, cells to the H17-PVs. HEK293T/17 cells were 212 transiently transfected with the DRA expression vector, alone or in combination with DRB1. Taken together, HLA-DR is shown to function as a bona fide entry mediator for H17 but may 226 function with unknown factors that facilitate virus internalisation. Interaction between HLA-227 DR and H17 may trigger viral entry through canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis, but 228 could also trigger entry through an activation of cell signalling pathways that the virus 229 subverts to its advantage. Our finding therefore raises questions on the utility and possible 230 evolutionary advantage(s) that an APC-associated receptor would confer to H17N10 231 infectivity and broader fitness.

"Abstract

A SIRU-type epidemic model is proposed for the prediction of COVID-19 spreading within Brasil, and analyse the influence of public health measures on simulating the control of this infectious disease. Since the reported cases are typically only a fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, the model accounts for both reported and unreported cases. Also, the model allows for the time variation of both the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, so as to reflect public health interventions, towards its control, along the course of the epidemic evolution. An analytical exponential behaviour for the accumulated reported cases evolution is assumed at the onset of the epidemy, for explicitly estimating initial conditions, while a Bayesian inference approach is adopted for parametric estimations employing the present direct problem model with the data from the known portion of the epidemics evolution, represented by the time series for the reported cases of infected individuals. The direct-inverse problem analysis is then employed with the actual data from China, with the first half been employed for the parametric estimation and the second half for validation of the predictive capability of the proposed approach. The full dataset for China is then employed in another parameter identification, aimed at refining the values for the average times that asymptomatic infectious individuals and that symptomatic individuals remain infectious. Following this validation, the available data on reported cases in Brasil from February 15 th till March 29 th , 2020, is used for estimating parameters and then predict the epidemy evolution under these conditions. Finally, public health interventions are simulated, aimed at diminishing the effects of the disease spreading, by acting on both the transmission rate and the fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, considering time variable exponential behaviours for these two parameters, usually assumed constant in epidemic evolutions without intervention. It is demonstrated that a combination of actions to affect both parameters can have a much faster and effective result in the control of the epidemy dynamics. : medRxiv preprint the analysis of the impact of public health measures [1], which however did not consider in the modelling the presence of unreported infection cases, which are in practice inherent to this process. The present work is first based on the SIR-type model proposed in [2] , which deals with the epidemic outbreak in Wuhan by introducing the unreported cases in the modelling, and evaluating the consequences of public health interventions. It was a direct application of previous developments [3, 4] on the fundamental problem of parameter identification in mathematical epidemic models, accounting for unreported cases. This same modelling approach was more recently employed in the analysis of the epidemic outbreak in different countries,

","INTRODUCTION

A new human coronavirus started spreading in Wuhan, China, by the end of 2019, and turned into a pandemic disease called COVID-19 as declared by the World Health Organization on March 11 th , 2020. The affected countries and cities around the world have been reacting in different ways, towards locally controlling the disease evolution.These measures include general isolation through quarantine and massive testing for focused isolation, with varying degrees of success so far, as can be analysed from the limited data available. Naturally, China offers the longest time series on reported infected cases and the resulting effects of combining different public health interventions. As of March 26 th , 2020, there were no reports in China of further internal contaminations, and all the new cases are associated with infected individuals that (re)entered in the country.Despite the apparent success of the interventions in China, each region or country might require a specific combination of measures, due to demographic spatial distribution and age structure, health system capabilities, and social-economical characteristics. In this sense, it urges to have a mathematical model that would allow for the simulation of such possible interventions on the epidemic evolution within the following few weeks or months. This article presents a collaborative research effort towards the construction of an epidemic evolution prediction tool, which combines direct and inverse problem analysis and is both reliable and easy to implement and execute, initially motivated by offering some insight into the control of COVID-19 within Brasil.The classical susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model describes the transmission of diseases between susceptible and infective individuals and provides the basic framework for almost all later epidemic models. At the onset of the coronavirus epidemy in China, there were some initial studies for the prediction of its evolution and and France [5] [6] [7] . Besides identifying unreported cases, this simple and robust model also allows for introducing a latency period and a time variable transmission rate, which can simulate a public health orientation change such as in a general isolation measure. In addition, an analytical exponential behaviour is assumed for the accumulated reported cases evolution along a second phase just following the onset of the epidemy, which, upon fitting of the available data, allows for the explicit analytical estimation of the transmission rate and the associated initial conditions required by the model.Here, the SIR-type model in [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] is implemented for the direct problem formulation of the COVID-19 epidemic evolution, adding a time variable parametrization for the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, a very important parameter in the public health measure associated with massive testing and consequent focused isolation. The same analytical identification procedure is maintained for the required initial conditions, as obtained from the early stages exponential behaviour. However, a Bayesian inference approach is here adopted for parametric estimation, employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with the Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . At first, the goal of the inverse problem analysis was estimating the parameters associated with the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, which can be quite different in the various regions and countries and also very according to the public health measures. Then, in light of the success in this parametric identification, an extended estimation was also employed which incorporates the average time the asymptomatic infectious are asymptomatic and the average time the infectious stay in the symptomatic condition, due to the relative uncertainty on these parameters in the literature. The proposed approach was then applied to the data from China, first by taking just the first half of these data points in the estimation, while using the second half to validate the model using the estimated parameters with just the first half of the epidemy evolution, and second by employing the whole time series in the MCMC estimation procedure, thus identifying parameters for the whole evolution period. This second estimation was particularly aimed at refining the data for the average times that asymptomatic infectious individuals and that symptomatic individuals remain infectious.Upon validation of the approach through the data for China, we have proceeded to the analysis of the epidemic dynamics in Brasil, after about 35 days of collected information on reported infected individuals. First, the available data was employed in the parametric estimation, followed by the prediction of the epidemy evolution in Brasil. Then, we have explored the time variation of both the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, so as to reflect public health interventions, in simulating possible government measures, as described in what follows.

DIRECT PROBLEM

The implemented SIR-type model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] is given by the following initial value problem:where,with initial conditions + ν2(t) = ν. The transmission rate, τ(t), is also allowed to be a time variable function along the evolution process. Figure 1 below illustrates the infection process as a flow chart.

Figure 1 -Flow chart illustrating the infection path process [3].

The time variable coefficients, τ(t) and f(t), are given by:These parametrized functions are particularly useful in interpreting the effects of public health interventions. For instance, the transmission rate, τ(t), is particularly affected by a reduced circulation achieved through a general isolation or quarantine measure, while the fraction f(t) of asymptomatic infectious that become reported, thus isolated, cases can be drastically increased by a massive testing measure with focused isolation. In the above relations, is the attenuation factor for the transmission rate, N is the time in days for application of the public health intervention to change transmission rate, is the argument of the f(t) variation between the limits ( 0 , ). The first time variable function has been previously considered, while the second one has been introduced in the present work, so as to allow the examination of combined measures.The cumulative number of reported cases at time t,( ), which is the quantity offered by the actual available data, and the a priori unknown cumulative number of unreported cases, ( ), are given by:The daily number of reported cases from the model, ( ), can be obtained by computing the solution of the following equation:with initial conditions

INVERSE PROBLEM

Inverse problem analysis is nowadays a common practice in various science and engineering contexts, in which the groups involved with experimental data and numerical simulation synergistically collaborate so as to obtain the maximum information from the available data, towards the best possible use of the modelling for the problem under study.Here, as mentioned in the introduction, we first review an analytical parametric identification described in more details in [4] [5] [6] [7] , that from the initial phases of the epidemic evolution allows to explicitly obtain the unknown initial conditions of the model, while offering a reliable estimate for the transmission rate at the onset of the epidemy. Nevertheless, even after these estimates, a few other parameters in the model remain uncertain, either due to the specific characteristics of the physical conditions or reaction to the epidemy in each specific region, or due to lack of epidemiological information on the disease itself. Therefore, an inverse problem analysis was undertaken aimed at estimating the main parameters involved in the model, as summarized in Table   1 below. First, for the dataset on the accumulated reported cases for China, the focus is on the parametrized time variation of the transmission rate ( 0 and ) and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported ( 0 ), in this case assumed constant, followed by an effort to refine the information on the average times (1/ν and 1/η) through All rights reserved.

Then, employing the dataset for Brasil, the parametrized time variation of the transmission rate ( 0 and ) and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported ( 0 ), initially assumed constant, are estimated. In addition, due to the behaviour of the estimated CR(t) curve in this case, it is also attempted to estimate a possible time variation for the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported, ( ), by parametrization of an abrupt variation that requires just the estimation of and . The statistical inversion approach here implemented falls within the Bayesian statistical framework [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , in which (probability distribution) models for the measurements and the unknowns are constructed separately and explicitly, as shall be briefly reviewed in what follows.As explained in previous works employing this model [4] [5] [6] [7] , it is assumed that in the early phase of the epidemic, the cumulative number of reported cases grows approximately exponentially, according to the following functional form:After fitting this function to the early stages of the epidemic evolution, one may extract the information on the unknown initial conditions, in the form [4] [5] [6] [7] :All rights reserved.

For estimating P, we assume that a vector of measured data is available (Y) containing the measurements Yi at time ti, i = 1, …, I.Bayes' theorem can then be stated as [8] [9] :where  posterior (P) is the posterior probability density, that is, the conditional probability of the parameters P given the measurements Y,  prior (P) is the prior density, that is, the coded information about the parameters prior to the measurements,  (Y|P) is the likelihood function, which expresses the likelihood of different measurement outcomes involved, allowing one to do Bayesian inference even in rich and complex models. The idea behind the Metropolis-Hasting sampling algorithm is illustrated below, and these steps should be repeat until it is judged that a sufficiently representative sample has been generated.

Start the chain with an initial value, that usually comes from any prior information that you may have;2) Randomly generate a proposed jump aiming that the chain will move around and efficiently explores the region of the parameter space. The proposal distribution can take on many different forms, in this work a Gaussian random walk was employed, implying that the proposed jumps will usually be near the current one;3) Compute the probability of moving from the current value to the proposed one.Candidates moving to regions of higher probability will be definitely accepted.Candidates in regions of lower probability can be accepted only probabilistically. If the proposed jump is rejected, the current value is tally again.

Model Validation: China

Before proceeding to the analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic evolution within Brasil, the major concern in the present contribution, the need was felt in validating the proposed direct-inverse problem analysis approach.

The data for China was extracted from [6] , complemented by the most recent data from [13] up to March 25 th , 2020. The exponential fit for the early phase of the China CR(t) dataset provided the estimates of the three parameters, 1 = 0.14936, 2 = 0.37680, 3 = 1.0, from which we have estimated 0 = 5.046. The remaining data for the initial conditions, 0 and 0 , and the early stage transmission rate, 0 , are in fact recalculated from within the MCMC algorithm, since the changing values of f will affect them, according to eqs. (7.c-e). The average times in the model were taken as 1/ν=7 and 1/η=7 days and the isolation measures were taken at N=29 days [6] . First, experimental data from China from the period of January 19 th up to February 17 th was employed in demonstrating the estimation of three parameters, 0 , , and 0 , assuming there is no significant time variation in the function f(t) ( = 0).In the absence of more informative priors, uniform distributions were employed for all three parameters under estimation. Table 1 presents the prior information and the initial guesses for the parameters. If the initial guesses were used to predict the CR(t) behavior, an over-estimation of the accumulated reported infected individuals would occur, especially in the long term, as can be noticed in Figure 1 , confirming the need for a proper parameter estimation.

Although the present estimated parameters have led to a good prediction of the second half of the China epidemic evolution data, there are still uncertainties associated with the average times here assumed both equal to 7 days, according to [6] .

For this reason, we have also implemented a statistical inverse analysis with the full dataset of China, but now seeking the estimation of five parameters, so as to simultaneously estimate the average times (1/ν and 1/η). Both uniform and Gaussian distributions were adopted for the two new parameters, with initial guesses of 1/ν=7 days and 1/η=7 days, and N=29 days, as employed in [6] . Table 3 provides the estimated values and 95% confidence intervals for all five parameters, with Gaussian priors for the two average times with data obtained from [14, 17] . The most affected parameter in comparison with the previous estimates is the average time 1/η, which is also the one with widest confidence interval. This behaviour is also evident from the Markov chains for this parameter, now simultaneously estimated. Figure 5 compares the theoretical predictions with the model incorporating the five estimated parameters as in Table 3 , against the full CR(t) dataset for China, confirming the improved agreement. 

Model Application: Brasil

The CR(t) data for the accumulated reported infectious in Brasil, from February 25 th , when the first infected individual was reported, up to March 29 th , is presented in the Appendix. First, the exponential phase of the evolution was fitted, taking the data from day 10 to 25, yielding the estimates of the three parameters, 1 For instance, in the analysis of the Italy epidemic evolution reported in [6] , with data from January 31 st to March 8 th , a comparable low attenuation factor of = 0.032 was identified. It is also possible to observe the lower value of the parameter 0 , in comparison to the value obtained for the China dataset, which represents that only around 30% of the infected symptomatic individuals become in fact reported cases. This result could reflect an initial protocol of not thoroughly testing the mildly symptomatic individuals or just a lack of enough testing kits. This fact shall be discussed again further ahead when the impact of public health measures is analysed. Figure 6 illustrates the good agreement of Brasil's full dataset (period from February 25th till March 29th) with the mathematical model predictions, after adopting the estimated values for the parameters in Table 4 . The theoretical CR(t) curve is plotted together with the 95% confidence interval bounds for this simulated evolution.

Five scenarios were here explored: (i) the present public health interventions remain unchanged; (ii) a stricter isolation is implemented from now on, further reducing the transmission rate; (iii) an attenuation on the social isolation policy, leading to an increased transmission rate; (iv) an increment on the fraction of reported cases, through a massive blood testing campaign, for instance, forcing more unreported cases to become All rights reserved.

Therefore, let us consider after day N2=40, 50% improvement with respect to the value of here identified, thus around, 2 =0.0831, and simultaneously increase the fraction of reported and unreported infectious cases, to become = 0.7185, also starting after day N2=40, with =0.5. The changes in the accumulated reported and unreported cases, as shown in Figure 11 , are the most encouraging in the present analysis.The predicted number of unreported infectious cases is now reaching after 150 days around 36,770 individuals, while the reported cases should reach 50,006 individuals, with a marked decrease to a total of around 86,777 infectious cases, about 30% reduction with respect to the base case. The predicted evolution of the daily reported infectious cases would then show a peak at around t=46 days of about 2,196 reported cases. Again, though this peak value is higher than for the base case, before the public health improvements, a number of these are of mild symptomatic cases that were moved from the unreported to the reported cases evolution, thus moved to monitored isolation earlier, and not necessarily requiring hospitalization. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049130 doi: medRxiv preprint Though the three parameters estimation provides a fairly good reproduction of the behaviour of the CR(t) curve for Brasil, one may observe a change in the pattern of the evolution around day 30, that could not be entirely followed by the proposed model. It is also a known fact that the initial amount of kits for blood testing that were purchased by the Brazilian government were finished around this time, and before being fully supplemented, there could have been a reduction on the number of executed exams of the symptomatic individuals, that might have affected the partition of reported to unreported cases by the end of this period covered by the present dataset. Therefore, the more general model including the time variation of the partition f(t), eqs.(4.c,d), is here implemented for a more refined inverse problem analysis. It is then expected that a reduction on the f value can be identified ( < 0 ), with an abrupt variation on the exponential behaviour, here assumed as a sharp functional time dependence (large ). Therefore, an additional statistical inverse problem analysis is undertaken, this time for estimating five parameters, namely, 0 , , 0 , , and , aimed at improving the overall agreement with the CR(t) data behaviour, with a possible reduction on the partition of the reported and unreported the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049130 doi: medRxiv preprint infectious cases. With uniform distributions for all five parameters, taking the previous estimates for the three first parameters, an arbitrary guesses for , and , the five estimated parameters are shown in Table 5 , together with the 95% confidence interval for each parameter. Figure 12 shows the theoretical CR(t) curve obtained with the five parameters estimation, plotted together with the 95% confidence interval bounds for this simulated evolution. One can see the marked reduction on the f(t) parameter from the estimates in Table 5, which results in the increase of the unreported to reported infectious cases, as is shown in Figure 13 .a for CR(t) and CU(t) predictions up to 150 days. Clearly, the reduction on the testing, and thus on the isolation of reported infectious individuals, leads to an impressive increase on the total number of infected individuals after 150 days (723,698 cases), including unreported (609,125) and reported cases (114,572). Figure 13 .b presents the predicted evolution of the daily reported infectious cases, which shows a peak at around t=61 days of about 2,672 reported cases.Hopefully this difficulty with the availability of enough testing kits that occurred around day 30 has been already solved and the desirable increase on the number of tests and reported cases will be apparent from the next few entries in the accumulated reported cases. From the present results it is quite clear that the reduction on the testing has unfortunate consequences on the epidemic evolution. At the end of this report, the predicted results for CR(t) provided the value of 5438 reported cases, in comparison to the officially announced value of 5717 cases on March 31 st , 2020.All rights reserved.

CONCLUSIONS

The present work implements a mixed analytical-statistical inverse problem analysis to the prediction of epidemics evolution, with focus on the COVID-19 progression in Brasil.A SIRU-type model is implemented for the direct problem solution, while a mixture of an analytical parametric estimation for the early phase epidemic exponential behavior with a Bayesian inference approach for the entire period, are considered for the inverse problem analysis. The evolution of the COVID-19 epidemy in China is considered for validation purposes, by taking the first part of the dataset to estimate parameters, and retaining the rest of the evolution data for direct comparison with the predicted results, with excellent agreement. Then, the same approach is applied to the Brazilian case, this time employing the available time series so far for the parametric estimates, and then offering an evolution prediction. Also, some public health intervention measures are critically examined, in addition to those already implemented, permitting the inspection of their impact on the overall dynamics of the disease proliferation. Clearly, a combination of public health interventions can offer a considerable impact reduction on the disease progression within Brasil, as illustrated by the implemented modelling. It was also analyzed the negative impact due to the scarcity of testing kits during a period, which if not solved and even incremented, would lead to an increase on the ratio of unreported to reported symptomatic cases, and consequently on a dramatic epidemic evolution.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the applicability of 13 a pooled-sample testing protocol to screen large populations more rapidly and with limited 14 resources is discussed. A Bayesian inference analysis in which hierarchical testing stages can have 15 different sensitivities is implemented and benchmarked against early COVID-19 testing data. 16 Optimal pool size and increases in throughput and case detection are calculated as a function of 17 disease prevalence. Even for moderate losses in test sensitivity upon pooling, substantial increases 18 in testing throughput and detection efficiency are predicted, suggesting that sample pooling is a 19 viable avenue to circumvent current testing bottlenecks for COVID-19.

Key epidemiologic strategies for control of community spread include contact tracing, 23 case isolation, ring containment, and social distancing (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . The use of microbiological testing to 24 identify disease cases is a crucially important element of these strategies. Some countries, including 25 the US, experienced a shortage of kits needed for COVID-19 diagnosis, which resulted in the 26 imposition of restrictive criteria to manage the selection of patients for testing. Constraints in the 27 supply of kits had a particularly significant impact on testing of mildly symptomatic individuals, as 28 well as asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases. For some facilities that have been overwhelmed 29 by demand for testing as the pandemic progressed, test throughput continues to be a limiting factor 30 (8-10). Strategies for screening more individuals with a reduced burden on resources are highly 31 desirable.

Anticipated benefits include easing the demand of constrained resources and enabling 33 more efficient detection of a larger number of cases. 34 Molecular assays are the predominant testing method for viral and bacterial pathogens (11-14). 35 Specifically, nucleic acid detection assays typically employ real-time polymerase chain reaction 36 (RT-PCR) for DNA targets and reverse-transcription real-time PCR (rRT-PCT) for RNA targets 37 (15, 16) .

"Abstract

Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples.This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.All rights reserved.

","Introduction

The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has generated global concern given its rapid spread in multiple countries and possible fatal progression of the infection. Initially, many patients reported exposure at a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China, suggesting animal-to-person transmission of the virus. However, since then many patients have reported no exposure to animal markets, indicating that person-to-person transmission is occurring. There is currently no vaccine or targeted therapeutic for COVID-19.COVID-19 is difficult to diagnose early in infection as patients can remain asymptomatic or present with non-specific flu-like clinical symptoms including fever, cough, or shortness of breath.Symptoms may appear in as few as 2 days or up to 2 weeks after exposure. 1 Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) for COVID-19 in serum or respiratory samples is currently the standard for diagnostic molecular testing. However, this requires expensive equipment and trained personnel.Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a one-step nucleic acid amplification method based on PCR technology that has been used to diagnose infectious diseases. 2 RT-LAMP has several advantages including that it has high specificity and sensitivity, can be done in less than an hour, can work at various pH and temperature ranges which is advantageous for clinical samples, 3 and that the reagents are relatively low cost and can be stable at room temperature. We have previously used this method to detect zika virus in clinical serum and urine samples as well as mosquitos. 4, 5 This study describes a RT-LAMP methodology that can detect COVID-19 in simulated patient samples in under 30 minutes. The test could be used at the point-of-care by field and local personnel for the rapid diagnosis of individuals for optimal treatment, isolation, and rapid contact tracking as well as the investigation of outbreaks of unknown respiratory diseases.

RT-LAMP is specific and sensitive for COVID-19

To establish the optimal conditions for RT-LAMP using a COVID-19 PCR-standard designed from nucleotide 2941-3420 of the COVID-19 Wuhan-Hu-1 complete genome (MN908947), several primer sets, ranges of temperatures (57-65°C), and incubation times (15-45 mins) were tested. The best amplification results were obtained at 63 ° C for 30 minutes as indicated by a banding pattern after electrophoresis on a gel (Fig 1) . Positive reactions containing SYBR Green I could be observed by naked eye by a color change from orange to yellow (Fig 1-top 1) . In order to determine the lower detection limit of the RT-LAMP reaction for COVID-19, a dilution series ranging from 0.204 fg to 10 ng COVID-19 was amplified (Fig 2) . The limit of detection was approximately equivalent to 1.02 fg. This dilution series was run in parallel with qRT-PCR using primers that targeted this same region of COVID-19 genome; the qRT-PCR Ct values for the dilution series are reported in Supplemental Table 1 .

COVID-19 Detection in Simulated Clinical Samples with RT-LAMP

To demonstrate the clinical utility of this system for COVID-19 detection, we spiked various human specimens with COVID-19, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Betacoronavirus England-1 (BtCoV), or Murine hepatitis virus (MHV). MERS, BtCoV and MHV spiked samples were used to test the specificity of the RT-LAMP assay. Spiked specimens included serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs as we wanted to verify that substances present in these samples would not interfere with RT-LAMP.

Only samples containing COVID-19, but not MERS, BtCoV, or MHV, had positive RT-LAMP reactions indicating specificity of the reaction for COVID-19 (Fig 3) . Furthermore, RT-LAMP could be successfully completed using human serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs.

RT-LAMP is Specific for COVID-19

The sequence of the RT-LAMP primers were also compared to aligned sequences of various strains of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses (SARS) or coronaviruses commonly associated with the common cold (human coronavirus strains 229E, NL63, HKU1, or OC43). These other coronaviruses had 27-54% nucleotide mismatch with our RT-LAMP primers, making it highly unlikely they would give a positive RT-LAMP result, supporting the specificity of this assay for COVID-19 ( Table 2 ). Given that viruses are prone to genetic mutation, we likewise examined if RT-LAMP primers had any mismatch with 27 different isolated strains of COVID-19 from various locations. There was 0% mismatch with all the strains examined, suggesting that these RT-LAMP primers would identify all 27 strains of COVID-19 examined (Supplemental Table 2 ).

Discussion

Given the rapid emergence of COVID-19 and the severe complications that can result including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia, improved diagnostic options that are fast, reliable, easy, and affordable are required. This is critical since COVID-19 infection can rapidly progress from hospital admission to ARDS in as few as 2 days, and COVID-19 infection can be fatal. 1 Conventional qRT-PCR, while specific and sensitive, must be done by trained personnel on specialized equipment at a qualified laboratory. Since this disease is spreading rapidly, centralized labs may have trouble keeping up with testing demands or may need an alternative approach if qRT-PCR kits are not available.

This study sought to improve upon this by developing a potential point-of-care test. Point-ofcare testing has several advantages for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 and must be easy to use, inexpensive, fast, and require little if any laboratory infrastructure while maintaining sensitivity and specificity. RT-LAMP meets these requirements and therefore has large value for screening and testing for COVID-19 in potentially exposed populations.We sought to determine if this RT-LAMP assay worked in a range of different samples that might be collected in a clinical setting or as a possible non-invasive screening tool. This is important since it may not be feasible to collect serum from all patients, especially patients who are critically sick, dehydrated, the elderly, children, and neonates. Personnel trained in collecting blood specimens may also not be available, Furthermore, biological samples may contain chemicals that can inhibit nucleic acid assays if the sample is tested directly without first isolating the RNA. RT-LAMP worked in all the human sample types tested, and in samples from several individuals. We previously demonstrated that RT-LAMP for ZIKV does not require prior RNA isolation from the samples. 4, 5 Thus, we used unprocessed urine or serum samples in this study, which saves considerable time and reduced costs. In this RT-LAMP assay for COVID-19, the urine samples gave stronger RT-LAMP signals than the serum samples when spiked with identical amounts of COVID-19; however the amount of virus present in an infected individual will likely vary between different biological specimens and over the time course of the infection. Furthermore, we observed faint background banding by gel electrophoresis in oropharyngeal swabs, suggesting there may be some factor in this specimen that results in this. However, due to the specificity of the primers, we believe this does not interfere with correct interpretation of the RT-LAMP reaction, especially since the COVID-19 spiked sample can be correctly identified through color change and fluorescence .

Given that all the isolated strains of COVID-19 thus far have shown very little genetic differences, we anticipate that this RT-LAMP will detect COVID-19 with the same level of confidence as qRT-PCR. This COVID-19 RT-LAMP assay was highly specific as it did not give a positive result for MERS, BtCoV, and MHV and had significant mismatch with numerous strains of SARS and common cold associated human coronoavirus strains 229E, NL63, HKU1, or OC43. We tested a range of temperatures from 57°C to 65°C; all the temperatures gave comparable results, indicating that this RT-LAMP reaction has a large temperature range with an optimal temperate of 63 ° C . We also tested a range of incubation times from 15-45 minutes. The optimal time for detection of RT-LAMP products was 30 minutes, however COVID-19 RT-LAMP products were detectable by UV light excitation or banding patterns on gels in as little as 15 minutes.This study has several limitations. First, COVID-19 is Biosafety level 3 so our laboratory was unable to work directly with the virus or with infected samples. As such, all the experiments presented here used a nucleotide oligo of COVID-19 corresponding to the GenBank MN908947 sequence. Similarly, we were unable to directly test related coronaviruses and instead used nucleotide oligos from the same region of those viruses. However, these do represent a proof-of-feasibility for this assay, and the primers were further evaluated for specificity by BLASTing them to related coronavirus sequences. Although RT-LAMP reactions are highly specific, it is not a quantitative test. However other groups are working at improving the read outs of RT-LAMP assays including the use of smartphone-integrated sensors to make interpretation of the assay even more user-friendly. 8 RT-LAMP reactions can have a higher rate of false positives compared to qRT-PCR; we did not experience this in any of our no template negative control reactions, negative control samples, or other samples containing other coronaviruses.

"Abstract

Herewith we present a computational model for the forecasting of cumulative diagnosed cases of Covid-19 pneumonia within a country. The only explicit parameter of the model is the population density. The implicit parameter is a moving average ambient temperature, currently integrated into the kinetic constants. Other finer details pertaining to the mechanism of the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 spread within a given region are implicitly manifested in the exponent parameters derived from the non-linear fitting of the published data on Covid-19 occurrence. The performance of the model is demonstrated on a few selected countries, and on the Diamond Princess cruising ship outbreak. The model might be used as an aiding tool for the policy makers regarding the decisions on the containment measures and quarantine regime required.

","Introduction

The recent spread of freshly emerged pneumonia viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2 originating in Hubei province (China) has caused a great havoc across all regions of the world. First time in the civilization history quarantine measures of different magnitude were implemented in almost all countries, and passenger traffic ceased. The governmental reactions to the disease spread ranged. South-East Asia countries were tending more to strict martial-law style restrictions. Some of the Northern Europe governments were trying to promote ""herd immunity"" concept, where the vulnerable members of the society (e.g. the elderly and immuno-compromised) were isolated, while the others were allowed to be with no restrictions. Allegedly, this strategy was to eventually terminate the disease spread due to most of the society would be immune.The important result of all these diverse actions is that each country happened to be in a sufficient isolation from the others, maintaining its specific climate and social conditions. It is hardly possible to account for all miniscule factors contributing to the pathogen spread in each case, so that one needs certain simplifications in order to be able to forecast the disease progression.The following factors are drawing immediate attention:1. The diagnosed cases appear to be able to reach a plateau, without spreading to all population (as witnessed by the examples of China and Diamond Princess ship). 2. There is an indication that the disease spread is much slower in hotter climates and in certain humidity levels. A clear example is India and most of Africa, where the cases are very low compared to the population numbers. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the temperature optimum for the SARS-CoV viruses stability in the environment is around 4°C, yet the humidity also have significant impact [1, 2] . 3. A relatively lengthy incubation period (5-14 days [3] ) combined with about tenfold rate of undiagnosed cases [4] compared to the reported ones signals that the virus is struggling reproducing in humans. In other terms, it is fast to spread, but not thermodynamically stable once inside the body.These observations fit well into a range of processes, which could be described by the kinetics of an autocatalytic chemical reaction. The corresponding model and its outcomes is presented below.

Model

The data for the model were obtained from a daily updated resource at European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-datageographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide).There was only one country so far, which has clearly demonstrated the total number of diagnosed Covid-19 case to reach a plateau, China (Fig. 1) . Assuming that would be a general scenario other countries will follow, the starting points of the model were derived from this case.The S-shaped curve on Fig. 1 is typical for autocatalytic reactions, when the rate of the reaction is accelerated by its product:, Where k1 is the rate constant in terms of standard chemical kinetics. Indeed, if we take the number of healthy individuals for A, and the number of infected individuals for B, this reaction seems to be suitable for epidemiological modelling. We need some infected people to infect the healthy ones, and the more of sick people are around the faster it will happen:(1).

The population density shall serve as a proxy for chemical concentration in standard kinetic modelling.In the simple case above the process will go uninterrupted until no more healthy people available. As shown on Fig. 1 , the infection has stopped at approximately 80,000 individuals, which is a tiny fraction of China's 1.4 billion population. When such phenomena are observed in chemical processes, this is an indication of an existing equilibrium between the forward and reverse reaction, the latter proceeding with a separate rate constant k2:We have attempted first to fit the observed Covid-19 dynamics in China using equation (2), but the results were not satisfactory. The next step was to test a general case of the equilibrium above by introducing ""stoichiometric coefficients"" 1 a1, b1, b2:Then the rate is expressed as following:Since the total number of healthy and sick individuals equals to the country population, A + B equals the population density, which is constant for a given country, dP = total population/land area. Then we obtain the final expression for the infection rate:The parameters k1, k2 are the ""reaction rate constants"", specific for each country. They potentially allow one to account for the effect of temperature on the disease spread using the Arrhenius equation:Which for the epidemiology purposes could be simplified to (6) 1 We are using quotation marks since the modelling is done by analogy with chemical equilibrium; in the context of pathogen transmission these coefficients shall have a different meaning..

The experimental rate (day -1 ) dB/dt is equal then to the number of reported new cases divided by the country area. The simulated rate will be the one calculated from eq. (4) using a test set of the five model parameters (a1, b1, b2, k1, k2) . The final set of parameters was obtained by minimizing the sum of mean square deviations: ∑ ( − ) 2 for the specified data range.The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052985 doi: medRxiv preprint As expected, a kinetic system based on a non-linear equation (eq. 4) is quite sensitive to the data selection, and currently there is no universal criteria of how this selection should be done. Some insights on that are given at the end of the manuscript.However, the main uncertainty of the model is in the plateau height; the bend dates appear to be congruent. Currently ""the bend"" is defined simply as the date when 85% of the calculated plateau cases reached.Surprisingly, when only half of the data is used (Fig. 3) the fit was much better on one occasion. This would represent a real-life application of the model, and demonstrates its robustness on the incomplete data sets..

In the very beginning, the forecasts were completely random until enough data was accumulated. At the end (95 days of data), the model is quite consistent (Fig. 7) .This behaviour of the model makes it unusable for the forecast of the infection progression in the countries with low reported cases (notably, most of African countries)

Results

We have finished simulations on ten countries and Diamond Princess liner. Regrettably only China, the liner, and probably South Korea could be used to demonstrate the performance of the model. Other countries were modelled blindly, so that these instances could be proven right or wrong only as the disease propagates. Nevertheless, below we are presenting current results, with some critical remarks.

China

This is the only country which is allegedly about to complete the infection cycle, with 81620 total diagnosed cases and 1727 remaining active cases (as of April 03, 2020). Therefore it has been the main testing ground for the model. Below we present four modelling outcomes, which differ only in the selection of the data set (red dots on the graphs). Brown dots are the cumulative reported cases, which were not included in the model; blue dashed line is the model's forecast based on the start day..

Diamond Princess cruise ship

Diamond Princess is a cruise ship, which was bound to quarantine in the port of Yokohama, Japan on 5 February 2020 after a passenger has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The epidemiology of the virus outbreak there was well studied in recent publications [5, 6] .Diamond Princess had carried total of 3711 people, which translates into a very high local population density of ~26500 persons/km 2 . This is roughly 3 times higher than the most populous country, Singapore, and, apparently this has resulted in a steep infection rate. Nevertheless, by the time disembarkation on March 1 st 2020, only approximately 20% of people onboard were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.Despite a very unusual environment, the model handled this case perfectly well. Most datasets were producing a forecast exactly reproducing the reported dynamics (Fig. 4, top) .In one particular curious case, if just one extra day was omitted from the model, it predicted a sharp rise in the infection rates, up to 97% of the total passengers (Fig. 4, bottom) . We prefer to think of this scenario as an artefact of a non-linear system subjected to unnatural conditions (high population density), but it also highlights the theoretically possible outcomes..

South Korea

South Korea is another interesting case, with a kink in the S-curve. The model was not able to reproduce this kink, but it was consistent in predicting ~10000 of total cases, flattening at the end of March 2020 (Fig. 5) . It appears that the models might behave quite unpredictably depending on the selection of the start day in the flat initial region, when the fluctuation in the rates is high. Therefore, one has to run the simulation for a range of start dates (say, from the very beginning to the visible bend in the S-curve), and then derive the conclusion based on the most frequent scenarios. As it is demonstrated below, some countries are more stable than other.

Congruent countries: New Zealand, Italy, Spain

Apparently, for certain countries, which have advanced well up on their S-curve, the model produces stable solutions. The solutions have certain spread in maximal cases and in the bend date, but this spread could be considered acceptable. .

Chaotic countries: Singapore, Sweden, India, USA

For the countries, which appear to be in the very beginning (flat portion) of their S-curves, the model demonstrates a very unstable behaviour. For example, for India it predicts the total number of cases anywhere from 13,000 to almost the whole population (Fig. 9) . The countries in this category are very diverse in terms of climate, governmental practices, and societal norms. So, for the time being the possible solution would be to wait until the number of cases in each such country yields a convergent forecast. The good news is that for each of the chaotic scenarios, the bending point is in not-so-distant future (for India it ranges from the beginning of June to middle of October 2020). .

Conclusions

The presented model for Covid-19 progression has demonstrated good performance on the finished cases (China and Diamond Princess liner). It appears that it is capable to detect the countries, which are well advanced on the S-curve, and close to the plateau. For these countries the model produces stable solutions regardless of the starting conditions. If the solutions demonstrate chaotic behaviour, it might be an indicator that the country is in the very beginning of its local epidemy. General recommendation in this case would be to rebuild the model periodically, as the new cases are reported, until the forecast curves are converged with an acceptable spread.

"Abstract

Several French regions where COVID19 has been reported currently show a renewed increase in ILI cases in the general practice based Sentinelles network. Here we computed the number of excess cases by region and found correlation with the number of reported COVID19 cases so far. These data suggest larger circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the French population than apparent from confirmed cases.

","

Influenza Like illnesses cases are defined as cases with fever of sudden onset (>39°C) with respiratory signs (cough, running nose) and myalgia of any age. Acute Respiratory Infection (AIR) include diseases with respiratory signs and are only monitored in the > 65 y.o. Cases are reported in real time by participating GPs (approx. 600 GPs) all over France. Additionally, Sentinelles GPs may swab 1 ILI case and up to 2 IRA cases per week for viral characterization (3) . Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus are routinely looked for, and SARS-CoV-2 has been added since February 2020.We computed the expected number of ILI consultations using the superposition of a seasonal (4) and an influenza epidemic component (5) , as detailed in the appendix. Excess cases were computed as the difference between observed cases and expected numbers. The rate of increase in excess cases was determined, assuming exponential growth.Confirmed COVID19 cases were obtained from the santé Publique France website, March 7 Bulletin(6).

SARS-CoV2 positive swabs in ILI and ARI cases.

In week 10 of 2020, 93 swabs were collected in ILI patients and 23 in ARI patients. Two (2) swabs in each category were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The 2 positive swabs in ARI patients had been collected in In Bourgogne-Franche Comté (BFC) and Grand Est (GRE) regions, out of a total of 7 swabs in these 2 regions. Assuming a positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 of 2/7 in these regions, we estimated that 760 (CI95% [219, 1706]) ARI consultations in the > 65 y.o. could have been caused by COVID19 during week 10 (2/7 of 2600 ARI visits). One of the positive ILI case was linked to an existing cluster in the east of France.

Analysis of ILI incidence

The modelling approach allowed computing excess cases in 11 out of 13 regions. The model did not provide a good fit in the remaining 2 regions (see appendix). The overall ILI incidence showed renewed increase with 33 [-8, 64] consultations/100000 in excess during week 9 and 84 [447, 108] consultations/100000 in excess in week 10. This changed with regions: 4/11 regions displayed positive excess (credible interval excluding 0) in week 9 and 7/11 regions in week 10. 

Interpretation

In the last 30 seasons of routine surveillance in France with the Sentinelles network, this is the first time that an increase in ILI cases is observed simultaneously in several regions after the peak of the annual influenza epidemic.Several processes may be at play in this observation, including at least characteristics of the influenza season, change in population behaviour or increase in COVID19 incidence.

H1N1pdm and B influenza viruses co-circulated in 2019-20 in France. Seasons with the type B virus

can lead to prolonged periods for decrease in incidence but a renewed increase has never occurred before (1). The school holidays occurred gradually in France during the end of February and earlyMarch. While this may change the dynamics of influenza (7), the effect is generally notable in the ascending phase of the epidemic rather than after the peak.The current situation with COVID19 may change the health-seeking behaviour of patients and, to some extent, of the contributing general practitioners although they conform to a case definition.Preliminary assessment of behavioural data in crowdsourced surveillance system is under way (grippenet.fr(8)) but, as of today, no massive trend towards more consultations has been observed.As information regarding the coronavirus risk is widespread, a uniform increase over all regions could have been expected in this scenario, but we acknowledge that it may have led to increased consultation rates in regions where COVID19 is the most reported.The overlap between COVID19 and flu symptoms makes it possible that the excess of ILI cases is due to COVID19 cases, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 positive swabs in the patients demonstrate this possibility. The correlation between the number of confirmed cases and the computed excess is also consistent with this scenario. In this case, the excess in cases is compatible with an exponential growth with rate estimated at approximately 0.7/week. Interestingly, this estimate is very similar from one region to the next in the four most affected regions (GRE, IDF, OCC, HDF). This estimate may prove useful to help calibrate models for studying the impact of the COVID19 pandemic.Estimating the true number of COVID19 cases remains difficult in the presence of these uncertainties. We note that the extrapolated number of COVID19 presenting as ARI was 760 in the >65 y.o. in the 2 eastern regions (GRE and BFC), which was at least twice more than the number of reported cases at the time (250+129), all ages confounded.As we enter a period of generalized circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, surveillance based on clinical description and swabbing by GPs will prove essential to help us assess the situation. .

","INTRODUCTION

The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has spread quickly from Wuhan, China to all other major cities in China and is rapidly spreading to a growing number of other countries despite efforts at containment and isolation 1 . The population is generally susceptible to this newly identified coronavirus 2 , initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. Early efforts have focused on describing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 in the general population 1, 3, 4 . However, the disease appears to be particularly impactful in special populations that include those older than sixty-five years of age 5 . Pregnant women are also considered to be a special population group because of the unique 'immune suppression' caused by pregnancy 6 . The immunologic and physiologic changes might make pregnant women at higher risk of severe illness or mortality with Covid-19, compared with the general public. However, there is little information on Covid-19 during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19.

All five hospitals assigned by the government to be responsible for the treatments of pregnant women with Covid-19. The Institutional Review Board of Huazhong University of Science and Technology approved this study (#TJ-IRB20200222). All pregnant women gave informed consent to participate in this study.

LABORATORY CONFIRMATION

Based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China 7 , those with one of the following laboratory evidence is considered to have a confirmed Covid-19 case: (1) positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR); (2) viral gene sequencing showing highly homogeneity to the known SARS-CoV-2. Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed following the protocol established by the WHO 8 .

DATA COLLECTION

We collected data of all pregnant women and newborns from electronic medical records with data collection forms.

STUDY OUTCOMES

The primary composite endpoints were admission to an ICU, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women or newborns.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Patient characteristics were presented using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables were summarized using the mean and standard deviations, while categorical variables were calculated using the frequency and percentage. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

CHARACTERISTICS OF PREGNANT WOMEN

Our retrospective analysis revealed a total of 33 pregnant women with Covid-19 who were admitted to 5 public hospitals in Hubei Province. The maternal age ranged from 24 to 36 years. Among the affected, there were 8 (24.2%) health care workers, and 32 (97%) of women had a history of exposure. Three women were in the second trimester (17 weeks, 20 weeks, and 26 weeks), and the other 30 women were in the third trimester at the time of presentation.Fifteen (45.5%) women had chronic disorders involving cardiovascular and cerebrovascular, digestive, endocrine, and nervous systems, as well as infectious diseases and depressive All rights reserved.

All women received antiviral therapy. Twenty-nine (87.9%) women were given antibiotic treatment, 11 (33.3%) were treated with glucocorticoids, and 12 (36.4%) received traditional Chinese medicine (Table 1) .

MATERNAL OUTCOMES

Twenty-two (81.5%) women delivered via cesarean section, and 5(18.5%) had vaginal deliveries. The overall rate of obstetrical complications was 22.2%, including three cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes, two cases of hypertensive diseases of the pregnancy, two cases of gestational diabetes mellitus, and one case of spontaneous preterm labor.

No pregnant women proceeded to severe complications or were admitted to the ICU, and there was no mortality.

NEONATAL OUTCOMES

There were 28 newborns born to 27 women, ten (35.7%) of whom were delivered preterm.The 1-min Apgar score of all newborns ranged from 8-10. The 5-min Apgar score of all newborns ranged from 9-10. All newborns were isolated after birth and fed by milk formula.Five (17.9%) newborns had low birth weight, and no newborn had very low birth weight.Four (14.3%) newborns were diagnosed with fetal distress. One newborn who was born at 34 weeks of gestation, was transferred to the NICU with a diagnosis of ARDS. At the end of the follow-up, this newborn recovered and was discharged. No newborns had clinical symptoms of Covid-19 or died (Table 3) .At the end of the follow-up, two newborns had not been tested for SARS-CoV-2 because their parents asked to delay the test to 14 days after birth. Twenty-six newborns were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR assays of throat swabs. Among those, one newborn tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus yielding a perinatal transmission rate of 3.6%.The mother of this newborn was sent to the hospital because of a fever. The mother wore N95 masks during the cesarean section. All medical staff wore protective suits. The newborn had no contact with his mother and other family members.

Real-time RT-PCR showed that the mother was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. At the same time, the throat swab sample was taken from the newborn for a nucleic acid test, which also came back positive. In addition, the chest X-ray of the newborn 53 h after birth was consistent with pulmonary infection. However, the cord 

DISCUSSION

In this study, we reported a case series of pregnant women with Covid-19 and newborns born to these women. The primary composite endpoint occurred in one (3%) pregnant woman who needed the use of mechanical ventilation, while no pregnant women admitted to the ICU or died. For the secondary outcomes, the percentages of pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and 1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. There were no moralities among newborns.There is limited knowledge regarding Covid-19 that occurs during pregnancy.

The clinical outcomes among pregnant women with SARS or MERS were worse than those occurring in non-pregnant women 6, 10 . However, our data suggest the contrary to Covid-19. Among the 33 pregnant women with confirmed Covid-19, 39.4% of women presented mild, 57.6% presented moderate, and 3% presented with severe symptoms. For most pregnant women (87.9%), oxygen therapy supplied via a nasal cannula or mask was sufficient for supportive care. Only one (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. At the end of the follow-up, no pregnant women had severe complications or needed to be transferred to the ICU or died. Compared with the general population, in which 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died 12 , it seems that the severity and mortality rate of Covid-19 in pregnant women are lower.The risk of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was low, as only one out of 26 newborns was confirmed to have a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our study, this newborn's SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by the detection of virus in throat swab and chest X-ray abnormalities. However, we cannot prove that this is a case of vertical transmission because the cord blood and placental samples were both negative for SARS-CoV-2.How SARS-CoV-2 invades the human body remains a mystery. Xu et al. first reported that SARS-CoV-2 shares 76.47% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV, and may use the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry into target host cells 13 .Zhao et al. found that ACE2 is specifically expressed in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT2) in human lung, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may target ACE2-positive AT2 cells to induce All rights reserved.

Further studies showed that ACE2 protein is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine 15 , heart 16 , arterial smooth muscle cells, gastrointestinal system, renal tubules of kidney 17 and testes 18 , suggesting potential routes for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urinary and male reproductive systems. Thus, this newborn could have been infected from many possible paths, such as via the respiratory system.However, this newborn's case may also be real vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 since the mother wore N95 masks during the cesarean section, and all medical staff wore protective suits. Furthermore, the newborn was isolated immediately after birth. These preventive measures should have decreased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the respiratory system of the mother, medical staff, and hospital environment. Second, previous studies have shown that ACE2 is expressed by the human endometrium and placenta 19, 20 . A recent study revealed that ACE2 is highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells, including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta 21 . Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may also be attracted to the human endometrium and placenta though ACE2, causing vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Also, the SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in urine and stool 22 , suggesting a possibility of ascending infection of the uterus, placenta, and fetus. Third, it has been reported that the ACE2-expressing cell ratio is variable between individuals, which may explain why some people are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 14 . This characteristic of ACE2 may explain why SARS-CoV-2 infected only one out of 26 newborns.Another novelty of our study, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of infected All rights reserved.

In our study, we included three women in the second trimester and 30 women in the third trimester at presentation.Among the 33 women, 27 women delivered 28 newborns, and the live birth rate was 100%.Five women had ongoing pregnancy without severe obstetrical complications at the time of manuscript preparation. The overall rate of obstetrical complications was 22.2%, including three cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes, two cases of hypertensive diseases of the pregnancy, two cases of gestational diabetes mellitus, and one case of spontaneous preterm labor. Therefore, the obstetrical outcomes from pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection appear better than that for pregnant women with SARS.

"Abstract

The spread of COVID-19 engulfs almost all the countries and territories of the planet, and infections and fatality are increasing rapidly. The first epi-center of its' massive spread was in Wuhan, Hubei province, China having a temperate weather, but the spread has got an unprecedented momentum in European temperate countries mainly in Italy and Spain (as of March 30, 2020). However, Malaysia and Singapore and the neighboring tropical countries of China got relatively low spread and fatality that created a research interest on whether there are potential impacts of weather condition on COVID-19 spread. Adopting the SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) deviated model to predict potential cases and death in the coming days from COVID-19 was done using the secondary and official sources of data. This study shows that COVID-19 spread and fatality tend to be high across the world but compared to tropical countries, it is going to be incredibly high in the temperate countries having lower temperature (7-16°C) and humidity (80-90%) in last March. However, some literature predicted that this might not to be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a continuous spread and death. Moreover, a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in both temperate and tropical countries may re-outbreak in the coming winter. Therefore, a comprehensive global program with the leadership of WHO for testing of entire population of the world is required, which will be very useful for the individual states to take proper political action, social movement and medical services.

","Introduction

After the incidence of some mysterious SARS-like cluster pneumonia, cases with unknown aetiology on December Wuhan, the center of coronavirus easing of its' 'City Closure' situation after a lap of two months since 23 January, 2020 for successful attempts of the Chinese Government (7,8), when the other countries have newly been imposed the lockdown for uncertain period of time. The recent claim of China that the new COVID-19 cases essentially to zero has become possible for their quick action of test widely to isolate infected ones, stunted peoples' unpopular movement except to get food and medical care, prohibit the leaving of own cities even homes of people and more importantly accepting the deep economy damage shut downed whole processing industry. The peak and quick recovery of the China made relax the rest of the world particularly the European countries. Moreover, Government of European countries' emphasize attitude towards public opinion for being of affluent democracies and peoples' free movement, easy travel and independent decision-making, which is now paying a price by counting 100,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 5,000 deaths with high fatality rate each dayexpecting that the worst is yet to come (9).By defying the geographical and political boundaries of western and temperate countries (like Italy, Spain, UK, USA etc.) the novel coronavirus has invaded towards tropical countries, excluding only a fewer than two dozen countries on the earth where there are no COVID-19 cases reported, so far. However, growth rate of conformed cases and fatalities are apparently slower in Asian tropical countries (like Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand etc.) than that of European temperate countries (10). This gap might be due to tropical countries with moderate economy are tended to be resource poor, not capable to do regular testing or there might be an impact of tropical weather to reduce the pandemic nature COVID-19, rather be a panic. A number of studies (11,12) argued that higher temperature and high relative humidity reduce the spreading capacity of new coronavirus to a greater extent, while there it would be popped again in 2020-2021 winter season (13). Researchers along with epidemiological experts also predicting COVID-19 cannot take advantage and bridgehead in the tropics than in the world's temperate regions (14) . A spatial analysis conducted by a research team from University of Maryland revealed that the transmission of COVID-19 lies mostly the regions across the equator where temperature ranges between 05-11°C with the combination of low specific (3-6 g/kg) and absolute humidity (4-7 g/m 3 ) (15).Depending on this complex context of COVID-19, this study is outlined to unpack the answers of the following research questions and formulate some recommendations to minimize the spread of COVID-19..

Methods

Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease an exhaustive literature review related to the different aspects of COVID-19 and its' relationships with different climatologic parameters and further forecasting was carried out. Published manuscripts, reports from different competent authorities, database and other documents on key areas of COVID-19 in different parts of the world were identified through searches in online journal sources and other available electronic sources.

Model adopted

The proposed SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) deviated model developed by Choi and Pak (16) during the outbreak of SARS on 2003, was adopted in this study to make a prediction about the suspected cases and death from being the onset of COVID-19. The COVID-19 transmission pattern from person-to-person, no pint source nature and negligible amount of immunity development by the exposure patient during the inaugural stage of COVID-19 pandemic is more likely to SARS epidemic. Therefore, the same model was adopted using the same four available parameters basic reproduction number (R0), case fatality rate (F), incubation period (i) and duration of disease (d) regarding COVID-19 revealed by other researchers..

COVID-19 cases prediction

Basic reproductive number (R0) and incubation period (i) requires to play this model. Any disease become epidemic in any population of a geographical area by increasing the secondary cases from a single (typical) infection in that complete susceptible population is termed as basic reproduction number (17). And the incubation period is the time laps between initial infection and disease onset (18). The R0 will be changed by the increasing of i. Following the first incubation period, the total number of cases will be 1+ R0 for being the producing of R0 new cases from the single infectious case at the very beginning of the disease forming its' epidemic nature. This will follow the quadrilateral nature in the subsequent periods of incubation and the total cases will be as 1 + (1 + R0) + (1 + R0 + R0 2 ) + …………. + (1 + R0 + R0 2 + ……… + R0 i ).If we consider C as the total number of predicted cases, then on t·i days the predicted number of incidents will be Ct·i. Predicted total cases (C) of COVID-19 was calculated following the modified equation of Choi and Pak, (2003). ∁ = 1 + (1 + 0 ) + (1 + 0 + 0 2 ) + … … … + (1 + 0 + 0 2 + … … … + 0 i ) = ∑ ∁ t·i ---------------------(i) Equation (i) was tested by taking imaginary value of R0 =5 and i = 5 days that predict that on day 15 there will be 125 new cases with the resulting of total 156 cases (Table 1) .

COVID-19 death prediction

Like the case prediction of any epidemic disease, death prediction can also be done by a model using some parameters like basic reproductive number (R0), incubation period (i), duration of disease (d) and case fatality rate (F). Among these the first two is same of the case prediction model. Duration of disease (d) is the average time to diagnose people either cured or die. In more simple words maximum days to onset symptoms of the disease and if not disease diagnosed .

Therefore, the predicted total number of deaths isA trial was done for equation (ii) with the same value taken for equation (i) and taking the value for F = 20% and d = 14 days. The attempt reveals the prediction that first 0.2 persons will die from day 0 cases on day 14. Cases from day 5 will give 1 new death prediction with a total 1.2 persons' death on day 19 (Table 2 ).

The disease duration for COVID-19 has been set 14 days by WHO (28) used in this study. This means the case from day 0 will be recovered or dead on day 14. Similarly, from second incubation period i.e. patient from day 5 recovered or dead on day 19 and so on. Case fatality rate (F) values of COVID-19 is differed in different studies (29) (30) (31) , however to avoid the regional confinement, here in this study WHO reported COVID-19 case fatality rate (F) 3.4% (3) was used. This pointed that the death from the cases day 0 is 0.034 (1×3.4%) on day 14, as opposed to be recovered 0.966 people. The values of R0 and i selected in the was well adjusted with d and F values selected from WHOs' report.In case of determining the prediction for sub-tropical and tropical countries the incubation period (i) and duration of disease (d) values kept same, as these values do not vary by geographical variation for any kind of infectious disease (32) . For basic reproduction number (R0) and fatality rate (F) the values revealed by different regional researchers were collected, checked with the i and d value for adjustment and finalized (Table 3) .

Data source and data analysis

It was required two different types of data. Since for the prediction of daily new cases and deaths from COVID-19 the data from the official website of WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) and Center for Systems Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, USA (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) were used. The weather data of temperate and tropical countries were gathered from authentic website of Weather Atlas (https://www.weather-atlas.com).

COVID-19 scenario of the tropical countries and sub-tropical countries

During the writeup of this study Italy and Spain are the two most vulnerable sub-tropical countries selected for this study to tale the COVID-19 incidental difference between sub-tropical and tropical countries. After the exact one-month laps of the first incidence of COVID-19 the deadly virus in Wuhan, China; the first reported case in for both Italy and Spain was on January 31, 2020. The result is presented of 90 days, while there is arrayed comparative results of predicted and observed for two months and another one month only predicted results. Predicted cases of both Italy and Spain was same as we used the same basic reproduction value for being of the countries from the same temperate and geographical position. However, the predicted total death varies across the countries as the fatality rate was not same (Table 5 and CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint (Table 8 ).

Discussion

The number of predicted cases and death was very much resembled after a certain time interval with that of the actual number of cases and death for both global and regional population, however it has some unexpected difference. Actual forecasting like ""How many people will be affected onset by the following days"" or ""The outbreak going to be peak or not in the coming month?"" of an epidemic disease from a transmission dynamics based model is quite tough (33). This is because the transmission dynamics based model is developed foothold on the official clinical surveillance data, which comes through a bureaucratic reporting chain of public health officials and government employees (34) who have to maintain privacy concern owing to geographical resolutions. Moreover, human (host) social behavior (35), potential changes in the pathogen (36) and host-pathogen interaction (37) dominates the epidemic models to a greater extent, while these are continuously change within an epidemic period. In case of COVID-19 the prediction from this study can be rippled for being down warding the basic reproduction value, which is already slowed from 2.9 to 2.4 (26) and also of the fatality rate which must be slow downed on the coming days for taking effective measure by the affected countries.Using the existing value of different parameters and incorporated the values in the epidemic model we revealed an estimation of global total cases (2286404188) and death numbers .

The prediction of these researchers will be close to half of our prediction including China if it continues to April 29, 2020, the end date until which we continued our prediction.The COVID-19 transmission shows a different trend of spread between the European temperate and Asian tropical countries. Though the first incident time has a gap of about one month, however the scenario between the countries of these two climatic regions has a head and tail difference. European countries is suffocating from the current COVID-19, a uncontrollable situation given applying modern medical facilities for their citizens by ensuring 11.5 critical care beds per 100,000 head of population (42) comparing with the only 3.6 critical care beds per 100,000 population in the entire Asian countries. The problem for European countries specifically in Italy and Spain is that they are getting 8.5 and 8.9 confirmed COVID-19 cases against per critical care bed (43), which is bounding them to take impossible choice of setting age limit for access to critical care bed. Though the European countries followed the same lockdown, test-trace-isolate infected ones', social distance strategy to defeat COVID-19 like .

Experts now also raised question about the effectuated tests quantity as well as quality variation between the two parts of the world when facing the same problem.Moreover, there is criticism from the expert community for the individualistic hedonists of the Europeans, that dared the Government authorities to impose social distance or self-quarantine, which was quite easy in Asian countries for community-driven, and hierarchical nature of political and administrative intuitions. Not like war, the real war against pandemic COVID-19 the Europe's 27 centers of decision and 27 lines of command also lambaste by their own parliament member (44).Concerning to climatic pattern, there is also vice-versa prediction from the scientist and epidemiologist communities. Expert opinion is that the Asian countries is taking advantage from onset spring and will be favored on door knocking summer from COVID-19 cold shock for their geographical position and climatic condition. Lowen and Stell (45) argued that the dropletmediated viral disease (SARS and MARS) survived in low absolute humidity (cold and dry weather) and attenuated the viral transmission in high absolute humidity (warm and humid weather), which can also be true for their genetic cousin COVID-19. However, Luo et al., (46) burst a vigilant caution that, the increasing temperature and humidity on the onset summer cannot hold back the COVID-19 transmission race too early. If anyhow the transmission is settled down in temperate countries taking the favor of high temperature and humidity, then Neher et al., (13) warned for having the chance of larger peak in the winter of 2020/21. Moreover, given the condition of very low spreads and fatality in the tropical countries, tend to be developing countries having very poor capacity of diagnosis and medical services, if the .

Conclusions and recommendations

Based on the analysis of secondary data in a predictive model, it was found that the that COVID-19 spread and fatality tend to be high globally but compared to tropical countries, it is going to be incredibly high in the temperate countries for having lower temperature (7-16°C) and humidity (80-90%). However, some literature predicted that this might not be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in everywhere in the world particularly in the developing countries which have limited capacity of diagnosis and medical service, will be unknown unless the entire population is diagnosed. The asymptotic career might be the cause of outbreak in the coming winter while whether will be again favorable for COVID-19 incubation in both tropics of the world. Therefore, a comprehensive program with the leadership of WHO for testing of entire population of the world is required, which will be very useful for the individual government of member states of the United Nations to take proper political action and social and medical service.Specific and effective actions as recommended by WHO, UNICEF, CDC and ISGlobal (47) (48) (49) (50) could be implemented to minimize the predicted COVID-19 moves are as follows..

"Abstract

Objective: HIV infection and aging are both associated with neurodegeneration.However, whether the aging process alone or other factors associated with advanced age account for the progression of neurodegeneration in the aging HIV-positive (HIV+) population remains unclear.Methods: HIV+ (n=70) and HIV-negative (HIV-, n=34) participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and metrics of microstructural properties were extracted from regions of interest (ROIs). A support vector regression model was trained on two independent datasets of healthy adults across the adult life-span (n=765, Cam-CAN = 588; UiO = 177) to predict participant age from DTI metrics, and applied to the HIV dataset. Predicted brain age gap (BAG) was computed as the difference between predicted age and chronological age, and statistically compared between HIV groups.Regressions assessed the relationship between BAG and HIV severity/medical comorbidities. Finally, correlation analyses tested for associations between BAG and cognitive performance.Results: BAG was significantly higher in the HIV+ group than the HIV-group F (1, 103) = 12.408, p = 0.001). HIV RNA viral load was significantly associated with BAG, particularly in older HIV+ individuals (R 2 = 0.29, F(7, 70) = 2.66, p = 0.021). Further, BAG was negatively correlated with domain-level cognitive function (learning: r = -0.26, p = 0.008; memory: r = -0.21, p = 0.034).

","INTRODUCTION

Advanced age is a major risk factor for cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, including deterioration of white matter (WM) throughout the brain 1, 2, 3 . Older adults with HIV infection are at increased risk for cognitive decline 4, 5 and WM neurodegeneration 6, 7, 8 . Importantly, the effects of age can be augmented by factors associated with severity of HIV infection and medical comorbidities which may influence the trajectory of HIV infection and cognitive and brain aging.Neuroimaging-based estimates of the deviance between an individual's chronological age and predicted brain age -termed brain age gap (BAG) -are sensitive to augmented and/or accelerated brain aging 9, 10 . While no current study has investigated BAG in WM microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), recently, using brain volume, Cole and colleagues 9 demonstrated that BAG in the volume of brain grey and white matter is greater in HIV-infected individuals than in HIV-controls.Although no significant relationships between BAG and nadir CD4+ or HIV disease duration were reported, the authors investigated white matter volume, rather than white matter microstructure (using DTI) and in a sample of HIV+ participants with undetectable viral loads. Thus, it is unclear to which degree findings of ""attenuated brain aging"" in HIV 9, 11,12 may be mediated by primary or secondary processes related to the infection. It is also unclear what effects these processes may have on WM microstructure. Therefore, this study sought to expand on previous findings by investigating the predicted-BAG in WM microstructure using DTI metrics of white matter patency. This project also sought to further elucidate the effect of HIV severity indices and non-HIV-related medical comorbidities on accentuated WM aging..

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 Kuhn, T., Ph.D. 5 Here, we used a machine learning approach to quantify brain aging based on DTI. A support vector machine model trained in a large and independent training-set of healthy controls was used to predict age in HIV+ and comparable HIV-individuals. We tested for group differences in BAG between HIV+ and HIV-, and for associations with cognitive function and HIV disease factors as well as medical comorbidities within the HIV+ group. We converted raw test scores into within-sample z scores and then averaged them to create neurocognitive domain z scores. We calculated the global neurocognition score by averaging the z scores from all of the neuropsychological test variables. Given that the relationship between age and neurocognitive performance in HIV is a primary aim of this study, within-sample z scores were computed instead of demographically-adjusted T scores. IMMUNE STATUS ASSESSMENT: In the testing dataset, HIV+ participants selfreported nadir CD4+ and lifetime highest viral load were used to assess past immune status. Participants also underwent venipuncture to test current CD4+ and HIV viral load. HIV duration was calculated as the number of years since the participant's selfreported HIV diagnosis. Next, participants were classified as either 'pre-HAART' (highly active antiretroviral therapy) or 'post-HAART' based on whether their initial HIV diagnosis was before or after 1996 24 . Further, a ""medical comorbidity burden' index score was computed from the medical history taken during the routine interview all participants completed during data collection. Participants were assigned a '1' if they endorsed a history of each of the following medical conditions: cerebrovascular risk factors including hypertension, heart failure, COPD, anemia, diabetes; endocrine dysfunction including thyroid disease, testosterone therapy, estrogen therapy; kidney disease. Participants were assigned a '0' for all medical conditions they did not endorse. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The 'medical comorbidity burden' score was then computed as a sum of these conditions, resulting in a scale ranging from 0 (no medical comorbidities) to 9 (endorsed all medical comorbidities identified).

MRI ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS

Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) scans were collected from HIV+ individuals and demographically-matched HIV-seronegative controls at the University of California, Los Angeles, all of whom comprised the testing dataset. This MR data was collected using a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Only the b=0 and b=1000 shells were used for DTI analysis in the present study. All DWI images were quality controlled and visually inspected prior to being preprocessed and analyzed.DWI scans from UCLA, UiO and Cam-CAN were processed simultaneously through the same pipeline to harmonize imaging methods across sites. All imaging data were processed using FMRIB software Library 25 (FSL, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk.fsl).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

GROUP DEMOGRAPHICS: Participant characteristics (e.g. age, education, past drug use) between HIV+ and HIV-groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Group differences in dichotomous factors (e.g. sex, ethnicity, urinalysis results) were assessed using chi-square analyses. We used p< .05 as our cutoff for statistical significance for these demographic analyses.AGE PREDICTION AND BRAIN AGE GAP: UiO and Cam-CAN data were used to train a support vector regression model (SVR) to predict participant age using FA, L1, RD and MD from atlas-derived ROIs (the exact same regions described above 29, 30, 31 ) as features. Similar methods have been employed using imaging data previously 9, 10, 32, including using DTI to assess participant age in a healthy cohort 33 . SVR was conducted in Matlab (https://mathworks.com/help/stats/fitrsvm.html) using the implementation ""fitrsvm"" with a linear kernel, automatic hyperparameter tuning and Sequential Minimal Optimization. Given that multiple MR scanners were used to collect the HIV and training data, scanner was used as a regressor on the features to control for interscanner variability. The model accuracy was validated using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set. After successful validation, the trained SVR was used to predict age of participants in the independent UCLA sample (HIV+ / HIV-). For each individual, BAG was computed by subtracting the participant's predicted brain age by their chronologic .

DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP COMPARISON

In the test dataset, the HIV+ and HIV-seronegative groups did not significantly differ on age, years of education, ethnicity, or sex ( Table 1 ). The HIV+ group had significantly higher medical comorbidity burden (i.e. greater number of medical comorbidities) than the HIV-control group (χ 2 = 7.39, p = 0.007). None of the participants tested positive for barbiturates, cocaine, methamphetamine, phencyclidine, or MDMA. Significantly more HIV+ participants tested positive for prescribed benzodiazepines (χ 2 = 5.93, p = 0.015) .

The HIV serostatus groups did not differ on current alcohol or substance abuse, past (i.e. self-reported lifetime) substance dependence, past substance abuse, past alcohol dependence or past alcohol abuse (all p's > 0.10).Participants were not included in the study if they reported previous methamphetamine abuse or dependence.Within the HIV+ group, participants diagnosed in the pre-HAART era were In the testing dataset, HIV+ individuals showed higher differences between their brain age and their chronological age than HIV-counterparts (F (1, 103) = 12.408, p = 0.001, partial η 2 = 0.21). As participant chronologic age increased, BAG also increased (F (39, 103) = 5.57, p = 0.010, partial η 2 = 0.37). There was no age*HIV interaction on BAG (p > 0.05).

DISCUSSION

This study used machine learning along with a large training data set of normal WM aging to examine HIV-associated WM microstructural alterations and related this WM degeneration to cognitive impairment. Using an SVR trained with this healthy aging cohort to reliably predict participant age based on metrics of WM microstructure, we found that the brain WM age difference (BAG) was significantly higher in our HIV+ group than in the highly comparable HIV-group. Further, BAG widened with increasing age, suggesting that advancing age is a risk factor for neurodegeneration. Additionally, larger BAG was associated with worse cognitive performance, indicating that this .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint 15 Kuhn, T., Ph.D. 15 neurodegeneration may be related to deleterious changes in cognition. Although chronological age was not significantly correlated with prediction error, confirmatory analyses verified that these significant associations between BAG and cognitive performance remained after controlling for participant true age.Importantly, in our sample in which 11% of the HIV+ participants evidenced a detectable HIV RNA viral load, current CD4 and detectable viral load were not related to BAG. Conversely, highest lifetime HIV RNA viral load, which was not the current viral load for any participant, was related to BAG in the HIV+ group, even after controlling for factors such as HIV duration, pre-versus post-HAART diagnosis and medical comorbidities. Highest lifetime viral load also was not different between the younger and older HIV+ groups. Furthermore, older HIV+ participants who reported high plasma viral load had the greatest discrepancy between their estimated brain age and chronological age, suggesting that history of high viral burden contributes to accentuated brain aging.These findings suggest that the impact of early disease burden, even among a sample comprised of 11% of participants with currently detectable HIV RNA viral load, has adverse effects on brain/cognition as HIV+ individuals age. This provides further support of previous findings 9, that demonstrated this augmented aging effect in a sample with no participants with detectable HIV RNA. The relationship of the past plasma viral load to current brain reservoirs of HIV are not known, and we can only speculate that persons with a higher plasma viral burden in blood may have also acquired more viral seeding in brain; this may be the stimulus for greater neuroinflammation and more neurodegeneration over years of exposure. Taken together, these findings may suggest . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint Kuhn, T., Ph.D. 16 that HIV is associated with an augmented aging process in WM which is itself associated with lower cognitive performance.The mechanisms by which HIV and age result in augmented neurodegeneration are unclear. Holt and colleagues 6 suggest two potential explanations regarding the relationship between HIV infection and increased brain aging. First, the increased brain age (BAG) may be explained by premature WM aging resulting from the virus facilitating neurodegenerative processes 35 , such as axonal injury, loss of axonal density, reduced patency of axons. Alternatively, advanced age may increase the effects of the virus on the CNS, thereby creating a synergistic interaction effect between HIV and aging 6 . Our finding that lifetime highest HIV RNA viral load, particularly in the context of advanced chronological age, was related to augmented WM aging (i.e. BAG) supports the first hypothesis. In line with this hypothesis, HIV effects on the brain have been shown to occur via similar cellular mechanisms as normal aging 36 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint volume 9 . Similar to that reported by Cole et al., we did not find significant relationships between WM BAG and Nadir CD4 or HIV duration. Our findings expand upon these previous results by providing data suggesting the mechanism through which this augmented aging process deleteriously affects WM microstructure. Our results also further the literature in that we found a significant relationship between BAG and peak HIV RNA viral load as well as a significant age*peak viral load interactive effect on BAG, indicating that the effects of disease burden on brain integrity are more pronounced with advanced age.Further, these findings indicate the significant advantages of using BAG to predict HIV-associated white matter aging over other methods. The BAG findings were much stronger than our conventional age-trajectory findings, indicating that the SVRbased brain age approach we used is a sensitive approach to reveal group differences beyond simple differences in mean DTI measures. Additionally, BAG outperformed each individual DTI metric in its ability to discriminate between HIV+ and HIVparticipants and demonstrate the effect of HIV infection on advancing brain white matter age. BAG also may be more useful than, or at the very least a meaningful compliment to, hyper/hypo-intense lesion volume and count which has been shown to relate to HIV infection and cognitive performance, but not to HIV clinical variables or HIV-associated aging 41, 42, 43 . Additionally, BAG is a relatively easy metric to understand and thus it circumvents the cumbersome and difficult to interpret multivariate score often used with DTI metrics which are inherently difficult to connect to clinical variables. In contrast, BAG was successfully and clearly connected to both HIV clinical variables (e.g. HIV RNA viral load) and neurocognitive performance. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint It is important to consider these findings also in the context of the psychosocial stressors and associated comorbidities associated with living with HIV. For example, the HIV+ sample evidenced greater rates of comorbidities, both medical (which were included in the model herein) and psychiatric (e.g. depression, which was not included in the model). It is unclear in the literature to what extent depression is a secondary reaction to living with HIV or is a neurologic symptom of the predominantly frontalsubcortical clinical profile of the disease. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the augmented aging findings are related directly and solely to the effects of the HIV virus on the brain or if they are also related to secondary effects of these HIV-associated increased comorbidities. This is particularly worthy of follow up investigation given that depressive disorders are the most prevalent mental health disorders associated with HIV 44 and studies have shown that depression can be associated with neurodegeneration and increased brain age 45 .There are limitations of the current study worth noting. First, the cross-sectional nature of this study hinders our ability to make inferences about the rates of neuroanatomic changes in HIV. Importantly, this limited our ability to determine whether our findings relate to a more static, vestigial process which adds to or augments the aging process in HIV, or whether in fact these results are related to a dynamic, accelerated aging process. This is an important distinction and clinically meaningful question, particularly as the HIV+ population continues to age in the post-HAART era, and must be addressed using a longitudinal model. A recent longitudinal publication 45 demonstrated that HIV+ participants demonstrated greater predicted brain age than HIV-controls when analyzed at cross-section. However, when followed longitudinally, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint the HIV+ and HIV-groups evidenced comparable rates of change in neuroimaging markers, suggesting that, when receiving successful treatment, people living with HIV are not at risk for accelerated brain aging over two years. Longer longitudinal studies will help clarify whether or not this pattern remains steady over time.Next, the SVR-modeling of the DTI data appeared to be less accurate (MAE = 7.39 years) than that using T1-MRI to measure brain volume (MAE = 5.01 years) 9 . This could be due to differences in the neuroimaging methodology used (e.g. size, variability and number of features of training sample set). However, it is also the case that we sought to test a different biological entity (DTI-based WM microstructure), and as such a direct comparison between SVR-derived brain ages may not be appropriate, as Cole et al sought to determine a best-predicted brain age based on grey/white matter volume and we sought to determine the best-predicted age of WM microstructure.. The fact that data was acquired at multiple sites using different MR scanner could be a factor and a limitation. However, scanner was included as a variable in the model and the data was homogenized using a single, uniform processing pipeline which has become an accepted standard of practice in the field and indeed has been used in similar machine learning papers 9, 10 where the training data and the disease-specific data were collected at separate sites using different scanners and non-identical scanning parameters. Therefore, this is a limitation of note but one whose impact on the findings was minimized to the best of our abilities. Additionally, although the TBSS method applied should limit the impact of atrophy on our findings, this study did not employ any specific control regarding possible WM lesions. Given that WM lesions have been reported in the brains of HIV+ patients, it is possible that our prediction of WM age could .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint 20 Kuhn, T., Ph.D. 20 be improved had we included WM lesions from any affected patient in the model.Further, there are some inherent demographic differences (e.g. race/ethnicity) in the training datasets (from England and Norway) and the test dataset (from Los Angeles).While we attempted to control for these by comparing our UCLA HIV+ participants to UCLA HIV-participants who were highly matched on demographic variables and assessing the effect of race/ethnicity on the outcomes, it remains possible that such demographic or even genetic variables could contribute to our findings, though we believe this is less likely for several reasons including the SVR model fit statistics and similar findings from Cole et al. 9 Further, there are some limits to the generalizability of this study. These include the exclusion of participants with substance use disorders and Axis I diagnoses, the (although non-significant) fact that our sample included fewer HIV+ women, and the fact that the older HIV+ adults are long term survivors from the pre-HAART era and may not be representative of HIV+ adults reaching older age in the near future who were diagnosed in the post-HAART era. Importantly though, it is possible that comorbid substance abuse and/or psychiatric disorders may increase the risk of premature brain aging. Although the current CD4+ and viral load data used in this study were extracted from blood samples collected during the course of this study, nadir CD4+ and highest lifetime viral load were self-reported by participants.Additionally, the DTI-based WM metrics were extracted from the entire white matter skeleton, rather than from individual WM tracts (e.g. uncinate fasciculus). This method limits the spatial resolution of our technique. Future examinations between specific tracts with respect to white matter aging are warranted..

Importantly, neuroimagederived age predictors may indeed be biomarkers of normal and pathologic aging processes. Therefore, this technique may be generalizable to other disease processes which may affect the aging process, including neurodegenerative disorders (e.g.Alzheimer's disease) and other neuro-medical illnesses. This technique may also be useful in identifying patients at risk for cognitive decline, functional limitations, and early mortality 10 ..

"Abstract

The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the end of 2019 in China has triggered a global public health crisis. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the same as SARS-CoV. The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes. Our study revealed the phenomenon and possible cause of mild pancreatic injury in patients with COVID-19. This suggests that pancreatitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection should also be paid attention in clinical work.

","Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) , a novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 in humans, began to occur in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 and has the trend of spreading around the world [1, 2, 3] . By February 28, 2020, a total of 78962 people had been infected in China with 2791 (3.53%) deaths, and 4838 people had been infected with 76 (1.57%) deaths in other countries. It was confirmed by etiology that SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the novel coronavirus of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta-CoV lineage B), and had 79.5% similarity with SARS-CoV [4] , which caused the global outbreak in 2003. Spike (S) protein, one of the main structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein of the host cell membrane to fuse into the cell for nucleic acid replication just similar to SARS-CoV [5] . Through a variety of bioinformatics and experimental verification, ACE2 is not only expressed in alveolar epithelial cells, but also in the heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, testis and other organs, which means that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to enter other tissues and organs through ACE2 binding, causing multiple organ damage [6, 7] .In recent studies, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to cause heart, kidney, liver injury and gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to lung lesions such as ARDS [6] . However, there is lacking attention in pancreatic injury, which may accelerate patients' progression. In our clinical observation, we also found that some patients showed signs of pancreatic injury, such as high levels of amylase and lipase in serum and urine..

Combined with clinical data, we demonstrated the pancreatic injury in some patients with COVID-19, and explained for the first time that the pancreas was also a vulnerable organ after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Analysis of Public datasets

We collected bulk RNA-seq data from GTEx (https://gtexportal.org), which contains normal tissue and organ sequencing data from multiple individuals. The data analysis was performed online. In addition, we collected data from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of the pancreas NCBI-GEO (GSE85241 (4 donors with 2,126 pancreatic cells), GSE84133 (4 donors with 8569 pancreatic cells)). The details of the donors are available in the previous report [8, 9] . The scRNA-seq data processing process is as follows: Unique molecular identified (UMI) expression count matrix was obtained from the database, and Seurat object was created. Further quality control was performed, cells with high mitochondrial gene expression > 5% were filtered. The data was normalized and log-transformed with the method ""LogNormalize"" in NormalizeData function. Before we performed linear dimensional reduction, the data was scaling. And then principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to the data and determined the dimensionality. Finally, after clustering cells based on graph-based clustering approach, the non-linear dimensional reduction based on uniform manifold .

All of scRNA-seq data analysis was based on Seurat R package (version: 3.1.4) with the default parameters [10] . The annotation of cell types was completed based on the featured genes of each cluster and the cell markers of each type pancreas cell from CellMarker database [11] and previously report [8, 9] .

Collections of clinical data

This is a retrospective and observational study from Wuhan Tongji hospital and Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital. We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 to February 15, 2020. The criteria for the diagnosis and severity of the patients were followed by the diagnosis and treatment scheme for COVID-19 (trial version 6) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. We collect hospital admissions, laboratory tests, and imaging tests from clinical electronic medical records. In this study, we collected clinical information including age, gender, amylase and lipase in serum, and the imaging results including bedside ultrasound and abdominal CT. Mild COVID-19 patients with serum amylase and lipase in the normal range did not undergo the imaging evaluation of the pancreas, and their pancreas was assumed to be normal. Bedside ultrasound of the abdomen was all performed in critically ill patients, and CT was added if there were any abnormalities..

Results

To determine the expression of ACE2 in normal pancreas of humans, we used the GTEx database to explore ACE2 expression. We found ACE2 was expressed in many organs or tissues except most brain tissues (Fig. 1A) , which suggests that these organs or tissues such as unreported ovary and thyroid might also be targets for SARS-CoV-2.For comparison, we compared ACE2 expression in lung and pancreatic tissues, since the lung is known to be the first target organ to be attacked by SARS-CoV-2. The mRNA level of ACE2 in pancreas was higher than that in lung ( Fig. 1A , P < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test).To investigate the distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas, we analyzed two scRNA-seq datasets. We identified different types of pancreatic cells, such as alpha cell, beta cell, acinar cell, ductal cell and several other types of cells (Fig. 1B, D) . In GSE85241, ACE2 was expressed in 55 cells (2.59%) among the total 2126 cells, most of which (81.82%) were expressed in exocrine gland (duct cells and acinar cells), and a few (16.36%) were expressed in pancreatic islets (alpha, beta, delta and PP cells) (Fig. 1C , (Fig. 1E , Table 1 ). Individual differences between donors from different sources may lead to differences in the analysis results of the two scRNA-seq datasets. These data still indicate that ACE2 is expressed in both the exocrine glands and islets, which may be the main potential part targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in the pancreas, resulting in .

In mild cases, 1.85% (1/54) of patients showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, while in severe cases, the proportion of increased amylase was 17.91% (12/64) and the proportion of increased lipase was 16.41% (11/64) ( Table 2 ). However, in the imaging evaluation, only 5 severe patients (7.46%) showed changes in the pancreas, mainly focal enlargement of the pancreas or dilatation of the pancreatic duct, without acute necrosis (Fig. 2) . These clinical data show that there exist mild pancreatic lesions in some patients with COVID-19, mainly in severe cases.

SARS-CoV-2 infection is a very serious public health issue. It caused a nationwide

spread in China, and now has the tendency to spread all over the world, causing a surge in infections and deaths [6] . So far, there is no specific drug for SARS-CoV-2, and challenges remain. Although there are asymptomatic infected people, who can also be the source of transmission [1, 12] , in clinical practice, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 mainly suffer from systemic symptoms like fever and fatigue, respiratory symptoms like cough and expectoration, digestive symptoms such as diarrhea [2, 13] . In some patients, especially critically ill cases, damage to other organs, such as the heart, kidneys, and liver, has also been found, which brings great inconvenience to manage patients [2, 14] . As the receptor of SRAS-CoV-2, the .

However, the injury of pancreas has been ignored in clinic, since the symptoms of mild pancreatic injury are not specific to other systemic lesions, such as fever, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.In this study, we focused on the expression of ACE2 in pancreas and the damage to the pancreas in a proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although many previous studies have been reported on the expression of ACE2 tissues and organs [15] , including bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data, this analysis in the pancreas is still lacking. Firstly, we found ACE2 was mostly expressed in the pancreas of normal people, and it was slightly higher in the pancreas than in the lungs, indicating that when SARS-CoV-2 appeared in the circulation, it might also combine with ACE2 in the pancreas to enter cells and cause pancreatic injury. Further, we performed scRNA-seq datasets of the pancreas to explore the localized expression of ACE2 in the pancreas. ACE2 is expressed in both exocrine glands and islets. At the same time, analysis results from scRNA-seq data were consistent with elevated levels of amylase and lipase in the plasma of our patients.In our cases, about 1-2% of the non-severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 had pancreatic lesions, and about 17% of the severe patients suffered from pancreatic injuries, which was not previously noticed. Although their imaging alterations suggested that pancreatitis was not severe, the problem should not be ignored, especially in severe patients. In the clinic, the consequences of pancreatic injury can still be very serious, .

On the other hand, Yang et al. reported that patients infected with SARS-CoV who had never used glucocorticoids suffered from hyperglycemia, which might be caused by SARS-CoV damaging the pancreatic islets through ACE2 [16, 17] . Since SARS-CoV-2 has the same receptor as SARS-COV, whether this result will occur requires more attention.Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the pancreas in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in severe cases.In our study, there are still some limitations. There is no direct evidence that the slight damage to the pancreas was caused by SARS-COV-2 binding to ACE2 in the pancreas, and no studies have shown that nucleic acids of SARS-COV-2 have been detected in the pancreas. Due to the particularity of the location of the pancreas, this study could not be carried out. At present, the body anatomy has been conducted in China, and we hope to see this result in the future. At the same time, the systemic inflammatory response in severe COVID-19 patients might also cause mild damage to the pancreas.However, in the causes of pancreatitis, virus infection factors such as mumps, herpes simplex virus should not be ignored [18] .

Background 33An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia was first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread rapidly to 35 other regions. It has been declared that at least one confirmed case infected by 36 SARS-CoV-2 was found in each province of China by late January 2020. 37We collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, 39 dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China. 40 A simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic 41 epidemic rules of COVID-19.

Introduction 60

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia causing human infection 61 was first identified in Wuhan, a city of Hubei province located in central China with a 62 population of 11 million people (Zhu et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020) . The coronavirus 63 was firstly named as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020 and may have a probable bat 64 origin (Zhou et al., 2020) . Human to human transmission through 2019-nCoV has 65 been confirmed among closed contacts since the middle of December 2019 (Wang et 66 al. 2020; Li et al., 2020) . As of February 12, 2020, infections of 2019-nCoV have been 67 identified in all Chinese provincial administrative regions and in dozens of countries 68 around the world (Munster et al., 2020; Holshue et al, 2020; Ki et al., 2020; 69 Shigemura et al., 2020; Nshiera et al., 2020) . So far, the coronavirus has been 70 renamed as COVID-19 on February 12, 2020 officially. Different from a previous 71 famous beta coronavirus in 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 72 (SARS-CoV) (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Drosten et al., 2003) China. Furthermore, we compared these characteristics with SARS in 2003 using the 81 same model structure in order to validate this model and understand the differences 82 among these two diseases. 83 84 .

Sources of data 86

We obtained the time series data of 2019-nCoV cases from the National Health 87Commission of China, and the provincial Health Commission of 31 provincial 88 administrative regions in Mainland China (January 20 to February 19, 2020). The data 89 used in this study include the number of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, the cumulative 90 number of suspected, dead, and cured cases. All cases were laboratory confirmed 91 following the case definition by national health commission of China (from CCDC 92 website). The basic test procedure has been described in detail in previous work 93 (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) . We only chose the cases that are tested positive 94 by real-time RT-PCR with specific primers and probes to SARS-CoV-2 both at the 95 corresponding provincial CDC and the National Institute for Viral Disease Control at 96 CCDC. We assumed that the population of each region was susceptible to COVID-19, the 105 number of susceptible people per unit time was proportional to the number of 106 uninfected persons, and isolation or closure of the city could affect the spread effect of 107 infected to susceptible people to a certain extent. Previous studies have showed that 108 daily cumulative number of patients could be explained by logistic function (Huang et 109 al., 2003; Wang et al., 2003) . Based on the above assumption and previous studies, we 110 modeled the epidemic information of virus as logistic form (Eq. (1)) 111 .

Fitted curves of 171 provinces such as Jilin and Qinghai has larger value of k, which means that the 172 number of infections peaked earlier in these regions than in other provinces. By 173 contrast, provinces like Hainan, Hebei, Ningxia, has smaller value of k than other 174 provinces, suggesting the infections of these provinces would continue increasing 175 when infections of other provinces reach saturation (Fig 2B) . Fig 2C shows We found the k value of fitted curves of infected SARS cases in Beijing was 0.18, 193 which was much lower than that of Hubei province of COVID-19 (k = 0.25) (Fig 3  194 ABC).

Moreover, the increasing rate (k) was negatively 198 correlated (Pearson, r=-0.47, p=0.0072) to semi-saturation period (Fig 3F) .

We found that k values of the three types 211 cases of SARS were lower than that of COVID-19 (Fig 4 DE) , and semi-saturation 212 period for them in SARS was higher than COVID-19's, which suggested the duration 213 of COVID-19 would be shorter than that of SARS.

The growth of cured cases would again be slow since 252 the number of patients is limited. All these facts were considered in our highly 253 summarized model (Eq. (8) ) in a macroscopic scale.

Discussion 224

We modeled the epidemiologic characteristics of 2019-nCoV for 31 provinces in 225 mainland China based on the data from Jan 20 to Feb 19 during the outbreak. 226Furthermore, we compared these characteristics with SARS in 2003 using the same 227 model framework. 228

229

Compared with dynamical models such as SIR (Susceptible -Infectious -Recovered) 230or SEIR (Susceptible -Exposed -Infectious -Recovered), our model is relatively 231 simple but robust. We used a differential equation in logistic form to describe the 232 dynamics of the infected, dead and healed cases caused by COVID-19 respectively 233 (See Methods). The increasing of the population no matter in which type of case 234 (infection, death or recovery) has multiple reasons. When the outbreak of COVID-19 235 originated in Wuhan, it did not cause too much concern at the beginning so that it 236 leads to many infections and starts to export potential exposed cases to other 237 provinces. But as the successive closure of the cities in Hubei province, and isolation 238 of the community in all the provinces in mainland China, the virus spread tendency 239 was weakened. In our model, we also considered these measures taken by the 240 government. We rewrote Eq. (1) to Eq. (9).

"Abstract

We have analyzed the COVID19 epidemic data of more than 174 countries (excluding China) in the period between January 22 and March 28, 2020. We found that some countries (such as the US, the UK, and Canada) follow an exponential epidemic growth, while others (like Italy and several other European countries) show a power law like growth. At the same time, regardless of the best fitting law, most countries can be shown to follow a trajectory similar to that of Italy, but with varying degrees of delay. We found that countries with ""younger"" epidemics tend to exhibit more exponential like behavior, while countries that are closer behind Italy tend to follow a power law growth. We hypothesize that there is a universal growth pattern of this infection that starts off as exponential and subsequently becomes more power law like. Although it cannot be excluded that this growth pattern is a consequence of social distancing measures, an alternative explanation is that it is an intrinsic epidemic growth law, dictated by a spatially distributed community structure, where the growth in individual highly mixed communities is exponential but the longer term, local geographical spread (in the absence of global mixing) results in a power-law. This is supported by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that gives rise to predictions about the growth dynamics that are consistent with correlations found in the epidemiological data. Therefore, seeing a deviation from straight exponential growth may not be a consequence of working nonpharmaceutical interventions (except for, perhaps, restricting the air travel). Instead, this is a normal course of raging infection spread. On the practical side, this cautions us against overly optimistic interpretations of the countries epidemic development and emphasizes the need to continue improving the compliance with social distancing behavior recommendations.

to some extent in younger segments of the population. The overall mortality rate further depends on the prevalence of the infection in the population: Once the number of infected individuals has reached sufficiently large sizes, health care systems become overwhelmed and lose the capacity to treat all patients in need [4] . In particular, the number of respirator units poses an important limitation, which has resulted in difficult triaging policies in some countries, most notably Italy and Spain. Non-pharmaceutical intervention methods, such as social distancing, have become an important tool in the fight against coronavirus spread [5] . The idea is to slow down the rate at which the virus spreads through human populations, and thus to maintain the number of infected individuals that require treatment below a threshold level, thus avoiding a situation in which hospitals become overwhelmed. Hence, wide-spread closures of schools and businesses, and stay-home orders, have been implemented across Asia, America, Europe, and other affected regions.A number of studies have been performed that investigated the kinetics of coronavirus spread through human populations. The pattern of virus spread was found to be approximately exponential, at least during the early stages of virus spread [6, 7] , and importantly, the basic reproductive ratio of the virus has been estimated [8, 9, 10, 11] . The implementation of social distancing measures are expected to have a significant impact on the virus spread kinetics [5] , which has been observed in some Asian countries, such as China [12] . While the effect of containment efforts have been very pronounced in these countries, they might be more subtle in other countries across the globe, especially during the initial phase following their implementation. To better assess observed virus spread trajectories following the implementation of social distancing measures, a more detailed understanding of the basic kinetics of virus spread in different countries is required. While the virus spread pattern is often quoted to be exponential [6, 7] , power law patterns have been reported in data from China [13] .In this study, we compare the per capita virus spread kinetics observed for many countries around the globe, in order to obtain a better understanding of similarities and differences. Interestingly, we find that as per capita infections grow towards larger numbers, the growth pattern deviates from exponential and is better described by a power law. This can be hypothesized to be due to social distancing measures [5] , or potentially to the build-up of immunity in the population [14] . We show, however, that the longer term per capita infection levels over time across a wide array of countries can be remarkably similar, and follow the same power law trajectory as seen in countries that are most strongly affected, such as Italy. This indicates that the long-term dynamics of COVID19 spread might be intrinsically governed by a power law, even in the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We interpret these findings with computer simulations of a metapopulation model, which can account for an initial exponential spread phase, followed by a longer-term power law behavior, by assuming that the infection spreads in a well-mixed manner inside local demes, while also spreading spatially across different demes. We relate model predictions to epidemiological correlations found in the data. These insights into the spread kinetics of COVID19 might be useful for assessing the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention methods in different countries.

Data sources

The data of confirmed COVID19 cases over time have been obtained from the data repository maintained by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) (https://datahub.io/core/covid-19#data-cli). As of March 28, 174 countries were represented in the database, as well as the cases on ""Diamond Princess"" (which were not used in the analysis). We only included the total counts for each country, even though information on the different provinces was available for several countries. The number of confirmed cases has been recorded since January 22, 2020, and has been updated daily.To compare the time course of COVID19 cases across different locations, the per capita incidence was calculated, normalizing the numbers by the total population size of the country. The information on the population size and the area of different countries was taken from Wolfram Mathematica's database, ""CountryData"".

Per capita case numbers and time lags

Here, we present the comparison of the kinetics according to which cumulative COVID19 cases grow over time in different countries around the world. Figure 1 (a) presents the raw data showing total case counts for a select number of key countries. Figure 1 (b) shows the corresponding per million case counts.A complication for comparing the growth dynamics is that the timing of the onset of community spread varies across locations. The growth curve of confirmed cases was therefore shifted in time to make them comparable, according to the following procedure. The cumulative confirmed COVID19 case counts in Italy were chosen to be the example against which the growth curves in all other countries were compared, due to Italy being a current epicenter of the outbreak. The (normalized, cases per million) infection growth curves of the other locations were shifted in time such that the difference between all data points of the country under consideration and Italy was minimized. The shift that minimized this Euclidean distance between the curves was assumed to indicate the number of days that the country lags behind Italy. Some examples of such results are presented in figure 2 . We note that this assumes that all the countries test for COVID19 at comparable levels, which is an over-simplification. If a country tests less than Italy, it will lag behind Italy to a lesser extent. Conversely, if a country tests more than Italy, 3 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .it is predicted to be further behind Italy. Reliable data on the total number of tests in different countries are currently not available to our knowledge.In this way, we obtained a time course of confirmed COVID19 cases that are temporally synchronized with Italy, which allows for a more straightforward comparison of the kinetics. 

Growth laws of the epidemic in different countries

Heterogeneity in growth laws across the different countries are observed. While some countries appear to show exponential growth of confirmed COVID19 cases, other countries appear to exhibit growth laws that deviate from exponential. Previous work [13] has suggested that a power law might be a better description of the cumulative COVID19 cases over time in China during the earlier stages of the epidemic (before it was controlled). Therefore, we hypothesized that for a subset of the countries that were analyzed, a power law is an appropriate description. To test this hypothesis, we fit both exponential and power law curves to the data for each country and determined the goodness of fit.This data fitting was performed as follows: Only the data points were considered where the number of COVID19 cases had risen above a threshold, which we set at 1 case per million people (see Appendix for variations of this threshold). We fit both a power function and an exponential function to the data to determine which model fits the data better. For the power law function, a complication arose because fitting requires knowledge of the ""zero"" point, that is, the moment of time when the growth (according to the power law) began. The fits to the data change if the time scale is changed. Hence, we started by assuming the first data point to be the day when the infection frequency first exceeded 1 case per million, and fitted the power law, a 1 x b 1 , for some constants a 1 and Figure 2 : The same data as in figure 1 (bottom), presented by shifting individuals lines to match the Italy curve. The table shows the lag, that is, by how many days each country is behind Italy. b 1 . Then we shifted the time series incrementally by one day, and for each shift the power law was fitted. For each fitting frame, a different value of the power law exponent, b 1 , was obtained. Subsequently, we fit an exponential function to the same data (a 2 e b 2 x ). The estimated exponent does not depend on the time shift, so fitting the exponential function was straightforward and yields a unique value b 2 for all the fitting frames. For both the exponential and the power law fits, we determined the sum squared error between observed and expected, and compared them. For more details of the fitting procedure, see Appendix A. Figure 3 shows the fitting errors calculated for 75 countries; we included a country if the number of cases reached 20 per million, and excluded China and South Korea, since their epidemics clearly deviate from an exponential or a power law. The yellow horizontal lines represent the exponential fitting and the blue lines the power law fitting. We observe that there are several different configurations that are repeatedly encountered.• For some countries (like the US, see also figure 4(a)), the power fitting error is always above the exponential fitting error. Such countries are clearly showing an exponential epidemic growth.• There is another group of countries (such as Italy, see also figure 4(b)), where the power law fitting error is always below the exponential error; here we clearly have a power law growth.• There are some other countries that we can classify as power law-like and exponential-5 .

Suppose a power law error curve crosses the exponential error line (see Greece, figure 4(c)), at a given frame shift. In this case, we will classify the growth as power law-like if the value of the exponent b 1 that corresponds to this frame shift satisfies b 1 < 5. Otherwise, we will classify the growth law as exponential-like.For the examples mentioned here, figure 4 shows the best fits obtained by this method. For (b) and (c) it is clear that the power law provides more satisfactory fits. More details are provided in Appendix.Since in smaller countries (such as for example Luxembourg) the laws may be harder to determine and the data are subject to a higher degree of noise, for classification purposes we restricted the pool of countries to those with over a million inhabitants. Then the following country's epidemics were classified as exponential and as a power law, see also figure 5: In the lists above, the countries that are classified as power law-like and exponentiallike are printed in gray. There are 18 countries in the exponential law class, with 9 of them being truly exponential and the rest exponential-like. There are 43 countries in the power law class, with 20 of them being truly power law and the rest power law like.

Correlates of the growth law

It is interesting that the countries showing a power law (or power law-like behavior) are different with respect to some characteristics compared to the countries showing exponential or exponential-like behavior. Figure 6 (a) shows a numerical probability distribution for the day when the infection in each country reached the level of 1 case per million. Blue represents the power law set and yellow the exponential set (grey means an overlap of the two colors). The average date of reaching 1 case per million (counting from Jan 22) is about 48 days for the power law and 52 days for the exponential set (p = 0.035 by T test). In other words, the countries that are demonstrating a power law infection spread have had the relative infection level slightly longer than the exponentially developing countries. This points us towards a hypothesis that perhaps it is typical to observe a transition between an early, exponential stage of growth, and a later, power-like stage of growth. Figure 6 (b) shows the difference between the two classes of countries in terms of 6 .

We find that the exponentially growing infection class is associated with larger countries (mean area of about 1.7 × 10 6 km 2 ) compared to the power law class (mean area about 2.3 × 10 5 km 2 , p = 0.018 by T test). Similarly, exponential epidemic spread tends to correlate with lower density countries (figure 6(c)). It is possible that it takes longer for a larger country of a lower density to transition to a power law growth. We provide a possible explanation of this correlation in the context of metapopulation modeling.

Possible explanations of the trends

It is important to understand the dynamics with which the cumulative case counts increase over time, such that we have a better ability to judge whether non-pharmaceutical 8 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . interventions (e.g. social distancing) have an impact on the course of the epidemic. The COVID19 epidemic is often thought to grow exponentially. If this is the case, a deviation from exponential growth following the introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions can indicate success of those interventions. In contrast, if the infection grows according to a power law while growth is incorrectly assumed to be exponential, a slow down of the cumulative COVID19 cases over time on a log scale can result in the false conclusion that the non-pharmaceutical intervention methods are working. If the cumulative cases grow like a power law, successful intervention would result in the growth deviating from the power law, and not from exponential growth.One interpretation of our analysis could be that in the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the disease burden grows exponentially, but that over time, the nonpharmaceutical interventions slow down the spread. Hence, overall, the disease dynamics are described better by a power law than by an exponential function, because the power law is characterized by a slow-down of the growth rate over time. Italy, where one of the most pronounced power laws was observed, implemented some degrees of social distancing relatively early, although the more strict measures were implemented only recently.

These graphs shows the spread dynamics for a few countries, whose epidemics are relatively advanced, and they have all been shifted to be temporally synchronized with Italy. As the infection spreads to higher levels, the curves for the different countries converge towards a common trajectory of the per capita cases of COVID19. In other words, as the infection spreads, the per capita number of cases converge and follow the same power law. If this deviation from exponential growth was due to nonpharmaceutical interventions, then it is surprising that those countries follow the same trajectory because they implemented those interventions at different times and to different degrees. The percentage of countries with a given delay that belong to the Power law group and to the Exponential law group. The trend that the percentage of exponential growth increases with the time lag (that is, decreases with the epidemic ""age"") is significant (p < 10 −4 by linear fitting).Alternatively, it is possible that the local epidemics characterized by power laws demonstrate an intrinsic power law spread that is independent of interventions. Computational models suggest that infection spread across networks or in spatially structured populations can lead to dynamics that follow a power law rather than an exponential trajectory, see below.If some countries truly show infection spread that is governed by a power law, the question arises why other countries show clear exponential spread, and why yet other countries are more difficult to classify. We hypothesize that different countries are at different stages of epidemic development, but they all roughly follow the same trajectory, where an initial exponential growth is gradually replaced by a more power like behavior. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047274 doi: medRxiv preprint tries until, for each country, the best match with the Italian curve was obtained. As we can see in figure 7(a) , there are only a few countries that are just behind Italy, and as the number of lag days increases, the number of countries grows. This corresponds to the world wide spread of the pandemic: more and more countries become affected as time goes by. Figure 7(b) calculates, for each lag time, the percentage of countries that were classified as following power law or exponential dynamics. We can see that for the countries that are just a few days behind Italy, 100% of them belong to the power law group. As the lag time increases, indicating an earlier stage of the epidemic, more and more countries exhibit exponential growth (p < 10 −4 ). The same trend is also corroborated by figure 6(a) that shows that the epidemics in the exponential group are ""younger"".How can we explain the existence, to different extents, of power law like behavior in different countries? One possible reason could be non-pharmaceutical interventions that are only partially effective, see a schematic in figure 8 . It is possible that in early stages of the infection, exponential virus spread occurs because people have not yet altered their behavior and continue to travel and socially mix with each other. Mass-action dynamics are expected to yield exponential growth. As a result of non-pharmaceutical interventions that are only partially effective, people might stop traveling and thus slow down large scale mixing. However, they would still be interacting locally within their social network, which would lead to a transition to power law dynamics. It is possible that a number of countries are difficult to classify because they exhibit early mass action dynamics (exponential), followed by network interactions that lead to a transition to a power law. This would indicate that stronger non-pharmaceutical intervention methods need to be implemented.More generally, the results can be interpreted in the context of a minimally parameterized metapopulation model, see figure 8 . Assume that within a local deme (such as a local community), people interact with each other, resulting in mass action dynamics. For the infection to spread further, however, people have to enter other demes, and seed the infection there. We have performed computer simulations of such a model to explore outcomes. The model is a two-dimensional metapopulation consisting of N × N patches. In each patch, i, the infection dynamics are given by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that take into account the population of susceptible (S i ), infected (I i ), recovered (R i ), and dead (D i ) individuals:11 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . Here, infection is described by a frequency-dependent infection term [15] , characterized but the rate constant β and a saturation constant . Infected individuals die with a rate ga and recover with a rate g(1 − a). The migration terms include the outward migration to n neighbors and an inward migration from all the n neighboring demes that belong to neighborhood B n i of deme i. The migration rate is denoted by f and we assume that each patch has eight direct neighbors, i.e. n = 8. The boundary demes are characterize by fewer inward/outward migrations (that is, they have smaller neighborhood sets).Using this model, we track the predicted dynamics for I + R + D over time, which represents the cumulative infection case counts. In a first scenario, we start the computer simulations with a small amount of infected individuals in a single patch, located in the center of the grid. All other patches contain only susceptible individuals. The resulting dynamics are shown in figure 9 . We observe an initial exponential phase of infection spread, followed by a transition to a power-law spread. The spread is initially exponential, because within a single patch (the first patch), the dynamics are governed by well mixed populations. As the infection spreads to other patches by migration, the overall infection spread starts to be governed by spatial dynamics, which explains the 12 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047274 doi: medRxiv preprint Next we assumed that instead of starting with infecteds only being present in a single patch, a small amount of infected individuals are initially present in more than one patch around the same time. This could correspond to larger countries, in which the infection is simultaneously seeded in multiple areas (e.g. due to travel from other places). Now, we observe overall growth dynamics that are are more exponential-like. The length of the predicted exponential phase becomes longer the more patches are initially seeded. The reason is that with more initial seeding events, the importance of spatial spread is de-emphasized. The metapopulation model can therefore predict an array of growth patterns where an exponential phase of varying length is followed by a transition to power law, depending on the initial conditions of the simulation.

Discussion and Conclusions

In this paper, we analyzed data that document the cumulative COVID19 case counts over time in a large number of countries around the world, and examined the laws according to which the infection spreads. This suggests that although the initial phase of the spread may be exponential, the longer term dynamics tend to be governed by a power law. The analysis indicates that the countries that display clear evidence for exponential growth are currently in a relatively early phase of the epidemic. The data further suggest that countries that are further along in the epidemic converge to a common power law 13 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .behavior, and cumulative per capita case counts appear to converge over time. These observations were interpreted by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that takes into account both local spread and spread across geographical space. This model predicts an initial exponential phase (due to local transmission events driving the dynamics), followed by a transition to a power law (once spatial dynamics significantly drive spread). The duration of the exponential phase is determined by the number of patches that are initially seeded with the infection. If the infection originates in a single location (patch), the exponential phase is likely not very pronounced, and most of the growth curve is predicted to follow a power law. If the infection is seeded simultaneously or nearly simultaneously in multiple locations, the duration of the exponential phase becomes longer. The larger the number of initially seeded locations, the more pronounced the exponential phase of the infection spread.These predictions are further in agreement with the correlations that we found between the growth law of the infection and country size. Exponential growth was associated with countries that are characterized by a larger area. More pronounced power laws tend to occur in counties with a smaller area. If a country has a larger area, it is more likely that multiple locations are seeded with the infection around a similar time, for example due to travelers returning from a country with a larger disease incidence. For this scenario, the metapopulation model predicts more pronounced exponential growth. If the country has a smaller area, it is more likely that the infection is seeded within one geographical area and spreads outward from there. In this case, the metapopulation predicts an infection spread pattern that mostly follows a power law.Beyond scientific interest, a better understanding of the laws according to which COVID19 spreads through populations is also of practical importance. Currently, emphasis is placed on non-pharmaceutical intervention measures to slow down the spread of the infection such that the ability of the health care system to cope with the number of incoming patients is preserved. The success of these intervention measures should be reflected in slowed infection spread. An understanding of the infection spread laws is crucial to interpret such data. If we assume that infection growth is exponential and if we plot the cumulative number of COVID19 cases on a log scale, a deviation and slow-down from exponential growth would lead to the conclusions that the non-pharmaceutical intervention measures are successful [16] . If, however, the true spread dynamics are characterized by a power law, we expect deviation and slow-down compared to exponential growth over time, even if the infection continues to spread at full force. In this case, a deviation from exponential spread cannot be interpreted to mean that non-pharmaceutical intervention measures are sufficient. To come to that conclusion, we would need to observe a deviation and slow-down of the infection spread compared to a power law null model.As with any data and modeling studies, it is important to note that results can depend on assumptions and methodologies. These are clearly spelt our here. One of the larger challenges we faced in the data analysis is the lack of knowledge at what time the infection was initiated in the individual countries. This information is not available. The time frame in turn influences the fit of the power law to the data, which we have addressed with our time shifting methodology. If further information becomes available about the time when infections are estimated to have originated in the individual countries, the methodology can be updated. Genetic studies could provide valuable data in this respect.Another limitation of the data interpretation is the degree, to which different countries test for the coronavirus. If some countries test less than others, they will appear to be further behind Italy, while in reality the lag could be shorter. This type of uncertainty however does not change the central finding that the long term dynamics of COVID19 cases in different countries follow a power law, after an initial stage of exponential growth.

A Details of the fitting

Here we present the details of the fitting procedure used to determine the growth laws for different countries. It is illustrated with the example of Italy in figure 10 . The full data for the number of cases per million in Italy are presented in figure 1(b) , orange curve. In figure 10 , the subset of same data starting from 1 case per million, is plotted on the log-log scale (panel (a)) and on a linear scale (panel (b)), with varying horizontal shift, which corresponds to changing the position of time zero. This is what we refer to as a ""fitting frame"". The fitting frame number one is when the first data point in the selected subset corresponds to day 1. The ith fitting frame shifts this point to day i. For each fitting frame, we obtained the best fit with function a 1 x b 1 , by using a built-in Mathematica routine ""FindFit"". Note that the natural logarithm of the data was fitted for the figures presented here. 1 Clearly, some fits are better than others, see figure 10(a,b) . The fitting error for each fitting frame, i, was calculated as the distance between the data and the fit, normalized by the number of points:where y Exponential fits of the same data from Italy are shown in figure 11(a,b) . In panel (a) we used a log scale, such that the exponential fits look like straight lines. It is clear that, first of all, these fits are all parallel lines and thus the error is exactly the same (thus the exponential fitting errors as functions of the fitting frame are horizontal lines, see figures 3 and 4). Second, we note that these fits are not very good for Italy, that's why the power fit errors is always below the exponential error, see figure 4 (b). For comparison, panels (c) and (d) of figure 11 show the exponential fits for the US data. We can see that the quality of the fits is better, see also figure 4(b). In the main text and in this Appendix so far, we describe a fitting procedure where the ""confirmed cases"" data for each country were used only if the numbers exceeded 1 case per million. Here we demonstrate how this changes if a different choice is made and a minimum of 5 cases per million is required for each data point to be included. In figure 12 we demonstrate the difference for 30 countries. The choice of countries for this graphics was somewhat arbitrary: we included the 30 countries out of the subset used in figure 3 that had the largest infection (cases per million).

B Best fits for different countries

Here we present plots of the best fits for different classes of countries. Figure 13 shows the 19 countries that were classified as a power law countries. The plots are presented on a log-log scale, such that the power law fits are straight lines. We can see that the best power law fit (blue) is a visibly better match than the exponential fit (yellow). Note that for all of these countries the power law fitting error for any frame shift is smaller than that obtained by the exponential fitting. The rest of the power law countries (those that were classified as power law like) are shown in figure 14 . This list contains 24 countries. For convenience, we present both a log log plot (such that the power law fits, blue, appear as straight lines) and a log plot (such that the exponential fits, yellow, appear as straight lines). Figure 15 shows the 9 countries that are characterized by a straight exponential growth. For these data, we used a log scale, such that the exponential fits are straight lines. For all of these countries the power law fitting error for any frame shift is larger than that obtained by the exponential fitting. Note however that power fits that are almost as good as exponential fits can always be found, if we we shift the frame far enough. These fits correspond to very large values of the power coefficient b 1 in the power law, see for example figure 4(a) which p"
